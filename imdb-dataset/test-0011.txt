<START> i was like an idiot during the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television i have to say that the idea of sitting down to view 90 minutes of what was bound to be pretty depressing material on a sunday was not a welcome one the thought of yet another over worthy <UNK> winning possibility did not me however the end result knocked me for 6 this is some of the best television i have seen in ages for years i was under the impression that all originality had left the <UNK> drama department our friends in the north was the last production that truly blew me away and that was 10 years ago however faith is restored and honour is satisfied david tenant was incredible so many actors i can think of would have really gone to town on a part like this but never once did i see mr tenant as an actor or as the doctor all i saw was alan hamilton i haven't had my heart <UNK> this much since daniel <UNK> performance as <UNK> <UNK> all those years ago sarah <UNK> was also incredible and i really hope this role brings her better roles in the future all of the cast were great but special mention must go to the director who really placed us inside head the <UNK> scene in particular made me feel quite <UNK>
<START> fred was such a great show it was simple but somehow very <UNK> i can still remember the days when i'd watch this on kids wb <UNK> but then kids wb did the unforgivable kids wb became like that older relative that tries to act hip and funky fresh <UNK> they became like that relative who tries to act all cool but the attempt is a cheesy disaster they pulled <UNK> <UNK> fruit <UNK> <UNK> and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows i've ever seen in my life johnny test the only thing that keeps me watching anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on <UNK> it was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule this brings me back to my first point bring it back
<START> i started watching this expecting the worst i was happy to find that the film turned out to be enjoyable slightly confusing in parts like when they all started singing it gave me a chance to see daniel wu in action for the first time he is a better actor than i thought at times he seemed a bit out of place i thought purple storm deserves its hong kong legends release as it is different to most other hk films it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss it may sound corny but when he eventually pieces out what and who he actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting once you get into the film you will find it keeps you <UNK> to it as if you miss one bit then a lot of the film <UNK> make sense for example i missed a bit at the start and i recommend to anyone that watches this that they do not miss any of it so i can say that this film was worth watching and a grateful surprise for me that i enjoyed it
<START> the growth of tax <UNK> and sale and schemes has led to a raft of films that are gathering dust in <UNK> and <UNK> all over the british <UNK> because they seem to be made purely because they fit the financial <UNK> rather than had any potential audience a lucky few get a week at a small screen in london before going to budget dvd but the <UNK> distinguished itself by completely <UNK> cinema tv or even the rental market to premiere as a free gift dvd in the mail on sunday br br it's all too easy to see why this ended up being literally given away aside from a couple of <UNK> a boom mike is clearly visible in one shot it's not particularly badly made and while <UNK> jones comes over like modern british <UNK> version of <UNK> mills mills as the <UNK> reporter who wants to move up to the crime desk and the supporting cast <UNK> from ham to vaguely passable <UNK> <UNK> themselves here by being either <UNK> good or <UNK> bad mediocrity is more the norm here the real problem is that like so many sale and tax <UNK> films it's a <UNK> film there's no reason to watch it it exists because the circumstances existed for it to be made but it lacks pace or forward momentum it seems to be aiming for the sunday <UNK> telly audience despite being shot in scope but doesn't cut it there are a couple of ideas in this <UNK> <UNK> tale of a <UNK> charles dickens <UNK> and a couple of suspicious deaths in modern day but the mystery element is so painfully obvious as is the last minute supernatural twist you'll never guess who <UNK> <UNK> tramp really is what you guessed that you're almost expecting the scooby gang or the double to turn up to solve it br br it's a very <UNK> film for all kinds of reasons a few cast members are playing double roles when they shouldn't even be playing one and the whole shock reveal of the truth of the dickens <UNK> is completely <UNK> because it's all narrated in the first person by dickens rather than the supposed character of the novel the main murder in the film is clumsily integrated into the main plot with characters suddenly reminding <UNK> that he's forgotten about that one already <UNK> an increasingly desperate final half hour that sees wicked <UNK> jason secretary puts some in drink so she can have her wicked way with him and leave <UNK> photos behind to make you look a <UNK> with your girlfriend leading to him having a dream where he talks to charles dickens you're charles what's in a name who offers the somewhat less than likely suggestion that you read too many books but all that's as nothing compared to the finale which falls into utter absurdity with logic and common sense going completely out the window as it plays like some bizarre revenge tragedy with <UNK> on the banks of the <UNK> with two day guest stars <UNK> and vanessa redgrave looking like they'd much rather be somewhere else mel smith turns up in a one day cameo so it's clear that the film's <UNK> are mainly there for an easy or to meet their <UNK> <UNK> the film's final image is so utterly absurd and pointless as to almost make it worth watching though br br one curiosity is a fairly prominent role in the first third for vera day a sort of prototype liz <UNK> and one time <UNK> of 50s british films the <UNK> in hell drivers the <UNK> in <UNK> ii here promoted to pub owner while <UNK> comedian kenny lynch turns up briefly to give the best performance as an old school gangster oh and the late <UNK> hunt makes his last bow as oh the irony a <UNK> br br just to round out the package the <UNK> dvd also included a trailer for the director's other film with <UNK> jones <UNK> bodies a <UNK> looking british horror with <UNK> scientists and <UNK> in elmer <UNK> duck hunter outfit <UNK> by a <UNK> 2000 year old <UNK> victim from the nearest <UNK> <UNK> be i'm hunting i can hardly wait br br the one thing i can guarantee however is that every indie producer in the uk is going to spend the next few weeks trying to find out exactly how much the mail paid for the license to press the dvd they paid prince 000 for his new cd with so many british tax shelter <UNK> on the shelf and with money so hard to find at the moment this could become an interesting <UNK> market for british flicks
<START> from the acting direction <UNK> and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention br br dr <UNK> is rolling in his grave right now what with the dirty ho s h i t and fake <UNK> scenes etc etc etc its shameful how they trade on the name of <UNK> to get the parents to bring their kids throw in the <UNK> to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no t a greed greed and more greed br br compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into these guys should stick to making mtv videos how on earth this movie got 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me unless its the directors family
<START> for every fan of coming of age tales this 3 hour adaptation of the br br sarah waters novel is pure fun cinematic <UNK> to <UNK> br br <UNK> style as well as to all those <UNK> and proper period pieces br br ever present on the bbc where you're likely to have seen almost br br every prominent member of this cast it's rather <UNK> and over br br the top in spots but that's just what the novel called for the cast br br is appealing and in the cases of anna <UNK> and hugh br br <UNK> perfect in the case of rachel sterling as our heroine br br <UNK> you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty to br br ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it it's a fantasy after all br br some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in br br character particularly that of <UNK> character <UNK> but br br the changes all work toward the greater good of this <UNK> and br br provide an overall high quality entertainment value
<START> yeah what did i expect i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning point in life something like or american pie which i liked a lot i wanted to see a funny film perhaps with an ironic look on <UNK> and what did i get br br attention spoilers ahead br br this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow more lengthy dialogues sometimes i thought <UNK> <UNK> might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by <UNK> and just repeating what he was saying before but as i think of <UNK> as one of the better german actors i believe that this effect really was intended i think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be especially when they are stoned but really i don't need cinema to be bored by stoned <UNK> talk boring dialogues make up most of this film br br but okay that's one thing i can cope with that i have seen nice films with <UNK> dialogues just think of <UNK> life's work but the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as <UNK> as anything just one example spoiler why do you think does someone take a garden <UNK> to his plants deep in the forest to water them of course not usually you don't find water <UNK> deep in <UNK> do you the only reason this water <UNK> is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are <UNK> their <UNK> can be drugged and finally filled up with three <UNK> of i truly hated this scene because it's really violent usually i don't mind violence in films slapstick comedies are full of it but in that sort of comedy there is a silent <UNK> between the film and you that people don't get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with <UNK> or things like that but if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough slapstick scenes also seem real in this particular scene in i really thought that this hunter must be badly injured if not dead the final scene really <UNK> in me the impression that he is left to die there totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle and the protagonists just walk away it would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style the scene could have been quite funny br br talking about being consistently that's what i missed most about this film the whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the author's mind things just happen without a apparent reason yeah i know that's life but that's not cinema because cinema is meant to tell a story not to show boring episodes without any significance i found myself asking where's the point all the time characters besides the two main ones are not <UNK> you never get to know why the <UNK> sister wants to sleep with his best friend <UNK> in fact she tells you but i could not buy it not at all i think she just was there to give <UNK> an opportunity to act this childish aids test sketch which you sure have seen a thousand times before and mostly better the <UNK> girlfriend you meet once then she leaves germany what you don't even see and the guy doesn't seem to care and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in america and <UNK> up with the protagonist it seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends he actually didn't you never really get to know what's so bad about studying law being <UNK> son daddy <UNK> everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night which to my mind made him one of the <UNK> characters in the whole film and living in beautiful even the dinner with <UNK> <UNK> friend which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to <UNK> expectations seemed flat just another nice dinner with the family's friends except for the trip the guy is on later but i think showing that eating <UNK> before you <UNK> with parents isn't healthy was not the point of this scene if there was any i have experienced far worse <UNK> in my life than this one and still finished my <UNK> i couldn't understand one single character in the whole film they just seemed flat and implausible br br all this made it a not so good film but not one i wouldn't watch again on television it really had a few good scenes most of them were not new though like the one with the nice and understanding policemen some were really funny some dialogues were nice and i like play although he repeated his well known stereotypes again this time not good not <UNK> that's what i thought after the film was half over br br but then came this incest scene and this i really found repulsive incest simply isn't funny i don't even know if this was intended to be funny some people in the audience laughed so it could have been meant this way this scene spoiled the whole film for me i couldn't feel sympathy for the protagonist any more i can't feel sympathy for anyone who f a helpless person to me this is rape and rape isn't funny so it might have been a hint of drama or so but the incest is never again mentioned although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave germany in the end but as it is never mentioned again we don't know it is even totally unnecessary i almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story but not even this final cliche is <UNK> just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film it isn't really funny it isn't really a drama it isn't at all a road movie a la tarantino despite desperate tries on violence it is definitely not enjoyable br br skip this film watch final fantasy that's also bad but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless
<START> a fine romantic comedy errol flynn shows what a <UNK> touch for comedy he possessed a talent that probably shows some of his true <UNK> self the comedic writing on this film is excellent <UNK> parker does a nice job as <UNK> ex wife whom errol is trying to win back <UNK> is also easy on the eyes the sets <UNK> 1940's <UNK> and style where appropriate br br <UNK> comedic timing and wit are displayed to full effect here watch his double takes his ability to <UNK> counter punch with a snappy comeback or act the straight man and his total believability and sincerity where required this guy could act it is a shame errol did not get a chance to do more roles like this throughout his career he was multi talented to the extreme if you enjoyed it happened one night with gable and <UNK> or some of the william powell and myrna loy comedies you will enjoy this br br well paced and lots of laughs a lost diamond of a movie
<START> i didn't expect much when i decided to watch this movie so i was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it a couple of scenes had me laughing almost <UNK> the characters were engaging no pun intended however the story is predictable the fun of it comes from watching crawl <UNK> character a <UNK> yet wise california dude a country college girl brings home for <UNK> trying in his awkward yet endearing way to fit in to their lifestyle i was also surprised that in all this there was a message if you have a chance see this movie
<START> i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no <UNK> in reviewing it now the acting is ridiculous half the cast must be retired porno actors and to get kicked off <UNK> you could imagine the quality of acting br br the graphics are unlike anything i have ever seen i think there are puppet shows with more believability they can't even afford <UNK> for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters perhaps i should also note how incredibly impressed i am at the number of their <UNK> can hold br br if asked to <UNK> the movie i would say that someone had up a group of complete no <UNK> at the local county fair slapped them on an island added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing br br i can honestly not <UNK> any possible explanation for why this movie was released recorded on dvd and costs 6 from my local video store for one day if anything i have received the benefit of knowing that i am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film br br i hate this movie with great intensity why i wish i knew captain i wish i knew
<START> i didn't really concentrate on the larger <UNK> aspects of the story although the horrific images at the beginning are very powerful i was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family imagine living your life not knowing if you have a time bomb <UNK> away inside you i was really wrenching to see being rejected as <UNK> by the bomb the image that stays with me most is when stands before the mirror <UNK> her hair <UNK> watching it come out in
<START> a wonderful film a charming quirky family story a cross country journey filled with lots of interesting oddball stops along the way several very cool cameos great cast led by rod <UNK> carries the film along and leads to a surprise ending well directed shot a really nice movie
<START> newly released on dvd in the us just stay far away from it br br i usually give plenty of room for stupidity in horror films i'll settle for nearly anything remotely suspenseful supernatural spooky or even just a vaguely interesting concept this one simply <UNK> i knew there was trouble when <UNK> best friend in college who had considerable screen time wasn't even listed in the credits on imdb i wasn't surprised not <UNK> any actors but that character or day <UNK> or whatever her name was apparently didn't even exist br br i'm so embarrassed that i actually paid a rental <UNK> for this garbage deeply deeply ashamed
<START> oz is an old tv series released by hbo it shows the life in one security prison called <UNK> but the main plot is focused on <UNK> city which is one of the prison levels br br oz have an amazing plot and an outstanding cast there are many of characters and almost all of them are very interesting basically they are divided in groups gangs the the black people the <UNK> the gays the <UNK> and many others who doesn't have any specific group but deal with many others like ryan <UNK> the irish br br the plot is very well built there are a lot of conspiracy inside a lot of fight for the power but all of this is not just exposed in form of violence all is very intelligent and smart nothing happens without a reason all is connected and very interesting to guess i really love this series and who wanna see something intelligent very well produced with a very good cast and performances must see oz
<START> this movie was just so utterly horrible that i couldn't get through the entire thing without turning it off it was just that bad when i was watching it i kept thinking it looked like some really cheap film made back in the 60's or something with those terrible looking special effects but then i realized that this was just made in 2001 br br the dialog and the acting were really very horrible and the plot was almost non existent i didn't think anyone would go back to making films that look so cheap and old i'm not sure if they did that on purpose or if they really didn't have any budget for this movie at all it really looks like it was shot on someone's camcorder at a local person's house or something maybe they thought they were being retro or something but it just comes off looking really cheesy br br i really don't know how anyone could ever actually enjoy watching this br br 0 out of 5 's
<START> terror 2 10 it was the navy seal team that <UNK> the balance from bad cheesy movie to just bad up till then there was a lot of bad movie <UNK> but the they are wearing <UNK> <UNK> painted black you know the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool of course the bass fishing boat they took to <UNK> the cruise ship might have been another clue it wouldn't make it across <UNK> bay let alone an ocean  and their tactics wouldn't pass <UNK> on an 3rd rate <UNK> game br br does director john have photos of john rhys davies in a <UNK> position with a <UNK> because i can't think of any other reason he would be in this movie the other actors have a great excuse they are talentless unattractive <UNK> that couldn't get hired for an <UNK> the plot is that two men try to <UNK> the mythical love saying that name aboard a cruise ship and it gets loose br br the sets consist of horrible cruise ship <UNK> complete with the size of a small apartment the monster killings are bottom of the barrel there is no nudity and a lot of really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes of particular annoyance is a <UNK> character from a 60's doris day movie br br the cast <UNK> <UNK> while the <UNK> day green glow in the dark blood why a goat eating mexican <UNK> would bleed anything but red is beyond me br br every b movie has a <UNK> point that makes it a fun time hey it's a lesbian shower scene <UNK> that guy just ate is own <UNK> or not so fun did they just call those forty something overweight guys wearing and <UNK> <UNK> navy <UNK> falls into the not so fun b movie side with a <UNK>
<START> i hate to admit it but they were right to sack <UNK> the opportunity is here to build an atmosphere to draw an audience into a movie it wasn't done the characters are weak the story was weak the directing was very poor <UNK> was out of his depth and it shows i've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature but no nothing the next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left well alone anyone wanting to know what the best sequel to the exorcist was should read <UNK> penned by <UNK> it has to be the best follow up to an original piece to be committed to print sadly it did not translate to to screen very well and i doubt if it ever could be as for <UNK> beginning avoid at all costs
<START> i am surprised people after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7 <UNK> i thought more people would get a kick out of throw <UNK> from the train this was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors billy crystal and danny <UNK> together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession billy is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead danny has an insane and <UNK> old mother who just <UNK> him when billy gives some misunderstood advice to danny danny offers a <UNK> to billy if he kills his ex wife billy has to kill his mother this is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh please sit back and enjoy this movie people it's a good one br br 7 10
<START> i normally don't comment on movies on imdb but in this case i feel like i should i love movies and i want to make them and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmaking br br this is one of the few movies that i have seen on the small screen originally seeing it air on <UNK> i believe and then on the dvd i just watched that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach that little <UNK> sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thriller br br jack <UNK> performance is a fine one and jane fonda and michael douglas follow i felt so much empathy of lemmon who's character jack only wanted people to listen to his warning br br but what <UNK> me most about this film is the lack of a score and this is also what makes it beautiful to me apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension because none is needed and while the credits run white on black in silence it drives the point home br br i use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie i think the movie should make the movie and the music should only <UNK> that but for the china syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here the characters portray all of this far better than the music ever could br br i highly recommend this movie it is one of my favorites if you like movies you won't be disappointed if you like movie <UNK> more you might not want to give this one a go
<START> today being <UNK> day my wife and i had the <UNK> dvd checked out at our local library it's a movie released in 2004 that fell beneath our radar as we are big movie goers i'm a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book i'd noticed references to the <UNK> in reviews of other movies which is why i brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity we both really liked it it made my wife cry we could relate to many things in it with our own continuing love affair and even i fought back <UNK> up br br this afternoon after lots of <UNK> yard work and eating we decided to actually catch a <UNK> when we got to the theater having seen most of the current <UNK> of films playing we elected to see victoria day which for some reason was not at the theater even though both imdb and my phone movies showed it playing there so instead we looked at the poster for dear john and that it was written by the same writer as the <UNK> making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed so much br br what a disappointment first the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities two dozen or so quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but as another reviewer commented a poor man's <UNK> it had a real feeling meaning the sparks simply threw a story together based on the exact <UNK> of simply to make a quick buck not only that after the <UNK> <UNK> john's <UNK> for the <UNK> cancer patient we <UNK> the movie with each passing <UNK> stupid line all the way through to the end there were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4 monday <UNK> and my wife even told me to keep it down so i wouldn't ruin it for the others it was so bad br br seeing this on the heels of <UNK> that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and sparks blatant cheap attempt at <UNK> writing painfully obvious we only wish we could've seen victoria day instead no matter how bad it <UNK> been after seeing this poor entry to cinema and oh for the last 30 minutes i kept saying don't give that cow the <UNK> don't give that cow the <UNK>
<START> i was <UNK> in by the big names rob lowe mario van <UNK> burt reynolds and the fact that it was an independent film unbelievably slow beginning 35 minutes two dreary songs and a <UNK> rip off i didn't care about the characters and the plot never tempted me to even pretend it could be realistic i can't believe this is what makes it to the screen i loved watching this film because it felt so good when it was over
<START> watched this months ago on netflix instant and left a review there br br let me say most of the other reviews are very accurate this movie was bad writing bad acting and bad directing i too had liked russell and <UNK> back in the old days and was very hopeful for them in my netflix review i mentioned that i lost interest in the film and <UNK> to wash the <UNK> and make a <UNK> yet still watching the movie from the kitchen when i did return to the living room i was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film <UNK> i even <UNK> it to make sure i was not missing anything this film totally <UNK> out on how to do a twist ending i suspect that the idea sounded good maybe the script was intriguing but the budget was so non existent that sets were really lacking and yes i suppose all those bad sets were an effort to give the viewer a clue all it told me was low budget br br anyway the reason i came here was because over the weekend i saw a review of <UNK> island and with what the reviewers were saying or not saying lead me to believe that <UNK> island is the same deal only with a budget 50 to 60 times more actually i have no idea how much dark world cost but i hope they didn't spend more than 1 million br br so that being said i kinda thought that if someone <UNK> the script a bit got a bigger budget for a better look whether that meant a better <UNK> designer or better post <UNK> just someone with a vision they could remake dark world into a passable product now it sounds like <UNK> island is doing that looks like they got the vision right but the scripting could still be off money can't buy everything but it should in hollywood br br ps my 2 star rating is for russell and <UNK>
<START> although this film has had a lot of praise i personally found it boring there are some nice <UNK> and the characters are believable but the story of how they even if very unusual by our standards is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close <UNK> way and putting the interests of her children first as the tolerance of the various men is stretched we see their characters develop the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting it is a rare glimpse into the <UNK> far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep one's eyes open for
<START> great movie about a great man thomas <UNK> is first rate as in all of his other movies i would never have <UNK> him as <UNK> john paul it speaks volumes for the casting director why do they keep casting him as german officer in the movies and he only came to universal attention after the <UNK> of course he looks so hot in the uniforms i know a lot of girls <UNK> over his handsome face but this guy is a great actor and has such great <UNK> if you don't believe me go watch <UNK> i hope he will get a lot of excellent roles in the future with more diversity otherwise what a heartbreaking waste of great talent
<START> i have seen and enjoyed all of the <UNK> movies and i must say they keep getting better better with each one <UNK> phillips is fantastic and my <UNK> wants to be just like her i'm glad they brought in a brother character for <UNK> <UNK> so we can expect to see more exciting shows <UNK> is beautiful sexy and sweet and independent at the same time and everything any female could desire to be
<START> not really all that much to this movie either a stunt <UNK> or a stock car <UNK> has a <UNK> car in the beginning of the movie goes to bar is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady offer him a job he goes back to their place refuses the police ask him to accept their ya go what plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them i am not sure why the female biker did what she did at the end but hey it is a bad movie you always get scenes that make little sense i am still trying to figure out if i <UNK> it when they said the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver they may have said stock car driver because why would a stunt <UNK> be racing and i wouldn't think it would be all that <UNK> for a stunt car to crash the actors are bad and all the <UNK> are pretty annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent really this movie is not full of kicks but it is the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count br br in what was merely a <UNK> of what was to come murray rules the screen in what can only be described as comic <UNK> harrison is one of the greatest comedy characters in the past 50 years sarcastic all the time smart when he has to be stern when he needs to be and caring when it suits him murray <UNK> with that snl <UNK> in the eye br br the c i <UNK> are merely in awe as they <UNK> beneath the comic genius that is mr murray br br summer isn't summer without a viewing of <UNK> one of the best comedies to ever grace the screen
<START> another <UNK> but <UNK> from about the same time as out of <UNK> is <UNK> flower with a great cast goldie hawn in her first film appearance pre ingrid in one of her later ones and the ever funny walter matthau the story is about a dentist who pretends to be married in order to have an excuse for not marrying his girlfriend leading to the need to come up with a <UNK> wife for proof he his <UNK> <UNK> bergman into taking the role leading to multiple comic disasters and surprising romantic turns it's in the same vein as the doris day rock hunter comedies fans of those as i am will like this movie if not don't bother
<START> produced by <UNK> entertainment this movie is <UNK> very good at all i sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad the casting is bad and camera work is bad as i hear that there is a <UNK> of this film floating around on the internet it is <UNK> even worth the <UNK> br br up until the time i wrote this review the average vote for this movie was an 8 5 which <UNK> me to view it and there was an average high majority of <UNK> for it obviously voted on by <UNK> and <UNK> this movie is <UNK> for everyone or parents if you want to <UNK> your kids with this awful film have them sit through this one for halloween
<START> a wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an <UNK> well beyond it's initial <UNK> based on a true story one of the many small stories prior to <UNK> ii that lend an understanding to the <UNK> of the majority of common man cultures <UNK> by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future <UNK> with the <UNK> of war clouds on the horizon viewed at the <UNK> <UNK> film festival the film was <UNK> received well written and expertly cast the characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and <UNK>
<START> i've watched the movie actually several times and what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the incredible performance absolutely nothing but that not even those silly model named <UNK> and some of these popular names at times in the movie is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through even though this is kind of horror movie he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too i bet most of you all saw the movie and tv series those two would go for an example all i'm gonna say is you better watch out for the new works coming out from then you'll see keep the good work <UNK> much love
<START> and i am afraid that i cannot imagine why it really is a genuinely dire and exceptionally boring film in some ways it is reminiscent of early science fiction when every set had been knocked up on a hollywood back lot out of whatever was lying around from the <UNK> and unconvincing set <UNK> seem to be about ten <UNK> away apparently made of <UNK> to the actors who are also apparently made of <UNK> with amusing stereotypes painted <UNK> on top to the oddly warm pool in a frozen cave to the survival of the cast <UNK> when medium <UNK> <UNK> burst a few <UNK> away on open ground and finally the awful script that reads like a training <UNK> more than a film i really cannot say how dull this is even the opportunity to see whether the young james dean survived wasn't enough to keep me watching for more than an hour this really is one to be avoided at all costs
<START> this is a fantastic film is a very old guy with a very young heart he knows how to live his live fully everyday by <UNK> up with his friend making pranks on just about everything even his own death while his wife can't deal with his irresponsible behavior she also knows that it's exactly why she loves her husband for almost half century i would love to hang out with this old guy because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear of death he is <UNK> witty mischievous and never boring brilliantly played at the age of <UNK> every look from his eyes and every move from his aging <UNK> deliver so much about the character to the audience this is a film that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards and it makes me look at my own live a little closer tomorrow i am gonna go and buy myself a mansion and have some fun if can so can i but i think i will skip the smoking part
<START> but george and <UNK> are not among them the movie is fun and the pool table scene with <UNK> fields has to be among the funniest i have ever seen but <UNK> and george are more irritating than comical in their roles partly from script <UNK> and partly from their interpretation i gave it a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast <UNK> is a treasure of comedic timing and energy in this one
<START> i saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on imdb after wishing i had those 90 minutes of my life back i feel it's my duty to get on here myself and say please don't bother watching this movie br br i can't argue with the actors efforts they did what they could given the material but that material is dreadful the pace was deadly slow meandering and you saw everything coming about an hour away and then it took forever to happen the dialogue was boring pointless not funny at all the characters were all completely unsympathetic and the cinematography was in my opinion very low quality the cliché of character uses home video machine was used to very bad effect br br yes <UNK> ryan is a cool person don't let that sucker you into wasting your time on this film
<START> i rarely watch short films as they only seem to be on late night television and are not <UNK> enough for me to know which short films are worth while as the room is an extra feature on the <UNK> dvd it gave me a wonderful opportunity to witness a high quality short with <UNK> <UNK> in excellent form br br artistically shot in black and white the room explores a man's obsession with a room he passed by in the early stages of <UNK> and is expressed in a documentary interview style the dialogue is very poetic typical of a man expressing his feelings for a woman but is also <UNK> with <UNK> and occasional <UNK> in this adds great realism and depth to performance who is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him br br the piano music that harry <UNK> hears from the room is constantly in the background and enhances the touching atmosphere of the film and <UNK> the feelings of sadness expressed by <UNK> br br <UNK> proves he is more than just a psychotic hollywood bad guy with this role and perfectly displays his more sensitive side is also effective in the flashback scenes as young harry with a silent role he shows how affected he is by the music and his disappointment when it goes away br br the ending is <UNK> and leaves you in a <UNK> mood longer than many feature length films a very good effort
<START> writer director jay andrews a k a jim <UNK> serves up more of his characteristic <UNK> with a decent cast <UNK> by grade z computer generated <UNK> in <UNK> vs <UNK> as generic a rip off of mysterious island meets jurassic park as you can imagine the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters <UNK> on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects the <UNK> and the <UNK> are hilariously awful however the graphics people do an okay job of <UNK> the monsters with their victims not that any of this is in the least believable clearly <UNK> vs <UNK> had a budget that so low that virtually everything non human in its looks as fake as all get out this cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the u s military <UNK> top secret <UNK> testing on animals the result is that gigantic and <UNK> <UNK> in this <UNK> island paradise as the action opens the primary scientist is <UNK> up by a <UNK> that likes to swim after we are introduced to a group of like <UNK> <UNK> and a journalist planet one <UNK> jerry ryan ryan of <UNK> pays <UNK> boat <UNK> jim <UNK> michael <UNK> of cbs tv's <UNK> knights five grand with the promise of another five grand if he will take them to this forbidden island meanwhile the u s military suspect that something is <UNK> on the island so they send their own team of men who give eaten by the <UNK> our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island dr susan richardson michelle of wonderland the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project who tells them that the military is going to target the island for destruction the title match between the two <UNK> <UNK> occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes who have been consistently <UNK> down by the monsters find a helicopter and take off in time before the military <UNK> the island there's no tension suspense or anything worthwhile in this <UNK> creature feature the best thing about this <UNK> is composer chuck <UNK> soundtrack it gives <UNK> vs <UNK> an epic feel usually jay andrews writes and directs tolerable drivel but this ranks far below his low standards the sexy women fare better at survival than the guys in one scene our heroic group <UNK> a river and we don't get to see any wet t shirts <UNK> there's nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this dreck i think that the military guys do far too much <UNK> when they get their heads together to <UNK> let's hope that michael <UNK> got a good <UNK> out of this garbage the ending as one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an <UNK> it's not so bad it's good it's just bad
<START> the <UNK> of <UNK> 8 10 br br this review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and so may be thought of as containing spoilers to anyone unfamiliar with the plot br br as a film version of the famous shakespeare play <UNK> of <UNK> does what few adaptations have done since <UNK> rather gritty <UNK> it takes the spirit of the play and brings it out not just as well as but better than the play alone could readily achieve br br lord of the rings director peter jackson has <UNK> that in adapting a book or play there are three <UNK> attempt to <UNK> the original as perfectly as possible use the original idea as an inspiration but take full license for cinematic change or the one he <UNK> preferred stick to the original as much as is cinematic ally <UNK> but make such changes as are necessary for the film and while remaining faithful to the intention or spirit of the original br br in <UNK> polanski used the rain <UNK> <UNK> and realistic rapes and murder to convey what a bloody and horrific period the play was set in thus bringing to mind the horrific context in which the characters make such ill advised decisions it <UNK> from say branagh's hamlet which achieved new heights of faithful rendition but otherwise offered little new <UNK> on the other hand maybe <UNK> audiences fresh to shakespeare to appreciate some of the <UNK> <UNK> without extensive study similarly more familiar audiences might find a greater depth than the stage performance could accomplish such interpretation plays a vital part if audiences are to fully engage not only intellectually but also emotionally with the points shakespeare wanted to make br br adaptation of <UNK> of <UNK> does just this it takes crucial moral <UNK> involving religious <UNK> or the keeping promises and with minimal messing of the <UNK> holy <UNK> conveys them <UNK> within the spirit of the original story br br the first of these religious <UNK> gives meaning to otherwise outlandish behaviour we see the jews of the period <UNK> to a <UNK> ghetto only allowed out if wearing an <UNK> red cap not being allowed to own property one of the few ways they can earn a living is by money <UNK> this makes them both useful to their christian <UNK> and at the same time the object of their <UNK> the idea behind both old and new testament biblical <UNK> against <UNK> probably <UNK> from not making a profit by helping one's friends this is extended by the <UNK> christians to curse those they spit on we see <UNK> not only spit on but fellow jews thrown into the for sport in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening br br the of the film is curious since the <UNK> of right wing christianity as <UNK> by bush following americans has turned full circle as they are now the main supporters of <UNK> and the jewish political leaders bite at their palestinian neighbors much as <UNK> tries to bite at antonio once he thinks the law gives him the power to do so the psychology is self evident kick a dog repeatedly and it will become vicious the circle easily continues as the victims of <UNK> themselves easily lose their sense of moral values and become <UNK> br br the <UNK> of hand that the disguised uses to save antonio has some merit both as a clever interpretation of the <UNK> law that the of the play so <UNK> and also as a moral <UNK> <UNK> may <UNK> his pound of <UNK> according to his contract but may not have any blood an easy <UNK> could be made as far as <UNK> and terrorism goes it is much easier to justify fighting among <UNK> or attacking ill <UNK> if soldiers or evil <UNK> are the only victims when there is massive <UNK> damage as when innocent citizens including women and children are killed in their hundreds the arguments whether those be israeli palestinian or us american carry far less popular support br br there has long been much argument whether shakespeare was being anti <UNK> in this story one wonders if he had to adapt the ending for a largely christian audience who had little dealing with jewish people far from teaching him a greater good the ending <UNK> christianity and <UNK> upon <UNK> a course likely simply to <UNK> <UNK> up <UNK> both camps look just as bad one simply holds more power than the other the slight of the judgment simply gives the christian judges a better public image or as so <UNK> <UNK> when choosing the <UNK> and solving the <UNK> to win hand br br in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and <UNK> it with a text hiding the <UNK> with fair <UNK> there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his <UNK> parts br br of course the <UNK> applies to <UNK> religion rather than <UNK> especially when <UNK> for political purposes but one that easily ordinary god <UNK> people who are not in the habit of splitting <UNK> the kindness mercy in <UNK> which is so fundamental to true christianity is something also <UNK> to a wonderful degree in <UNK> as in most <UNK> the jewish faith <UNK> between kindness and charity ways of practicing both effectively and ways of making it part of one's being rather than just an <UNK> show both <UNK> and antonio are <UNK> and use their respective <UNK> to abuse those of another faith while shakespeare maybe pointed up the <UNK> between the goodness <UNK> by different <UNK> and its absence in practice the film version <UNK> much of the window for interpretations of anti <UNK> and brings a greater degree of realism to the psychological causes br br the keeping of promises the men to their wives is dealt with less well as are the comic elements inherent in the cross dressing sub plots however strong his love for antonio are there homosexual elements there cannot make sound moral <UNK> when showing his <UNK> to the and so breaks his promise for which <UNK> him displaying a character for women not only as <UNK> intelligent and witty but also as more truly <UNK> and <UNK> of others than her <UNK> male counterparts including her husband br br some of the acting is a bit stilted and there are too many <UNK> english accents but on the whole <UNK> of <UNK> delivers a fresh and rewarding <UNK> of shakespeare i enjoyed the acting and also the very beautiful soundtrack by <UNK> and others singing <UNK> penned both by shakespeare and edgar allen poe all in all <UNK> of <UNK> is a not achievement of british as far as any film can be said to be of a particular <UNK> these days cinematic tradition
<START> i don't mind sequels sometimes they're better than the original however many times the originals are best left alone especially when you can't <UNK> the cast one of the big reasons the magnificent seven was such a hit was the very popular cast br br this is hardly the magnificent seven when only <UNK> <UNK> returns as one of the members of that famous group in the magnificent seven with six of the seven guys absent and replaced by much lesser known actors this loses its appeal in a hurry in other words except for <UNK> these guys have no charisma this is a like a championship sports team <UNK> all <UNK> except one br br <UNK> is good once again fun to watch fun to hear with that distinctive deep voice of his but the story not just the rest of the crew is lame this movie should never have been made in the original we cared about the seven in here we couldn't care less
<START> <UNK> a <UNK> do <UNK> deals with what is perhaps the greatest of all brazilian themes poverty and along with poverty the other unnatural feelings and actions it brings prostitution violence crime rape and murder br br brazil is the country of <UNK> and its social problems are present everywhere the difference between the rich and the poor the beautiful and the ugly happiness and the most profound human <UNK> br br <UNK> is one of the films that dare to touch and open these so painful wounds and does it without the slightest <UNK> of hope in an honest portrayal of a country that like <UNK> himself is already lost
<START> if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school try to convince your teacher to see something else believe me anything is better than this movie it is slow paced confusing boring poorly constructed gory do i need to go on it's message is good but i have seen them been handled better in several other films the acting isn't even any good this movie is just even more awkward as it start off as being funny not <UNK> though because of it's surreal story than at the end just becomes uncomfortable to watch br br i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a <UNK> for 10 minutes than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear witness a sort of rape than see the female lead role eat her husband br br honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1 10 and if your not happy with my preview seriously i'm an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism but this movie was just awful make any excuse you can to avoid this film
<START> if you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isn't it if you're looking for a comedic masterpiece this isn't it if you're looking for something hardcore this isn't it br br that being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of european erotic comedy from the the early mid 1970's this is it br br i see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974 yes the women do not <UNK> to the modern ideal of <UNK> they are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are <UNK> in our <UNK> culture yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking german and anyone who speaks any german will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with 12 <UNK> br br if you have seen the dvd prior to the latest release it is <UNK> with 2 covers of 80's and recently 90's adult stars the film is an r film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this the film is edited from the original but it was also edited prior to its run in the drive ins in the late 1970s br br i first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on <UNK> many people become upset when later in life it doesn't live up to their previous memories it's understandable considering the <UNK> and nudity packed into todays <UNK> br br if you compare to a modern soft core erotic comedy you may be disappointed the film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally <UNK> and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle if you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed compared to today you see very little br br it is still one of the best examples along with <UNK> up and the other cinderella of european erotic comedic cinema of the 1970's
<START> i don't know where to begin perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen there is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping i don't know what was more offensive the subject matter or david <UNK> performance it was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off although i think the bull felt better afterwards the filmmakers should find something about sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show like i don't know his talent as a singer his family shouldn't have to <UNK> that horror thank god it was just shown on hbo and not released in theaters please don't watch this if you have any self respect
<START> first of all i'm not one to go all sappy over movies i saw friends in the 70's when it was first released i was about 17 years old at the time even now at age 50 i still can remember some of the scenes the movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but i loved it the story is about innocence the <UNK> of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home at the time it was pretty <UNK> to have a movie about a couple of young <UNK> who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own i'm not surprised the movie and <UNK> john's soundtrack are almost unknown today the music is beautiful it was unforgettable
<START> <UNK>  the kings of comedy or was it horror whatever wake after years of <UNK> and yes i did get scared no not because of the horror element of course i am not that <UNK> but because rats were constantly dancing on my feet in the theatre where else do such movies run br br so check the plot a man is repeatedly stabbed <UNK> to death stuffed in plastic and dumped in a pool but he still returns to take revenge now was the film a thriller or a horror that itself is the suspense for you to discover and the end turns out to be another mask mystery remember those trademark <UNK> undercover agents  men wearing some stupid horror masks only here the mask is of a human i suppose no more <UNK> is required to skip this flick br br tends to get over dramatic and theatrical forgetting the difference between cinema and tv <UNK> a cheaply and dressed in her typical pink <UNK> looks like  uh you know what br br the background score is a straight lift from alfred hitchcock's psycho not a single department of the film whether technical or creative is worth commenting novelty lacks both in story and execution br br certainly your senses
<START> man this movie is awesome especially the part they show the italian chick damn <UNK> incredibly hot <UNK> not your average italian i would go see that movie over and over just to see that chick i really enjoyed the movie really hot girl <UNK> steamy sexy also the actor are really good but the girl is better i think the actor played a better part in pride and prejudice so i don't think he acted in his highest level but yeah back to the girl i mean <UNK> gorgeous perfect and i could only wish her luck in her future movies yeah also her acting skills in such young age was awesome i was just amazed wit her performance what a great actress so yeah i recommend everybody this great movie
<START> being the sci fi fan that i am i was always curious about this film so i was excited to see journey to the far side of the sun finally get released on an <UNK> dvd the previous print had been <UNK> 100 on ebay i'm sure those people wish they had their money back but more about that in a second br br anyway the premise of this film just like twilight the parallel is that there is an <UNK> planet resembling earth on the other side of the sun this planet is of course exactly like <UNK> except that it's <UNK> this basically means their letters are <UNK> and people drive on the wrong side of the road br br sound intriguing well that's basically all there is to this film the first hour or so is dedicated to the <UNK> for the journey to this other planet it's just tedious scenes of switches being pressed banal dialog etc there's no point to it whatsoever <UNK> anderson managed to find the most boring british actors in the history of cinema to play most of the roles i mean they are so dull i'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to finish the film br br anyway once the crew finally lands on the planet after an interminable sequence of the <UNK> sitting and literally sleeping in the <UNK> roy <UNK> notices the copy is all backwards on a bottle of <UNK> and <UNK> back on another ship to tell people about what he has discovered <UNK> he never gets to do it as he crash lands and dies the end oh wait there's a bonus scene of one of the space executives <UNK> himself into a mirror in his wheelchair at the end i guess he wanted out of this film too br br i'm really surprised a film like this could get made even back in the 60s rent if you must do not buy
<START> first of all before i start my review i just read every review for 'the muppet <UNK> here and i can't believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this fortunately there was only one i mean i can understand how someone may not like <UNK> <UNK> due to the whole sci fi genre but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad br br okay i will step off my <UNK> now and review this movie br br 'the muppet <UNK> came out when i was seven all of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie so i think i saw it about four times in the first month in theaters br br as a child many things attracted me to this and all the other muppet movies tv shows the singing was probably the main one most of the songs in 'the muppet <UNK> are classics from <UNK> connection to i'm going to go back there someday they're entertaining and thought provoking br br as an adult i see 'the muppet <UNK> in almost a whole different light yes the things that thrilled me about it as a kid are still there but it's the little jokes and such that are just plain hilarious br br i mean when you think about it jim <UNK> is a sick man br br <UNK> is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple <UNK> and could karate chop you into two pieces <UNK> is a stand up comedian bear <UNK> is a that is <UNK> with <UNK> then you have two old guys that <UNK> a piano playing dog a rock band with a maniac drummer a swedish chef that you can't understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentric br br yet for these reasons and more <UNK> has entertained millions of children and adults giving us all something special to watch and remember him by br br 'the muppet <UNK> will always remain in my heart for many reasons but i think the biggest one is because it's a movie unlike a lot of recent children's movies that i feel comfortable to have my kids watch plus i don't get bored out of my mind with jokes that are <UNK> down to my kids' level br br it's a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever
<START> now i remember what the filmmakers were ripping off before pulp fiction it was david lynch right br br i hunted this thing down to see kyle <UNK> what a waste of a perfectly good <UNK> it was so painful to watch him sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and there's nothing you can do br br nearly every cliche in the book the desert the psycho the quirky mob boss the biker tracy walker who fortunately was only in one scene but i kept expecting him to <UNK> and say something strange and profound like if a man wants to know where he's going he's got to look at where he's been or some contrived garbage like that i have a theory as to why so many <UNK> are short on location in the desert i think it's because they can save money on lighting br br if you like to be in pain find this movie and give it a viewing if you're a fan of kyle <UNK> watch reruns of homicide on court tv if you want a good quirky road thriller check out wild at heart br br there is a reason that no one has heard of <UNK> my god what a waste of a good title
<START> this was the first chan film made by <UNK> what a come down from fox values and standards i was shocked when i saw my first <UNK> after seeing the great fox films this is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as chan <UNK> walks across the street chan is now working for the us secret service rather than the <UNK> police department he is <UNK> by benson <UNK> who plays no 3 son tommy for the first time he also has a daughter along <UNK> chan played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also makes his debut as <UNK> brown he is a cab driver in washington <UNK> here rather than the later <UNK> to chan in the later films
<START> there were so many reasons why this movie could have been great i'll give you three br br 1 <UNK> she is extremely hot in this movie and was the reason i chose to watch it in the first place br br 2 tim <UNK> amazing bad guy and i always get excited seeing him in movies even home alone 2 br br 3 jason <UNK> for all you <UNK> and <UNK> out there this is a rare treat former <UNK> star 80's heart <UNK> dressed in drag selling drugs br br however none of these things nor the fact that the movie is about the drug rave culture managed to make this movie even remotely interesting the script was dull the performances ordinary and despite the scenes with j d and any scene with <UNK> i found everything about this movie pretty <UNK> br br 3 out of 10
<START> broadcast news is directed by james l brooks terms of <UNK> as good as it gets and has a great cast including william hurt albert brooks and holly hunter everyone gives a good performance but they're all too unlikable to really care about them br br some parts of the film are really brilliant such as the prologue and the short scenes with jack nicholson the main reason it doesn't entirely work is it's a film that relies on the characters being amusing rather than amusing things happening to them br br you could consider it nothing more than a drama but it's often too silly to be successful there as well still the script makes it worth a watch certainly not for everyone br br 7 0 out of 10
<START> this is an epic film about the <UNK> of the ancient <UNK> of china in the third century <UNK> what makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him it reminded me a bit of king <UNK> and some of the other shakespeare plays br br the king starts out with noble ambitions to <UNK> the <UNK> under one <UNK> and to stop all the <UNK> so that the people can <UNK> and lead better lives he and his childhood sweetheart played beautifully by li <UNK> <UNK> a scheme <UNK> she pretends to go into <UNK> in a rival kingdom in order to <UNK> an assassin to kill the king thus giving him a <UNK> to go to war but while she's away the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spree br br there are numerous side plots that keep the action going there is the marquis who pretends to be stupid and <UNK> but who's really very clever and wants to become king himself he fathers two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years then there is the prime minister a political rival to the king who turns out to really be his father br br the assassin is a complex character himself an <UNK> <UNK> and killer he is <UNK> a when the king's lover comes to <UNK> him he wants nothing more with killing but is eventually won over by li <UNK> who wouldn't be when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become br br some spectacular cinematography especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale like they used to say a cast of thousands literally the acting is ok nothing special it's the story that's interesting though at over two and a half hours it pushes the limit br br definitely worth viewing
<START> sure most people will <UNK> island of the as silly and trashy <UNK> but can you honestly name one other movie that brings forward this many <UNK> themes this italian gem stands for pure entertainment and features stuff like voodoo <UNK> <UNK> mutant fish creatures the mysterious continent of atlantis treasure hunting a remote island filled with death traps and utterly mad scientists all this and much more in one simple movie yes please close minded opponents of italian horror cinema can easily tag this film as a cheap exploitation version of the island of dr <UNK> but the truth is that this is so much more island of the delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and astonishingly stylish camera work the story <UNK> opens with a small group of prisoners survivors of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> island they encounter the sadistic <UNK> who rules over a native a legion of <UNK> created monsters that live in the <UNK> <UNK> there are so many twists and additional sub plots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary but trust me this gem is worth checking out sergio martino once again proves that he's an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercial minded and creative at the same time he makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive the <UNK> underwater footage and imaginative scenery really lift this film high above the normal standards of late 70's exploitation i don't quite understand why roger corman <UNK> the original so much and released it on the american market under a different title because there are very few elements open for improvement the cast members are all sergio martino <UNK> with the exception of the great joseph <UNK> is a neat supportive rule and give away great performances in case you can get your hands on the recently restored german version you're treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action see it
<START> <UNK> edge is more than just the story of a murder it's an <UNK> of the wave of <UNK> that has plagued <UNK> of youth for decades now our main characters are a group of what my high school would have referred to as <UNK> one of them just decided to <UNK> his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to talk sh t to him this dangerous young man played by daniel <UNK> has an intensity that will <UNK> you he takes the other kids in the group out to show them his <UNK> body and strangely enough nobody seems really freaked out about it the balance of the film <UNK> the desperate circumstances in which these people live and how guilt is eventually able to worm its way inside even these <UNK> kids br br <UNK> edge is certainly not <UNK> or <UNK> the behavior of its characters we clearly see the dangers presented by such <UNK> <UNK> and having only the desire to get drunk or high we are shown the dysfunctional home lives these kids have and perhaps this is meant to explain their awful behavior but could it only be unstable homes that lead to this type of destructive living <UNK> glover is his usual whacked out self he drives around town in a state of complete paranoia after the murder he tries to sympathize with why his friend had to commit the crime but clearly he does not understand what could have made the young man do it dennis hopper plays an older man these kids get their <UNK> from though he is certainly a rebellious figure he cannot relate to the <UNK> and rage of the younger generation witness his confused reaction as <UNK> describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel as wild as <UNK> character is even he knows this young man should not be walking the face of the earth br br what will you think of these kids well there is really no way to like their characters some are less despicable than others but you cannot help either hating or feeling sorry for them twenty years later there is still an <UNK> alive and well in a great many young people out there when do these kids get lost what makes so many of them want to act anti social this film and the questions it poses about teenagers will stick with you for a while that's a fact br br 8 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> i just saw everything is <UNK> at the film festival this is a truly remarkable film very emotional funny at times and heart warming bring your <UNK> for those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes i'm reminded of the endings of <UNK> feast and the <UNK> the stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes just as this film did br br no spoilers here the summary is as imdb describes a young man's journey to the <UNK> to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up br br the dialog is in english and <UNK> and russian too i believe this allows for some wonderfully <UNK> based moments as one character <UNK> more or less <UNK> for the english <UNK> in the group depending on the circumstances br br the scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful eastern european influences be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune br br this is directorial debut and is well done i give this film a 9 one of the best films i've seen in a long time i recommend it highly
<START> old ed was active back in the late 1950's he was <UNK> 16 november 1957 the <UNK> 24 police <UNK> was invented in 1974 yet the cops in the movie are all carrying the <UNK> 24 back then it would have been a standard billy club not the side handled <UNK> 24 <UNK> if you are gonna make movies do your research and get it right also it makes no mention of <UNK> usage of the bodies he <UNK> most of the <UNK> and made various <UNK> including a a belt and several masks he also had a large selection of <UNK> heads that several local children knew about as he often <UNK> for them he was found incompetent and committed to the central state hospital for the criminally insane
<START> there are <UNK> that a fourth underworld is going to happen if so than the third part which is also a prequel would be in the middle of the franchise with <UNK> that succeed the original movies you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies so that it makes sense br br in this case i guess it doesn't matter that much the third underworld movie isn't up to par with the other two they had their obvious flaws too but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in it seems like it's not going full <UNK> which is a shame because the actors sure could've used better material to work with br br the story is ok but it's nothing special a nice movie but couldn't fill the shoes of beckinsale yes she plays another character i mean the void that kate b left
<START> the film is a great watch very thoughtful i believe it is a film about how your like would be if you lived in a world created by <UNK> the scenes are all perfect <UNK> of an <UNK> <UNK> they even watch furniture on their tv when they break into the kitchen they break into another perfect picture of how a kitchen would look like in a <UNK> when he is <UNK> or whatever you would like to call it he returns to the harsh reality of life i love the bit when he tells his new love he has left his partner it <UNK> fun at commercial bliss by saying you can have it all and whilst it it is nice to have the same things but some things you do not want to share a film without children also per say makes for a perfect ten
<START> i've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film it seemed dull to me much as i enjoyed looking at penelope <UNK> and the plot details often poorly worked out it also seemed like an intensely sexist film if the gender roles were <UNK> almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely <UNK> it's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete <UNK> and sexual <UNK> but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless <UNK> a <UNK> community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless <UNK> and good humor are <UNK> dull and this one turns out to be no exception but it's also interesting to notice what happens and here comes the plot <UNK> though it refers to a very early scene when the teenage daughter kills her father 1 her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and 2 the daughter seems to suffer almost no <UNK> and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film it's not quite a <UNK> killing though camera <UNK> on the blood in a <UNK> way as though it makes an attractive painting and then it's <UNK> up and out of sight without <UNK> either daughter or mom neither <UNK> nor emotionally later the film reveals another killing again by a woman of a man and once again it is a killing which the film <UNK> <UNK> in short is an <UNK> driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a <UNK> ideology and so i write an <UNK> critique but apart from that it's just not very interesting it has none of the depth of say talk to her which i loved
<START> no serious spoilers but some very minor ones br br a korean contribution to the ever popular asian horror wave concerns a husband and wife who decide that they're getting on a bit and decide to adopt a child the child who has an usual obsession with the dead tree in the family's garden eventually disappears when the couple eventually have a child of their own and the aforementioned tree seems to hold a grudge against the family itself br br and that's about it the film moves at a <UNK> pace <UNK> in at over 100 minutes with 80 minute material it is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree and there is very little in the way of scares just shots of the tree with weird <UNK> noises playing over the top however the idea of the tree being the child's mother is a pretty original one but it isn't exactly exploited to its full potential this sort of <UNK> from much of the new wave it belongs to films like <UNK> on and ring tend to do the opposite and milk bland ideas until they are red in the face br br the film does begin to get going towards the end however the <UNK> of the child's fate and the <UNK> actions not only the earlier curiosity of the story but are revealed with such machine gun editing that it's difficult to take in all at once the final sequence is undoubtedly creepy however it feels like too little too late br br overall the film does not feel too much like a ring cash in however with the film renaissance that korea is currently going through i couldn't help but feel this film could have been so much more
<START> check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in we get a pretty good look at super secret los just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end wwii except for the tight security it looks <UNK> enough note how it's a tv <UNK> an obvious regular guy who takes us through security once through it's like any town usa nice homes quiet streets kids going to school and a family tv on the blink later on we see little tommy and little peggy <UNK> along streets <UNK> with impressive looking <UNK> separated by locked gates the movie appears to be saying okay we're tough only because we have to be but basically we're still just folks br br now i expect that was a <UNK> message to cold war audiences still not used to <UNK> <UNK> day research it's a clear effort at popular <UNK> the one darker note is when <UNK> mother clarke <UNK> about her son's mental state he doesn't say when i grow up instead it's if i grow up that note of doubt not only reflects a los reality but also a national one that in <UNK> had just seen footage of the apocalyptic h bomb note too how <UNK> fbi agents are portrayed a standard feature of mccarthy era fare when <UNK> force is needed it's not they but private citizen gene barry who <UNK> out the early version i suppose of modern era rendition br br once the kidnapping occurs the suspense doesn't let up the intrigue is nicely handled with colorful la locations that keep us guessing the climactic scenes around the cliff <UNK> may not be plausible as a hiding place but the view of northern new mexico is great then too the ancient stone apartments amount to one of the more exotic backdrops of the decade note also the extensive use of the police helicopter just coming into use as a law <UNK> tool among an otherwise subdued cast nancy gates remains a <UNK> presence as teacher ellen <UNK> never hollywood glamorous she was still a fine <UNK> actress and winning personality i also expect this was one of director <UNK> more successful movie efforts and though people have since gotten used to the nuclear threat the movie remains a revealing and riveting document of its time
<START> you don't have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this film i watched it for the first time when i was nine having been a fan of the t v show and my parents laughed just as hard as i did it is done in the classic style of bugs bunny cartoons from yesterday and considering todays vulgar cartoons i would think anybody would appreciate a cartoon movie that relies more on <UNK> then on <UNK> to get a few laughs
<START> this is a piece of hollywood product that should have never left a film can dialogue without a plausible thought plot without a point staging without skill directing without direction and acting without the worth of some <UNK> high <UNK> <UNK> class play the entire cast should have been arrested for over acting br br but otherwise okay
<START> in hoot <UNK> fingers is engaging in <UNK> to stop the <UNK> house the problem is that the <UNK> just start over again and he has to take more <UNK> <UNK> when he is confronted with the dogs he scares them off with snakes not before he is bitten by a dog and has to go to hospital br br roy at <UNK> asks his father who works with the department of justice how he deals with crooks his father says it involves the tedious steps of looking through papers because sooner or later they all slip up you can see this with <UNK> and roy looks at documents relating to the <UNK> house and finds a <UNK> document he does have to break in to the company trailer so when the police see it he has the law on his side unlike when he the police br br mind you as mentioned before roy is not always law <UNK> and when the company man is killing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fingers takes direct action he can't wait for the law <UNK> fingers is in hiding the movie does suggest that one should work in the system
<START> the plot of open graves is very simple it's about a board game called where the players die in real life the same way they die in the game laughable death scenes include killings via computer generated <UNK> and snakes the characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isn't even a tiny bit of suspense i liked <UNK> <UNK> in wrong turn but she is completely wasted and <UNK> here the climax with cgi witch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupid the only reason to see open graves are some interesting camera angles plus sexy <UNK> <UNK> if such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give up give me any 70's or 80's low budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap a generous 3 out of 10
<START> <UNK> like many other horror films gets a raw deal on imdb the majority of movie <UNK> have a <UNK> contempt for horror and when they occasionally rent horror films they either want to laugh at them or cringe at <UNK> gory scenes unfortunately <UNK> is not particularly laughable and not that bloody so it gets a low rating that's too bad br br of course there's plenty to criticize here the non actors are flat the <UNK> are a poor special effect and the <UNK> scenes are too <UNK> lit but what do you expect for a straight to video horror film <UNK> boasts decent production values and more integrity than you might <UNK> the film's romanian setting is virtually unique i believe it was the first american movie made in that country post communism and the locations both interior and exterior are beautiful the script has moments of intelligence especially when it <UNK> into local <UNK> all bogus i'm sure somehow the location filming and script work well together <UNK> has its own very distinctive world to risk <UNK> with faint praise it could be a lot dumber br br fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will no doubt get a kick out of the blood <UNK> vampire villain he's pretty effective in this movie powerful with a memorable <UNK> voice but i like him better in the sequels when actor <UNK> gives a more self <UNK> campy performance a totally sincere is somewhat silly other silly aspects include gratuitous nudity and the <UNK> themselves who are clearly only in the movie because producer charles band has a fetish for evil little creatures see also <UNK> and demonic toys br br but i <UNK> too much on the movie's flaws for what it is straight to video vampire horror <UNK> is perfectly fine the sequels <UNK> better production values more violence and somewhat more thoughtful story lines so i recommend them even more highly still this isn't a bad start for the series
<START> how do you make a totally unappealing movie out of a story by one of america's most famous authors watch this film and find out maybe i am author carson <UNK> but i was impressed by the heart is a lonely hunter and was hoping for something memorable here too forget it br br vanessa redgrave looks like a man with her short <UNK> and clothing i never found her much to get excited about in almost any movie anyway rod <UNK> as a preacher how insulting is that unlikable characters one after the other well maybe that's the book too and i am being unfair to this film i am not familiar with the story other than what i saw on screen and this was so unappealing a movie that i could never recommend it to anyone br br it's just one backwards person after another in a <UNK> town outside of some nice cinematography here and there there is nothing to recommend how anyone could sit through 100 minutes of this is amazing br br i didn't even go into how bad this is directed there is good news this was the only film simon directed
<START> in the <UNK> mid 70's a <UNK> bunch of <UNK> young <UNK> california <UNK> from broken homes and the bad side of town known as the z boys turned the previously <UNK> world of professional <UNK> on its ear with their fierce punk attitude radical unconventional riding style and <UNK> spirit of pure in your face <UNK> the sport in the process and <UNK> the way for the many extreme variations on sports that popped up in their influential wake director <UNK> <UNK> who's one of the legendary z boys himself relates the incredible exploits of this amazing <UNK> crew in a <UNK> <UNK> and visceral manner that's both informative and wildly entertaining the snappy rapid fire editing <UNK> <UNK> pace and raw gritty photography deliver one hell of an <UNK> <UNK> buzz <UNK> a sense of sheer joy and full on <UNK> energy that's a total pleasure to behold better still this documentary neither <UNK> nor its subjects these <UNK> were so <UNK> <UNK> and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune <UNK> in their lives the ultimate <UNK> of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking with gifted and spontaneous ace <UNK> rat jay adams rating as the saddest and most tragic he blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail the other <UNK> are very colorful and <UNK> as well charismatic ball of cocky and <UNK> fire tony in particular comes across as one arrogant yet impressive piece of <UNK> <UNK> work <UNK> narrated with delightfully <UNK> <UNK> by sean penn the terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously <UNK> but what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing complete <UNK> of <UNK> it's every bit as dynamic <UNK> and larger than life extraordinary as the <UNK> outrageous z boys themselves
<START> it's out of question that the real anna anderson was not princess <UNK> apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance <UNK> eyes are larger lips <UNK> nose larger and turned up at the end etc <UNK> unable to speak russian was a ridiculous tell that's why i <UNK> anna anderson and her <UNK> so much not a lot of <UNK> have the <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> for 60 years with such a blatantly <UNK> scheme br br yet to some extent i have sympathy for anna anderson life must have been hard for a young polish <UNK> worker in those days and to <UNK> another woman for 60 years is an <UNK> task for anybody she had to hold back her <UNK> lips all the time to <UNK> the thin lips of and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problem br br anna anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track had she put her good looks learned <UNK> <UNK> acting skills into proper use she could of made a first class actress br br on a side note some main characters of this two <UNK> seem to be loosely based on real figures prince <UNK> could be a mixture of <UNK> believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme duke george and of and several other figures and seem to be based on the gorgeous princess but unlike the real <UNK> prince <UNK> was <UNK> in this show and supported anna out of love for and sincere belief in her which is touching br br on the whole this is a great show <UNK> a bit but still remains faithful to the reality the power of amy <UNK> acting lies in that she successfully represented <UNK> self <UNK> the mixture of <UNK> others and being herself is intriguing just as princess said about anderson she was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part highly recommended
<START> there are actually some good reasons why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show the breasts are nice even though some of them aren't that real but they usually come in <UNK> which is good watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark it's always good to remember that david <UNK> is a god not the god but a god it's not so much about his acting skills since there are none but his does a lot of talking also there's no <UNK> hanging out in this series which is good since mr <UNK> told in an interview that he always thought <UNK> was gay naturally that might make him to look like an idiot but considering the other statements he has made lately it shouldn't be surprising to anyone br br in a nutshell this is the kind of show that is totally harmless to people it gives us a lot to stare at and a lot to laugh at which is something many intentionally <UNK> shows really don't give us i have to say it's no wonder that <UNK> fell in love with pamela anderson i enjoy watching the show no it's not a great show actually it's quite horrible but i enjoy watching it it's basically like a b movie stretched to last for a decade
<START> for his last film john huston directed his daughter <UNK> in this adaptation of the story from james <UNK> <UNK> and he gave us one of his finest achievements to remember him by br br <UNK> is about as impossible to film as anyone but the dead at least presents a traditional narrative to work with much indeed almost all of the important information in the story lies in the spaces between the lines in characters' thoughts and expressions there are big moments but they're cerebral they're not the stuff of which movies are made but somehow huston gets it right and he manages a nearly flawless adaptation br br <UNK> is magnificent and the movie is haunting and powerful br br grade a
<START> this was a very good show i enjoyed the construction of real time and flashback seeing the old <UNK> meeting again and <UNK> the <UNK> of their <UNK> in <UNK> camp the main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in are more like a holiday camp than what the place must have been like i am old enough to remember film footage of the men being <UNK> from and other japanese <UNK> camps no actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance of the state of those men they made the jews of look like <UNK> <UNK> i have met several veterans from over the years many would never ride in a japanese car let alone own one the physical and mental torture those men endured was too horrific for them to even talk about what <UNK> survived john doyle might be ok writing comedy for roy and <UNK> i hate that too but this is a serious sugar <UNK> of history that should never have been <UNK> i'm happy for to write the life of brian and make fun of the <UNK> because it is obviously comedy even if some consider it to be in bad taste is written as a portrayal of a real event and as such might be regarded by younger people as a true record great performances by a fine cast cannot redeem this lightweight screenplay
<START> if this awful film moved at a <UNK> pace it would at least be moving watching grass grow would be more interesting it was painful to sit through and i only stayed in the theatre to see how all the cruel teens would die where is brian <UNK>
<START> <UNK> the title for the <UNK> film ever made pink <UNK> is an <UNK> classic sure the <UNK> is shaky and off center the story is muddled and slow paced and every single character in the movie is <UNK> and despicable but pink <UNK> has a certain playful charm and brilliant <UNK> wit that no other movie can match br br while this film is indeed an offensive one reading <UNK> of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it only john waters can succeed in making rape murder <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and just about every other form of human <UNK> known to man seem absolutely hilarious this movie must be seen to be believed
<START> this film is a classic seventies cop flick that for some reason has been sadly overlooked it is basically french connection meets <UNK> br br roy <UNK> plays the head of an elite group of detectives known as the seven ups br br one of their men is discovered during an undercover <UNK> and is killed br br <UNK> and his team must find his killers they become involved in a battle with the mob br br the highlight of the film has to be the car chase obviously included to cash in on the success of <UNK> however this car chase <UNK> <UNK> due to its length speed and sheer excitement it's a breathtaking roller coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and spectacularly don't miss this little gem
<START> there's nothing particularly unique or interesting about this run of the mill low budget sci fi flick regardless of its origin the film is loosely based on a novel by leo <UNK> the plot and overall themes of this film are in no way remarkable or original the science is weak at best and unfortunately the film fails to even involve compelling action sequences br br the plot begins with a <UNK> space flight to mars and though the main plot doesn't really get rolling until the ship lands most of the most interesting scenes occur en route unfortunately as soon as our <UNK> <UNK> touch down their previously interesting <UNK> relationships <UNK> about and the meaning of life and everything interesting about the film all give way to an only remotely coherent plot concerning martian <UNK> <UNK> problems and not very convincing <UNK> of <UNK> br br there is nothing very remarkable about the production quality of the film either it's passable and most of the acting is though slow ok cameron mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a likable character i guess the best quality of this film from my perspective is its fashion sense the martians have very nice outfits if this film had a point it might have been much more interesting oh well
<START> although this small film kind of got lost in the wake of on the <UNK> edge of the city can certainly hold its own with that star <UNK> classic it's another story about the <UNK> and the code of silence that rules it br br next to the corrupt union that lee j <UNK> ran in on the <UNK> jack warden is really small time corruption but he's real enough as the gang boss on one of the <UNK> who <UNK> the other workers by being handy with his <UNK> and the hook and he gets the rest to part of their hard earned money and it's all hard earned money in that job br br one guy warden can't <UNK> is sidney <UNK> another gang boss and when he tries to <UNK> newcomer john cassavetes <UNK> takes him under his wing the two develop quite the friendship and <UNK> and his wife ruby dee even fix cassavetes up with kathleen maguire br br warden is truly one <UNK> creature and it's sad how by sheer force of personality and physical <UNK> he <UNK> almost everyone else into <UNK> in that sense he's <UNK> than lee j <UNK> who did have to rely on an impression collection of <UNK> to <UNK> his will in on the <UNK> br br edge of the city marked the big screen directorial debut of martin <UNK> who did a great job with a good cast of new york based players and spot on location cinematography the film's low budget does show but you're so impressed with the ensemble cast you don't really care br br cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hip and tough <UNK> are both fine but my personal favorite in this film is ruby dee she should have gotten some award for her performance her final scene with cassavetes is outstanding br br catch this one if ever possible i wish it were out on dvd or vhs
<START> i saw this film a week ago and i had to <UNK> my friend to come with me because this film seems to be getting such bad reviews sure it is no <UNK> or <UNK> stock ' but is by no means a flop i think the fact that there are so many big budget films out at the moment means it has been ignored but it shouldn't be i <UNK> it sets out to do what it wants to do entertain us for an hour and a half and leave us feeling happy and <UNK> i would much rather go and see it that 'the which looks boring and no i'm not a teenager don't listen to the critics star wars fans didn't this film is well worth seeing if just to see the gorgeous luke de <UNK> and rupert <UNK> jones go see it
<START> leslie <UNK> hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that i have ever seen there is nothing to like about this film as it is essentially a one joke film and the joke isn't all that funny how many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself that's not funny that's just pitiful <UNK> seriously needs to start <UNK> some of these pathetic scripts and stanley <UNK> needs to stick to making jackie chan films because it doesn't get much worse than this
<START> what a terrible movie the acting in this film is about the quality of a high school play or a story driven pornography film this is not pornography in this film but there sure is a lot of gratuitous nudity this is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film one of the only things that saved it from receiving a rating on one star also there are a million cops that die in this film hardly offensive though since the violence is so unrealistic we can only laugh but breasts pop out and become exposed in the most surprising and hilarious times if you enjoy really really bad movies check this one out this is a bonnie and clyde type story where a mother and her two daughters are out for revenge this film also features a sex scene with two of the oldest people i have ever seen rolling around naked
<START> this movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck <UNK> all racial and ethnic <UNK> ultimately the market place <UNK> the message that is sent to the public this movie <UNK> that point a conservative white collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street wise african americans by a no nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth but the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different the market place and the political system demands that he <UNK> rendering him no different than his predecessors interesting off beat movie
<START> i own a vacation lake home not far from <UNK> ten minutes from the <UNK> property to be exact i've seen his land the cemetery where he is buried and where he did his digging and i've <UNK> at the <UNK> store that was <UNK> owned by the <UNK> family while visiting relatives in california we decided to rent this movie it was disgusting the true story of ed <UNK> is so disturbing and creepy why the creators of this piece of trash decided to make up their own story is beyond me the actor playing ed is a very large man ed was a very small meek and shy man that is part of what makes his story so frightening he did not have a <UNK> to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with a little dirt in it you won't break much of a sweat digging a hole they didn't have to hire an actor with the <UNK> of a wrestler just do your research and if the writing wasn't bad enough there are no mountains in <UNK> and i'm pretty certain that <UNK> was not available in 1957
<START> <UNK> hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes <UNK> with positive thinking and is thought by the local folk to be a witch kate works overly hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods <UNK> named trigger <UNK> but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario constantly smiling robert young plays a <UNK> working on the construction of a mountain <UNK> who becomes first crush but alas he's married no amount of white magic can <UNK> this formula based on a play and brought to the screen by r k o with too broad a <UNK> <UNK> it is <UNK> and just about unwatchable 1 2 from
<START> the movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the stooges the story is told from the point of view of moe howard and his relationships with his brothers <UNK> and <UNK> curly howard also the life long friendship with larry fine the movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the stooges multi decade career the casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who <UNK> the famous ensemble the actor who plays curly howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved <UNK> a must see for any fan of three stooges shorts
<START> following the <UNK> success of the wrestler see my review mickey rourke had this gem head straight to video every copy was rented for months and i even heard some good buzz around it so months later i caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it first of all one of the locations in the film island is a place i used to visit on a regular basis as a child because we lived very very close to the <UNK> cool huh that's about where the <UNK> ends with this dud i mean the story is decent enough to warrant a four and even the direction is not bad but the performances are just awful and downright ridiculous with some truly wasted star power and mickey rourke playing a native canadian american hit man what in the <UNK> name were they thinking he doesn't even resemble native blood and his attempt at the generic native accent made him look even more ridiculous they could have went anywhere with this story they could have hired a native actor or changed <UNK> character how about a white man raised by native parents instead they made <UNK> a complete and utter joke br br as you may have caught mickey rourke stars in <UNK> i use that term loosely i have never liked rourke much although his oscar winning performance was decent enough this shows and <UNK> my dislike for him he looks bored constantly bored and his lame attempt at portraying a native is <UNK> on insulting i would think he makes a decent cold blooded killer but then the story never explores that part of him which is totally backwards to the story diane lane although well respected in hollywood turns in another drab performance she has had her moments but overall she just usually doesn't take off in any one performance she looks like she is going to be great but then when she isn't its even more disappointing thomas jane plays her protective husband i've always felt jane deserves a bigger career than he has i think he's got action star in his blood all said and done his performance in <UNK> is actually not bad he doesn't take things too far and he's tough and almost heroic in a way him and lane manage to have decent chemistry but he doesn't get a lot in the way of his character i have absolutely no idea why rosario dawson a did this movie and b had a character at all her character is absolutely useless and had no point to the plot or story making any performance she would give equally as bad i have rarely seen a character who is supporting so incredibly useless the only redeeming character and performance in this film is that given by joseph gordon <UNK> as the deranged mini killer who wants to team up with <UNK> hit man gordon <UNK> is over the top crazy and entertaining and his character is actually engaging if this film had been entirely about him it would have been a smash he literally saves this from utter crap his performance is almost worth watching this drivel for br br oscar nominated director <UNK> wait yes oscar nominated director john <UNK> i think the football coach could have done a better job <UNK> this mess i have actually never seen shakespeare in love but i remember the critical acclaim it received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright awful screenplay writer <UNK> has done nothing i recognize but apparently has been <UNK> to write the next jack ryan movie and after this mess i can't even imagine why they'd want him i understand this is based on a novel and i really hope the novel is worlds above this mess a little bit of action and some sort of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a hit man and his partner and the mess they get involved in unfortunately unless you're a huge rourke fan or really love joseph gordon <UNK> then there is no reason to put yourself through this pain i did it for you and i still feel the pain 4 10
<START> this film was incredible looked high budget but felt heartfelt and original like an indie the most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by david mark <UNK> and paul anthony who plays the main role he carried this film with ease humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth br br the cinematography was really beautiful even though some of the subject was quite ugly it wasn't very realistic in that way but it didn't have to be to make a larger point it was really great seeing alan <UNK> in this too the script was tight and <UNK> very nicely with some of the best acting i've seen in a while br br go see this
<START> i find it hard to believe this could happen at all we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble so the first crime they commit is murder just to play and <UNK> with the cops how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it also richard seems to <UNK> the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle hmmm this whole concept is really hard to believe that said let's move on i found myself really hating these <UNK> and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police <UNK> <UNK> and see what their plastic suits do then as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess sandra does a superb acting job she sure made me believe she was one angry cop as for solving the crime i thought it was great this movie kept me planted in my chair loved the acting of all but sam he had no get up and go the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene
<START> i too must apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this <UNK> as i contributed to the soundtrack still i received my copy sat back and enjoyed the rolling cast of characters who were perhaps more colorful than the characters they were creating in this tale of a film sequel shanghai for those who feel george bush is a credible <UNK> one need look no further than this film to <UNK> the image that texas is full of truck driving one dimensional <UNK> the cast contains some of the most intelligent peculiar and humorous folks you'll find anywhere as they spin their tales of agony bliss and disappointment in going for a great film sequel no budget <UNK> style i e punk rock style as each person helps define br br this is a great documentary made with passion and guts and all the <UNK> you'll need to break through to the other side of whatever industry b s and you're dealing with take note authors <UNK> musicians and fellow filmmakers it <UNK> back to the credibility of the first wave of american hardcore music when the term d i y was the standard a period where courage passion and commitment <UNK> way more than technique style or precious <UNK> not that there isn't plenty of technique or style to this the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing the editing cuts provide as much drama as the dialog <UNK> br br the idea of creating a documentary out of the sad demise of the cast crew and director's initial intent is brilliant totally texas and absolutely punk rock in the <UNK> sense of the term
<START> this movie is exactly the same as <UNK> scott's someone to watch over me which is a classic it stars tom berenger and <UNK> rogers and the bad guy from the fugitive it's a quality movie with good direction and great acting this movie is the polar opposite it's the same plot just minus any good acting and adding tv movie direction i do have to say i like the interaction between lowe and the woman she's hot and their romance is believable on many levels unfortunately that alone cannot save this <UNK> copy of the classic <UNK> scott film br br usually crappy tv movies have some redeeming quality that makes them watchable at the very least i think for me this film's redeeming value is that rob lowe and the lead female have chemistry that and i was able to watch and compare the plot to another quality film
<START> this movie was in one word terrible it was boring predictable and downright creepy i kept waiting for it to end and when it did i was horrified the ending left a bad taste in my mouth to say the least my advice to anyone interested in movies about budding female sexuality stay away from this movie movies like this give classics like <UNK> a bad name
<START> for a really wonderful movie you could also try seeing the movie about saint francis of good for any audience best thing i liked about this movie was the mexico landscape it gets the movie up to a 2 i was surprised that these actors didn't have terrible <UNK> they were so were not desert <UNK> and <UNK> is said to have a speaking <UNK> but certainly not here even the miracle scenes were contrived un believable and what's the point if you can belief anything in a tv story talk about <UNK> down i thought this hallmark made movie was pathetic i can see why others hate hollywood i don't just some of these corporate profit you don't have to be any kind of religious to benefit from jesus of <UNK> but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored with nothing to do <UNK> down religious and for a real movie experience try short cut to <UNK> a very highly rated film
<START> wow i can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie br br although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt <UNK> granted most people probably either think he's too <UNK> happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in <UNK> punk another great <UNK> film br br <UNK> this is <UNK> your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything which start to amount to <UNK> also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent <UNK> a very under appreciated person in the film industry the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene br br it's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to <UNK> the <UNK> but share with no one they all try to get <UNK> to kill off the other and it's a <UNK> waiting to explode matt shows his true <UNK> as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business <UNK> character is a bit deranged and <UNK> throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film br br the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies <UNK> probably won't like this movie but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway
<START> my wife and i watched this after it off of <UNK> action this past week it has to be the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen predictable dialogue my wife and i were guessing the lines before they were spoken hokey special effects a screenplay that <UNK> all over the place i think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between two of the young <UNK> in the movie neither of which had any real purpose other than to bare certain parts of their <UNK> for the cameras this movie should be <UNK> as comedy not horror as the villains of the movie <UNK> were stop motion animated and not believable in the least i can't say that i would have done a better job making a film myself but it was very amateurish and wasn't even a b movie somewhere closer to a d movie or f if that is possible i think even science fiction 3000 would have to pass on this one
<START> overall this is a pretty bad film but for 5 at it wasn't a total waste br br the whole scenario has to do with a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes supposedly from a magic curse the actors actresses aren't names that are big even though some look like from tv shows so i won't do my usual <UNK> <UNK> thing br br for awhile the film holds your interest as the couple hop a train and travel to l a to see a <UNK> to <UNK> the curse there's a bit of other plots going on too like two ladies <UNK> drugs br br but the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total let down as violent and gory as the whole film is the grand finale is just totally computer animated br br i saw the <UNK> version which had tons of language gore blood violence everything the bonus features were ok br br overall grade d
<START> a criminally short lived show that went on to <UNK> three movie spin offs naked gun 1 2 3 this is fast paced in your face rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses br br leslie <UNK> plays detective lieutenant sergeant frank an incompetent detective who <UNK> and <UNK> his way through cases with the capable assistant of his boss capt ed br br the story lines are <UNK> at best but it's deliberate as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling but in the <UNK> of a constant <UNK> of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters br br the jokes themselves come in many forms be it <UNK> slapstick <UNK> or background gags most of them hitting the spot though some fall a little flat it's inevitable with this every few <UNK> approach that some will fail but the ratio is good br br the characters are a delight from the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of every episode the laboratory scientist who appears to be <UNK> cruel and unusual experiments on children to the shoe shine who is some form of <UNK> the writing is witty and sharp as a br br though not especially successful at the time it rapidly developed a cult following many <UNK> the <UNK> relative lack of success on being way ahead of its time and too sophisticated for the target audience chief amongst them none other than matt 'the <UNK> <UNK> and he should know br br dated by todays standards if you can see through that aspect you're in for a treat
<START> sweeping drama with great sets costumes and performances  though some folks are <UNK> <UNK> scarlett <UNK> and even lady <UNK> patrick <UNK> and james read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad secondary story lines also are well developed several cameos by major stars of past <UNK> good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics br br <UNK> up on a rainy day with your dvd or vhs player and drink of choice with this one a lap <UNK> and a cat would be <UNK>
<START> this was a great film in every sense of the word it <UNK> the subject of in a society that is quite <UNK> of any <UNK> from the norm it <UNK> a great many indian customs that many find oppressive such as the <UNK> of <UNK> by others the importance of status and face religious <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of women in terms of their baby making capacity the <UNK> concepts of duty and so on at the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves the film is well acted and genuine completely believable from beginning to end unlike most bollywood flicks the main faults of the film as i saw it was first that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural <UNK> for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead end <UNK> with no passion and no <UNK> this may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters but most people stuck in the same situation will not turn homosexual it seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite <UNK> when <UNK> does her scene at the end of the movie with she makes it quite clear that without desire she was dead and the <UNK> was that if he had desired so he could have <UNK> her quite completely and also when <UNK> seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her such situations do not turn people into <UNK> they may seek comfort in others in the same position but film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning quite the opposite some people are <UNK> it is true but most tend to be either <UNK> or homosexual in the case of the ladies in the film both had <UNK> <UNK> for husbands if this had not been the case would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered the film ignores this the other fault is the <UNK> of the characters the names <UNK> and <UNK> seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage imagine a film in america depicting a gay relationship between a man named jesus and another named paul by using names associated with various <UNK> the film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion at any rate the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie it is indeed a very touching and powerful story the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre
<START> could this be one of the earliest colour films it's actually the second this is a very beautiful piece of film produced by thomas edison this was one of many of his other films br br i think this is the most beautiful of any thomas edison films it shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around which turns red with the film it's just beautiful br br you are watching history when you watch this you are watching what began to make movies of the day great this may not have a plot or anything very interesting but this is the second colour film ever br br i recommend this to everyone especially if you're teaching students about filming or something of the sort you have to show them what began color films
<START> this movie is not a comedy it is not even funny in the this movie is so bad it's funny department rather it is just plain bad other reviewers mention the bad lighting but beyond that is the abundance of bad plastic surgery br br meanwhile a lot of great acting talent was wasted on a poor screenplay and uninspired direction the main characters are one dimensional and boring it is hard to feel sympathy for any of them it is also hard to see the four characters as close friends it seems like just a bunch of women thrown together pretending to be close br br i won't list all of the problems with this movie as it doesn't merit that much of anyone's attention nor is it worth the time it takes to watch it
<START> i bought this video on a throw out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was <UNK> as an award winning brit sex comedy i guess i should have read the <UNK> print i rarely write a <UNK> review but here goes br br these actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors the theatre going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their <UNK> br br i repeat is the joke about <UNK> the actors' other highly respectable on screen <UNK> with this trashy flick can the reference to the austen classics <UNK> and and <UNK> and <UNK> be anything else how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars are we meant to simply take it as a lay down that all actors are gay and thus letting their on screen affect our <UNK> is accepting their private homosexual <UNK> in our faces too i'm sorry but i don't think so i say no to this one
<START> i'm not a massive disney fan but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them so we've built up quite a collection and this is one of my favourites we first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since ok as others have pointed out not the most complex or inventive of plots but there's more to a film than that br br great characters phil harris stealing the show as thomas but edgar the butler not far behind the music is superb my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to everybody wants to be cat this says it all and thomas is just as enjoyable br br i'm not sure why some people have such a <UNK> on this film other than a dislike of cats and yes it does take a few of its <UNK> from 101 <UNK> and maybe the lady and the tramp it's been a long time since i've seen that so i'm not going to compare them and while 101 <UNK> is better in some ways for me the <UNK> is far more enjoyable isn't that what these films are about br br apart from peter pan now that is a 10 10 film this is my favourite disney film my 7 year old son loves it his grumpy <UNK> year old dad loves it so you can't ask much more of a family film br br superb
<START> colonel <UNK> is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen i have seen in the movies it combines the realism of french cinema with excellent characterisation from <UNK> lost <UNK> to proud lawyer to <UNK> complex widow the movie has wonderful dimension as you might expect from a top cinematographer such as <UNK> <UNK> the characters keep this movie in gear and although a bit slow in the beginning picks up pace and is a fine movie by the time it reaches the finish
<START> this appears to be two movies spliced into one in the first <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> in a small town she wants to help the romantic life of <UNK> ok i'd never heard of her before either but she and <UNK> are in both parts of this <UNK> br br before we know it <UNK> is no longer miss polly she is i had to <UNK> to see if i'd fallen asleep somewhere i hadn't she no longer in a small town but on her way to the title honeymoon destination br br the movie has some cute moments the first part is better with roles for what seems to be every third rate character actress working in hollywood at the time br br and what of ms she sounds a little like betty <UNK> she sounds a little like marie wilson she's pretty certainly but she's no <UNK> br br <UNK> often was used in very small roles here she has the largest role she's always fun though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesn't go quite a long way as a comic when she was a tragic actress in von <UNK> <UNK> the wedding march and greed are the two i have seen she was brilliant
<START> i have read each and every one of <UNK> scarlet <UNK> books counting this one i have seen 3 <UNK> movies the one with jane seymour and anthony andrews i preferred greatly to this it goes out of its way for violence and action occasionally completely <UNK> the spirit of the book i don't expect movies to stick directly to plots i gave up being that idealistic long ago but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes but a barely decent script sticking with the 80's version
<START> unusually cold and silly drama from director sydney <UNK> <UNK> plot revolves around <UNK> couple <UNK> in a plane wreck leaving their <UNK> to find <UNK> and connect on their own intimate level romance novel writing gets <UNK> treatment although i thought the performances by leads harrison ford and <UNK> scott thomas were fine slick production holds interest even though the plot keeps covering the same ground and never builds any emotional momentum as a result the climax in the airport is a big <UNK> what '
<START> a lot of my childhood was spent lying in front of the <UNK> listening to round the <UNK> or <UNK> half hour or watching carry on films probably the most famous line in comedy <UNK> <UNK> they've all got it <UNK> still makes me laugh br br this is a rare insight into the man behind the comic figure and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy right down to the final <UNK> from the <UNK> court read in four different voices by michael sheen he was brilliant in the role most of the other members of the carry on team were so so and their kenneth <UNK> was very good but michael sheen carried the show and there should be an award of some sort for him br br it left me feeling wow to quote kenneth williams to the <UNK> who says <UNK> is a <UNK> the only response can be <UNK> well let's make it a good one '
<START> this is one of my favourite comedy films chris <UNK> is hilarious as the accident prone moron and david spade is perfect playing the straight man to <UNK> br br the dialogue between the two of them is brilliant the scene where the two of them are in the car singing along to superstar by the <UNK> is a classic br br chris <UNK> was a great comic actor who had amazing potential he will be sadly missed br br
<START> when john carpenter's <UNK> version of the thing was released in summer 1982 it was <UNK> by critics and bombed at the box office the audiences couldn't handle another <UNK> alien they wanted et their loss in the long run br br i would kill to be able to see this great movie on the big screen this is a movie that was way ahead of it's time now it has influenced a new generation of filmmakers showing it's trail on things like <UNK> alien 3 and even the x files which <UNK> ripped it off page by page and the structure which <UNK> character development in favour of incredible <UNK> is <UNK> in today's blockbuster flicks br br carpenter shows the same skills he <UNK> in halloween using the camera to create an unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere the performances are all fine and the ending is terrific still unique today br br a paranoid masterpiece
<START> this was a sleeper for sure much better than i thought never realizing it was a horror flick and who was this gorgeous voiced hunk named <UNK> <UNK> adding spice and intrigue to this otherwise film the monsters in this film were quite unusual not the same <UNK> run of the mill <UNK> you up types the ending was great too for a change not all bad guys are bad i give it 2 thumbs up
<START> i know that guts of a beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many but i'm gonna put myself under the bus here and say i like 'em especially guts of a beauty aka <UNK> of a beautiful woman watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and i was surprised how well it actually went over br br <UNK> is the type of <UNK> <UNK> horror <UNK> sleaze epic that you really just don't find too much of outside of asia specifically japan in this case it's basically a rape revenge flick with a <UNK> monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or even a <UNK> off daddy with a chainsaw that <UNK> just silly wouldn't you rather see a monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a br br <UNK> factor this movie is high in graphic sometimes wacky rape sequences fake pop shots and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that you <UNK> like if you like corman <UNK> like <UNK> from the deep i <UNK> maybe that's a stretch but i personally didn't think <UNK> of a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and <UNK> b <UNK> br br yeah i know sometimes some of my <UNK> are not always everyone's <UNK> tea even for those of you who like the same kind of garbage as i do but i stand behind this one 8 10
<START> my girlfriend wanted to see this lol this is the case a lot so i rented it then i saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 oscars great this should be good ol' drama this movie had a lot of potential the direction and the way everything was paced was very well but once the movie ended i couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for virginia hill <UNK> <UNK> was extremely annoying i just couldn't tolerate her character at all warren beatty was excellent in the film acting wise but again i just found it hard to have sympathy for his character he just came off essentially as a idiotic loser of a gangster who had no place in 'the <UNK> in the first place <UNK> he get in with the likes of meyer <UNK> and lucky <UNK> anyway this film just left me with a bland but uneasy feeling what was the big deal with this movie i just didn't feel a <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> antics although acted quite well just seemed too random and illogical i'm guessing that's how <UNK> really was but it was just too much of that there just didn't seem to be much of a real story here my basic <UNK> of it would be br br a hot headed playboy <UNK> gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman comes up with the idea of <UNK> <UNK> but his failed attempt at the casino he builds along with having no regard for his mob <UNK> money gets him killed br br what else is there besides that i just didn't see the big deal with this and it was a big disappointment there must've not been many movies to come out in 1991 how this was nominated for 10 oscars is beyond me although the two it won is <UNK> 1 5 4 stars
<START> i'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established however watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a shelley hack reference while on the phone we sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix we can only assume he had a charlie's angels <UNK> at one time based on that reference we assumed this film must have been made around her charlie's angels run in 1979 or 1980 but from what i've read here it was made around 1987 you sure couldn't tell that from the poor production values it seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class and while by no means would i expect a low budget trash fest like this to be politically correct the <UNK> in this film sure did like to direct <UNK> gay remarks to each other even so i'd still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made second only to nail gun massacre
<START> after reading previews for this movie i thought it would be a let down however after i got my region 1 dvd the dvd was available before the film hit the uk cinemas i was pleasantly surprised strong performances from all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie the fact that the script is quite weak means that you dont get <UNK> down in story and therefore the repeat viewing factor is greater i recommend this movie to one and all br br
<START> beyond the clouds is an over the top artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a man woman relationship from the <UNK> to the <UNK> although the film offers superb cinematography some exquisite visual beauty and a cast of fine performers there's little meat on the bones of this <UNK> work a taste of a relationship cannot <UNK> the <UNK> of it and suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in 2 hours than with four nonetheless beyond the clouds will be fodder for and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial stilted and lacking in substance
<START> i wasn't sure on what to expect from the box i am a huge fan of <UNK> but also saw the mess that became of tales whether or not that was a studio <UNK> up who knows with the box i was pleasantly surprised it was a <UNK> to classic sci fi paranoia films that hint at much larger <UNK> happenings but center on an intimate character base br br the slow build and creepy tension was very effective to the tone and theme of the entire film any change in such pacing would have lead to the typical hollywood or style that just wouldn't have served this story's purpose correctly everything from the strange looking acting extras <UNK> throughout to the low end score to the minimal explanation of what exactly was going on added an entire focused thread of underlying dread and the <UNK> sense of hope for our greedy though well meaning lead characters this was something well thought out and put into motion by richard kelly from the first act through to the end richard <UNK> short story which this was based on not the twilight zone <UNK> which was another take on the story was one of morality and greed which were still the central elements of the box being only some 8 long <UNK> it into a feature with substance would have been no easy task but was done so with style originality and leaves the viewer with lingering thoughts about the film many have and will compare this to <UNK> for whether or not it is as profound but i found it to be an entirely different film <UNK> and emotionally it's tone is completely different as are the messages and <UNK> of this film where <UNK> left us with questions <UNK> the box leaves the viewer with more <UNK> questions involving the world around us such as knowing human nature would the test of the box ever come to an end decent acting great creepy visuals and <UNK> atmosphere add to the slow chilling ride its not for everyone but for those who get where its coming from its a treat
<START> this is not your typical indian film there is some great sense of humanity and the characters are pretty realistic there is great <UNK> in the <UNK> relationships and there is a sense of guilt grief passion <UNK> among the many characters while seeing this one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the <UNK> years of layers and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest <UNK> the final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great <UNK> to such a ancient civilization and yet human relations are still <UNK> and <UNK> saw it on dvd the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well or not being shown in india but maybe not too surprised the artistic of rural societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations as some of the older musicians in the movie are no longer living today great film
<START> it's rare for a film to <UNK> you away within its world and leave you wanting more once the credits roll <UNK> miyazaki's is such a film br br the film is the story of a young <UNK> named who wishes to become human she <UNK> to shore and is found by a young boy named who promises to take care of her course father an <UNK> obsessed <UNK> named <UNK> tries to keep from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature which is eventually when finally transforms into a little girl causing a massive <UNK> br br is a very rich film it is full of wondrous fantasy lovable characters and genuine heart what director <UNK> miyazaki has done here is tell a simple little story and while so doing creating authentic movie magic br br is an enchanting experience the love between and is very pure and true as well the <UNK> within miyazaki is still as evident within this film as in all his previous works miyazaki shows the filth and <UNK> that fall into the ocean in an almost startling light not to mention father is on an obsessive mission to clean the world's <UNK> while the story is simple miyazaki manages to add this extra <UNK> to <UNK> thought with expert <UNK> br br the film is a beautiful work of art each hand drawn cell looks like a wondrous <UNK> painting the film looks very different than many other studio <UNK> productions but the artistry is still just as spectacular as ever before the scenes underwater are simply beautiful to watch <UNK> <UNK> under the sea is highly inventive and the sequence where runs across the jumping fish within the <UNK> to reach is iconic br br course it is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that makes this film such a memorable experience is a young boy who acts older than he actually is and the energetic is a laugh a minute every character is just so enjoyable and highly memorable br br overall is a wondrous experience enchanting in every single way while the film may be sold as a children's fairy tale i believe many adults will be swept away within its fantastic world along with their children while the film may lack the <UNK> of some of miyazaki's previous works here he keeps it pure and simple being true to himself delivering a film that is funny heartwarming and entertaining all in one this is a magnificent film br br i give a perfect 10 out of 10
<START> yesterday as a movie is hard to rate the cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9 10 the story is gritty and real and does not compromise but the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work br br as a person who was born and raised in central africa i appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the <UNK> but this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film it takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of yesterday br br unlike the 1980 film the gods must be crazy which was a comic look at one african culture <UNK> modern technology yesterday has no intention of appealing to any <UNK> audience the movie simply is not fit for the common western mind and i doubt it was intended for the western mind the scenes are long and slow the editing is not paced for a <UNK> instant <UNK> world the dialog is not <UNK> or witty it is real movies about health <UNK> do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment it is education br br this movie is best viewed by those who know appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub sarah africa if you lack a broad enough world view to understand other cultures especially african cultures should skip this film do not waste you time with it go see <UNK> nights or larry the cable guy instead for your cross culture viewing br br i give it a 4 for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of african cultures for the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world i would give it a 7
<START> i have to admit i have a particular <UNK> for the humor and story telling style of british movies though not all of course succeed br br this film made me think and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face its about character development and relationships truth and lies and whether love is sometimes simply not enough some very nicely understated acting from all the participants especially the two leads tom <UNK> and emily watson br br there was a lot of fuss made about <UNK> park but with this piece i feel <UNK> has actually produced a better movie though it has not been a mainstream release br br an intelligent mature story about real people who are undeniably flawed but also capable of acts of genuine <UNK>
<START> i never want to see this movie again br br not only is it dreadfully bad but i can't stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick br br mostly i can't stand watching this terrible movie br br frankly there is no reason to watch this awful film the plot is just plain stupid the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films br br i warn you don't watch it the images will haunt you for a long while to come
<START> aside from the <UNK> scenes that <UNK> the swinging sixties especially with everyone dancing to <UNK> versions of <UNK> hits i am surprised how well this lightweight farce holds up <UNK> years later but indeed it does thanks to the <UNK> execution of its deception based plot and the sharp interplay of the three leads directed by the <UNK> stage to screen expert gene <UNK> this 1969 comedy is about julian winston a successful manhattan dentist and confirmed bachelor who pretends to be married in order to avoid long term commitment with his young girlfriend of a year toni in response to half hearted suicide attempt julian agrees to marry her but toni first insists on meeting his wife to <UNK> her conscience enter <UNK> devoted nurse stephanie to play the wife and the inevitable complications ensue with white lies growing into major <UNK> that lead to presumed <UNK> and de <UNK> br br as julian a relaxed walter matthau plays the <UNK> dentist in his typically <UNK> manner but he lets his two female co stars walk off with the picture in her big screen debut a 24 year old goldie hawn is still <UNK> her <UNK> laugh in persona but provides unexpected <UNK> and depth as toni she and matthau have great <UNK> chemistry in their scenes together screen legend ingrid bergman still <UNK> regal at <UNK> is obviously having a ball playing stephanie initially <UNK> and quick witted but <UNK> into a <UNK> spirit as the story <UNK> i particularly like how casual she appears after her overnight romp there is nice supporting work from rick <UNK> as <UNK> neighbor <UNK> and jack <UNK> as <UNK> smarmy actor buddy harvey billy <UNK> longtime <UNK> i a l diamond provides the <UNK> screenplay and opens up the story beyond its stage bound origins for <UNK> who is not the most cinematic of directors other than a couple of trailers there are no significant extras with the dvd
<START> this is an excellent movie and should be presented every year during the holidays christmas beautiful with great acting john denver at his best i e sincere kind talented and natural the town is <UNK> <UNK> and every bit as lovely as in the story
<START> the idea is not original if you have seen such kind of story before you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes the script the <UNK> of the actors and the screening is too obvious if you haven't seen such story before it is definitely a good experience you will enjoy the twist at the end don't forget to watch it again after you know the truth you will even more enjoy the plots even though i have a right guess at the very beginning i still couldn't help stick on my seat till the end br br conclusion a must see this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japan forget hollywood br br don't miss it
<START> i'm a massive fan of prison dramas which is reflected in oz being my all time favourite american tv show i guess the appeal lies in a type of smug <UNK> of wanting to see bad things happen to bad <UNK> <UNK> but i found don <UNK> riot in cell block 11 to be rather disappointing okay i knew since it was made in 1954 it would be devoid of bad language graphic and gang rape but even so it's a rather weak film compared to prison portrayal in earlier movies like each dawn i die and white heat the problem lies in the preachy tone of the movie with riot leader <UNK> being something of a prison <UNK> yeah that sounds ridiculous since he's a violent anti hero rather than some limp <UNK> tree <UNK> do <UNK> on a <UNK> but that's what he is in essence he wants to see prisoners <UNK> to <UNK> society rather than being made to suffer there's also a problem of making a b movie with such radical themes quite ironic that <UNK> would later make dirty harry where the only good criminal is a dead one and that is the cast isn't very good with <UNK> meyer as the being especially irritating in his performance like i said a disappointing movie
<START> even a decade after <UNK> aired on the abc near as i can tell current affairs <UNK> are still using the same tricks over and over time after time today tonight and a current affair are seen to be hiding behind the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight loss and dodgy shameless network <UNK> and pointless celebrity <UNK> pieces having often been subjected to that entertainment less void between 'the <UNK> at 6 00 <UNK> and of the <UNK> or at 7 00 <UNK> i was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings br br fortunately four rising comedians  rob jane kennedy <UNK> and tom  were also all too aware of all this and they crafted their <UNK> into one of the most <UNK> hilarious media <UNK> you'll ever see on television the four <UNK> had already met with comedic success their previous most memorable television <UNK> being on 'the late show ' the brilliant saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 1992 1993 and also featured fellow comedians mick tony martin jason <UNK> and <UNK> lucy br br <UNK> boasts an ensemble of colourful characters each with their own distinct and quirky personality the current affairs show is headed by nicely <UNK> mike moore rob an ambitious pretentious dim witted <UNK> mike works under the <UNK> that the show is serving a vital role for society  he is always <UNK> that they maintain their <UNK> integrity  and his executive producers have <UNK> into getting him to believe just that mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people occasionally he gets the <UNK> that he is being led along by the nose but usually this thought is <UNK> out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion br br brooke <UNK> jane kennedy is the senior female reporter on the show she is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile and if the <UNK> are to be believed she has had a romantic <UNK> with just about every male celebrity in existence another equally amoral reporter marty <UNK> is portrayed by <UNK> who <UNK> played inept <UNK> dennis in the australian comedy classic 'the castle ' emma ward alison is the line producer on the show and the single shining <UNK> of morality on the <UNK> set then there's the highly amusing <UNK> geoffrey <UNK> <UNK> best friend and <UNK> <UNK> makes a living out of always <UNK> with <UNK> opinion and of laughing <UNK> at his jokes before <UNK> that he doesn't get them br br for each of the shows three seasons we are treated to a different <UNK> executive producer brian thompson bruno lawrence who unfortunately passed away in 1995 runs the programme during season 1 he has a decent set of morals and is always civil to his employees and yet is more than willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings sam murphy kevin j wilson arrives on set in season 2 a hard <UNK> smooth talking producer who knows exactly how to string mike along the last episode of the second season when mike finally gets the better of him is a classic moment <UNK> steve <UNK> for the third season is crude unpleasant and <UNK> sexist it's therefore remarkable that you eventually come to like him br br with its cast of distinctive exaggerated characters <UNK> has a lot of fun <UNK> current affairs <UNK> and their dubious methods for winning ratings many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply often <UNK> many plot ideas from recent real life situations but this never really <UNK> from the show's ten years on celebrity cameos come in abundance with some of the most memorable appearances including pauline <UNK> don burke and jon english watch out for harry <UNK> hilarious appearance in the season 2 episode changing the face of current affairs playing larry an american hired by the network to <UNK> the show br br particularly in the third season i noticed that <UNK> <UNK> an extremely gritty form of black humour <UNK> for such a light hearted comedy show genuinely funny moments are born from brooke being <UNK> <UNK> into having an abortion murder by a crazed <UNK> and mike <UNK> <UNK> his best friend's hopes and dreams only to be told that he is a good friend the <UNK> final minute  minus an added scene during the credits which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced  was probably the greatest <UNK> ending to a comedy series that i've yet seen br br below is listed a very <UNK> list of my top five favourite <UNK> episodes but make no mistake every single half hour is absolutely hilarious and hard hitting satire br br 1 the siege season 1 br br 2 give 'em enough rope season 2 br br 3 addicted to fame season 3 br br 4 basic instincts season 2 br br 5 add sex and stir season 1
<START> i grew up watching the <UNK> boys on the <UNK> and even at young an age i could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies still it was fun to watch hall get the better of <UNK> after would beat the crap out him the east side kids stuff were never shown even though it was public <UNK> stuff and probably cheap to run it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch enter the year 2005 and i am about my childhood i can't find any <UNK> boys on dvd but i found the east side kids on disc and also on a public <UNK> website thankfully i saved my <UNK> and saw <UNK> <UNK> on the web for free and it really really blows now i can see there are some <UNK> boys and maybe <UNK> bad movie lovers here that gave this melodrama crap a 7 of 10 but c'mon folks this ain't even trying to be funny it's an east side kids drama not a comedy so it's no good the best part was seeing fight at the end he reminded me of my grade school days away like a girl when i would get in a fight it was kinda leonard <UNK> said in his mini bio that this flick is one of the better ones so you can just imagine the rest if you wanna see some halfway decent east side action see ghosts on the loose maybe but the bottom line is usually a comedy team starts out strong in their career and <UNK> off these <UNK> blew <UNK> early on then slowly picked it up until <UNK> antics dominated than they were at best still 2nd <UNK> stuff way below the 3 stooges who they imitate but amusing for those who grew up with them this feature won't bring back pleasant <UNK> boys memories and is best left to <UNK> fanatics
<START> well this is the best comedy movie i have ever seen my both favorite actors did good job salman khan and <UNK> khan <UNK> hope to see part 2 soon as i heard they will come back with part 2 as well i have request to those who haven't watched it yet please buy dvd and watch it u wont feel bored i am watching this movie 1 times a week all other was also good in this movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and others the music is also good it have also nice songs there are some sense which will kill u from laughing salman khan did very nice role and also <UNK> br br so must watch movie excellent job by actors and director
<START> i disagree with <UNK> portraying the <UNK> supporting zombies as creatures with an average iq of 23 i do believe their behaviour should reflect a lower iq than that something in the order of a iq a single <UNK> figure please br br the <UNK> series is quite uneven and this is the very worst episode <UNK> yet another mindless hollywood liberal or an <UNK> nerd who sucks up to the <UNK> establishment in order to re <UNK> his pitiful career must have finally realized that his directorial <UNK> had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now hence came up with this cringe inducing <UNK> left wing satire of the bush administration <UNK> and capitalism perhaps he felt he hadn't been overtly political before he wouldn't exactly be the first no talent to use <UNK> political propaganda to further his career when all else fails the maker of <UNK> such as <UNK> the howling and <UNK> <UNK> has been as useful a <UNK> to the horror genre as <UNK> hitler had been to world peace br br <UNK> uses lowest common <UNK> humour cheap and predictable gags which even the <UNK> of all blue collar union members wouldn't have trouble understanding or have you ever seen a clever subtle intelligent liberal satire <UNK> <UNK> has the <UNK> of all messages hence the language and manner in which this message is <UNK> has to be as simple and basic as sean <UNK> name and what better people to send this message to the popcorn <UNK> sheep than a couple of cocaine <UNK> <UNK> losers who've all fallen so low that they're forced to write for tv br br i don't want political propaganda either left or right in any type of movie but placing it in horror of all genres is a testament to the endless stupidity that <UNK> so supreme among hollywood's anti <UNK> so vapid was <UNK> that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote <UNK> that's what you get for finishing a movie school not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any stretch of the imagination
<START> i can never figure if this is the <UNK> soap opera ever produced or the art movie no matter john is utterly ravishing novel is not reduced but for once <UNK> to film if there is a fault it is in the original novel not in anthony beautiful movie anyone who has a problem with it's length almost certainly has not read the book and probably cannot read i do not like repeating <UNK> but ravishing serves the purpose br br apart from the storyline the players <UNK> but it is the australian sense of light and <UNK> that ultimately <UNK> like some dutch master uses a blast of light where van <UNK> would have used <UNK> one could <UNK> for cinematography this magnificent
<START> there's something wonderful about a revenge film everyone wakes up in the morning believing he she is the star of the movie and that anyone who <UNK> with one's own personal agenda is in some way the enemy revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self <UNK> rather than fighting back in the moment the hero draws upon built up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to <UNK> <UNK> quite naturally in the real world this type of revenge seldom <UNK> the tension because life is not a movie after the revenge is <UNK> the actions taken have their own consequences a good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter <UNK> in the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolved br br swimming with sharks is advertised as a comedy no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this <UNK> it's dark but it isn't dark comedy company of men and the works of todd <UNK> come much closer parts of the film are so brutal they pre date the current torture porn genre everyone is so obsessed with saw hostel there are some laughs there are laughs in saving private ryan too but it isn't labeled comedy br br the <UNK> problem with this film is that it hasn't earned its revenge case it is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to pay him back for all the <UNK> the hero <UNK> named guy is an <UNK> so vague we know literally nothing about him what does he do with his spare time does he have friends family how did he get where he is what are his interests this becomes a running <UNK> through the film no doubt inspired by the film's author's own struggle what do you want the answer to which we are denied by a vague cheat of an ending it's very difficult to care for such a character even if acted well even tom hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll such as punchline kevin spacey as the boss buddy is supposed to be a monster but he's too charismatic as an actor the best laughs came when he abused his assistant he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what guy will endure when <UNK> character is being tortured the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him guy is suddenly filmed as a <UNK> monster without <UNK> at this point any message the author had has been lost there's no hero in this film <UNK> no reason to care at all br br it's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business i worked for a similar boss and can <UNK> that it's not that far fetched i had similar wish <UNK> fantasies at that time and thought that i was justified i thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story actually the only woman there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film just by being your eager naive self that <UNK> won <UNK> and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person time and tide have revealed the truth that most monsters are really just the demons of an <UNK> personal psyche and <UNK> is usually based in the self as the film points out if guy was so unhappy he only had to leave the film doesn't offer any denouement at all surprise ending notwithstanding we still know nothing about the protagonists we can't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too in short there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that shock the film business can be pretty brutal br br there are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge style fantasies both the feel good variety 9 working girl the devil wears <UNK> and not so much war of the <UNK> the remake of the hills have eyes this isn't one of them despite a fun turn by <UNK> del toro in the emily blunt role from <UNK> and some interesting work by spacey and michelle forbes this is a frustrating mean confused and slightly dull creation of self <UNK> from a director who has one hopes worked it all out by now
<START> this show lasted for most of the 1980s and had its moments but plots were usually <UNK> thin and often painfully unfunny br br terry scott and june <UNK> were wasted in this sitcom they both deserved better but it does provide some fond memories and i have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes june talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion when she is not being a foil to terry and she really is clever br br the 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class middle aged comedy and many people remember it <UNK> but i prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of spitting image
<START> if you like me enjoy films with plots and convincing actors then alien vs predator <UNK> is probably not the way to go in summary alien lands in typical american town predator lands in american town both have a bit of a fight us government blows up town some people get away i'm sorry i think i might have <UNK> the ending its easy to <UNK> someone who's being critical people cry out i bet you couldn't do any better i bet i could having made this film watched it and then turned to <UNK> each other with a pat on the back and a job well done there must surely have been the <UNK> of <UNK> in the room
<START> the three shorts included on this <UNK> <UNK> in 1959 are timeless chaplin classics nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either <UNK> score for these films and the <UNK> added as <UNK> sections between the shorts are also well done the problem with this <UNK> is a minor one yet annoying the shorts have been stretch <UNK> to fit the 24 frame p s speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p s this results is jerky motion that doesn't look very attractive and yet this was an <UNK> solution given the limitations of <UNK> <UNK> technology at the time it's just not <UNK> that the current dvd version is <UNK> the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch <UNK> there are separate restored versions of these classics available even on dvd and it would not be a problem to <UNK> the image but alas this has not been done br br a minor <UNK> has taken up a lot of space in my article but i say again a minor <UNK> it should not detract all that much from the experience although it <UNK> one point from my rating the shorts are still worth <UNK>
<START> this is one of those movies i watched and wondered why did i watch it what did i find so interesting about it being a truck driver myself i didn't find it very realistic no i've never used a nor have i ever seen nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new <UNK> thousand dollar <UNK> either br br same thing about a <UNK> whom has never <UNK> the lady in question until the end of the movie and well he still really didn't and only getting 50 bucks 'a <UNK> when the prostitute gets 200 00 well 150 00 after his cut yeah br br i still laugh at the lot lizard comment made <UNK> lot <UNK> they'll screw anything with 20 bucks and some are men dressed as woman or something equally as weird meaning we're better then them as we may still be prostitutes but we get paid better br br other then that it's just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home she's 18 remember and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing dead end job at least she had a roof over her head and a job she turned five tricks on the road i wonder if the <UNK> 00 she made was worth it i'd guess not
<START> i could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer but the lure of the dvd box got me to rent it anyway boy was i right br br also for some reason the dvd version is very fuzzy and unclear at times in terms of video quality it appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder it looks so bad i really did not like the plot and after watching the movie i was very let down i will not tell any spoilers but let it be said that the end was so bad that i laughed it has been done so many times before br br the whole story seems like something that came out of a middle <UNK> english paper if i had to <UNK> one movie as the worst horror movie i've ever seen this one may just be it i can't believe they actually released this film it really isn't worth the rent or a penny of anyone's money unless you want a good laugh at the movie's expense
<START> this is one of the best <UNK> of the 60's put on film arthur penn director of bonnie and clyde and little big man saw that steve outstanding script <UNK> with truth and from these two talents comes solid cinema <UNK> georgia miles gives male viewers a hit of <UNK> nostalgia for the <UNK> beauty who is almost within our <UNK> but always just out of reach just see it or you cinematic education will be <UNK>
<START> after his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late 1960s rock hudson starred in lots of different projects including tv shows and lesser films however i believe that <UNK> is his only turn as a mad scientist and that's probably a good thing i guess he needed the work br br driving along one dark and <UNK> night brilliant dr paul hudson hits and <UNK> a <UNK> which he brings back to his lab that looks somewhat like a <UNK> <UNK> basement he then manages to raise the <UNK> unborn puppy outside the <UNK> so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being he raises victoria the beautiful barbara <UNK> from a <UNK> the same way victoria grows at an astonishing pace and soon <UNK> into a gorgeous young woman br br predictably things go very wrong after a <UNK> beginning sister in law martha diane <UNK> begins to wonder where the young woman came from and victoria herself begins to show signs of <UNK> and violence the final sequence is one long car chase straight out of <UNK> and the <UNK> after which has shockingly aged in just a few <UNK> by a frantic who tries in vain to destroy his <UNK> creation along with its unborn child all of this is accompanied by <UNK> <UNK> roaring <UNK> a car fire and lots of <UNK> the limp bunch of <UNK> <UNK> working on victoria while <UNK> in more <UNK> than creepy br br although just made in 1976 this movie is very dated the only difference between this and the many 1940s mad scientist movies is that hudson plays the lead role rather than boris karloff the sets are pretty cheap and very <UNK> to today's audiences to the extent that <UNK> reel to reel tape <UNK> is about the size of a <UNK> much of the action takes place in a poorly <UNK> laboratory hudson <UNK> through his <UNK> role giving the impression that he's truly a washed up movie star while <UNK> and <UNK> are much more believable surprisingly <UNK> <UNK> pops up briefly as a chess player br br the <UNK> video transfer is very <UNK> looking as though it had been made from a poor vhs copy using home equipment if you're nostalgic for 1976 watch this once just to say you did otherwise watch a football game or soap opera instead
<START> the hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time this film produced by screenwriter <UNK> who gave us the oscar winning film network deals with <UNK> staff gross incompetence and <UNK> corruption at a large <UNK> hospital in manhattan george c scott in a superb performance as the head <UNK> is driven to alcoholism and a death wish as he tries to recover from a divorce throwing his son out of the house and worst of all a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take <UNK> over caring and healing of the sick and injured br br mr scott makes the movie his own and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment you can feel the pain pun intended of what this hospital has done to him the vivid images of this <UNK> incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene br br if only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out this picture would be brilliant unfortunately there is a sub plot of scott falling for the daughter of a <UNK> patient the patient has been murdering people at the hospital this is where credibility of the picture becomes strained the romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture and the mental patient posing as a doctor i found to be totally unbelievable a simple security call and records check should have prevented the <UNK> patient from doing the killings it takes almost the whole movie before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital i could not see one person doing that much damage even as corrupt as this hospital is br br furthermore george c scott's character is <UNK> another pun intended because the script has too many things happening at once for example within a period of 20 minutes you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didn't do with the <UNK> and aids it's the same story someone's <UNK> was read wrong someone was given the wrong <UNK> and died the doctor <UNK> on the wrong patient than another doctor does the same thing <UNK> a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be <UNK> the patient was on her coffee break there is also a lot of subtle dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer br br this <UNK> of medical <UNK> is unforgettable however the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie when the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and scott's reactions to this you are glued to the screen but the conversations between scott and the mad <UNK> daughter force the film into a mystery type who done it scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie when the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings i wondered the following why did the producers need the find the killer mad patient sub plot i think the only point of scott's character having a relationship with the <UNK> <UNK> daughter was to give him anybody with whom to communicate the hospital should have <UNK> its <UNK> <UNK> of the medical profession by <UNK> the love interest and mad patient scenes it should have focused on the incompetent b s within its walls more frequently in an era where this movie could have been phenomenal the sub plot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been
<START> overall the movie heart of darkness was pitiful compared to the book anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the countless obvious flaws there is an <UNK> difference between the two it seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle i couldn't imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of <UNK> heart of darkness the immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to <UNK> interpret <UNK> story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretation br br first capturing the details of the story is <UNK> the <UNK> fine points created by joseph conrad cannot be rightfully <UNK> through film <UNK> feelings and emotions cannot be equally <UNK> in the movie if you have taken on the enormous task of <UNK> <UNK> work then you know as well as i that conrad only wrote half the story the additional half is a series of connections made by the reader you as the reader are required to be capable of and connecting joseph <UNK> ideas as a result several crucial details are absent in the movie br br also although the movie was an adequate length the film seemed short it seemed that conrad was able to pack many more details into 75 pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half the speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters <UNK> was much more of a stranger the viewpoint of the book puts you into <UNK> shoes however in the movie you're almost watching <UNK> from a distance i began to think that the director was trying to <UNK> the same read between the lines method as conrad did however the connections were weak i know that if i had not read the book then i would in no way be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters br br finally <UNK> also seemed to be interpreted <UNK> his role was short and the details weren't all included it was impossible to comprehend the true <UNK> in the length of time he was shown an important detail in the book was that <UNK> had become a god to the <UNK> i didn't think that significant detail was defined also in the book <UNK> represented a soulless being he had died inside long ago i believe the director <UNK> this detail however instead of <UNK> it he just had <UNK> <UNK> around and <UNK> everything moreover it seemed like the director attempted to make <UNK> seem mysterious however instead he seemed entirely <UNK> br br altogether this movie reminded me of a teenager <UNK> to finish a science project due the next day it appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time the characters were <UNK> crucial details were left out and overall the central plot was lost in translation
<START> never mind if <UNK> <UNK> 1944 ' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing clarence <UNK> <UNK> fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral after achieving modest success through her appearance in come home 1943 ' young elizabeth taylor age 12 landed her first leading role as <UNK> brown a passionate <UNK> with an obsession for horses though filmed in california the story adapted from a novel by <UNK> is set in a small <UNK> on the english countryside and full advantage is taken of the technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue <UNK> and green <UNK> mickey rooney takes top billing as <UNK> taylor a misguided ex <UNK> with <UNK> intentions whose relationship with young <UNK> <UNK> his sense of dignity and opens a new optimistic chapter in his life though he <UNK> struggles in one sequence when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses rooney is enjoyable as the <UNK> but passionate young man who must prove his worth br br it is perhaps a good thing that elizabeth taylor had those <UNK> <UNK> eyes because her acting abilities at this young age were rather limited her more emotional sequences in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of <UNK> strike one as being rather hollow and the <UNK> naive notion that simply believing will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad <UNK> by practically every <UNK> inspirational sporting film ever made nevertheless taylor is bright eyed and enthusiastic and she works well with mickey rooney who was no stranger to being a child star anne <UNK> plays a very important role as mother once a famous <UNK> who not only <UNK> the english channel but was lovingly trained by none other than <UNK> <UNK> own father i liked that <UNK> was not told about this until the film's final seconds with mrs brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency rather than <UNK> the memory of his late father for financial gain as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning br br the film reaches its climax at the grand national <UNK> where <UNK> has at the last moment decided to ride her own horse the <UNK> in the world famous competition under the <UNK> of a <UNK> male she goes on as expected to win the race but is later <UNK> either because she's a girl or because she <UNK> from the horse before she was allowed to <UNK> what a stupid rule this extended race sequence is exceedingly well done effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve <UNK> pre race seconds and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as <UNK> character stranded behind tall <UNK> and waiting <UNK> for somebody to provide an accurate update it doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding in several scenes we can clearly see a creepy looking man in a wig but the positive message remains the same i'll <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> the <UNK> of millions of young girls over the last sixty years and it's power to inspire has <UNK> little with time
<START> is a charming if slightly animated movie that considering it was made in the 1941 has stood the test of time incredibly well now i have to admit i have a soft spot for to <UNK> as it is called in the united kingdom having watched a vhs version taped of the tv by our parents many times with my siblings imagine my surprise when i woke up this morning just in time to catch it on channel four at never the less the film was just as delightful as i remembered it with the animation standing the test of time and a lovely moral tale which should appeal to parents and children alike maybe one day i to shall share this forgotten classic with children of my own with a nice running time for kids <UNK> <UNK> and a simple yet involving storyline there really is something for everyone in this tale of the little guy coming good i really could see this being successfully remade in cgi take note pixar
<START> pam <UNK> is the super soul sister of the 1970's appearing in many <UNK> films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation i can safely say that black mama white mama may be the worst pam <UNK> movie i've ever seen br br <UNK> is lee and margaret <UNK> is karen they are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after <UNK> revolutionary friends attacked the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to each other the film becomes the <UNK> ones for women but has three separate plots a fat criminal <UNK> sleaze star <UNK> diaz wants lee dead a cowboy bounty hunter the excellent sid <UNK> <UNK> for the two girls and <UNK> revolutionary friends search for her the film eventually becomes so convoluted and <UNK> with the two women that the title should have been men chasing women <UNK> an action star is not given any chance to participate in any of the many overlong action scenes <UNK> is excellent as karen and <UNK> is ok as lee but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots one interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and his chief to drop their pants so he can shoot the one with the smallest penis judged by his whore but is easily forgotten amidst all the mayhem br br black mama white mama starts out great as a women in prison film complete with lesbian <UNK> and a shower scene then completely switches to a chase film if director eddie romero famous for directing <UNK> horror films had just stuck with the <UNK> theme he would have been fine instead gets real old real fast and the surprise ending just makes the audience wonder why they sat through a 90 minute film for it to end like this another problem where is the film supposed to be set while some of the accents are hispanic and cities have spanish names los etc all the natives are obviously asian hmmm recommended only for die hard <UNK> fans who even then will be disappointed
<START> i just got done watching this movie and i have to say it was a good film i loved some of the good guy's and i loved the killer robot but the movie had some in it br br the <UNK> of the people in it was kind of stupid i think people should of <UNK> the <UNK> of this movie for how lame it was at the end the first half hour was good but then it just dragged on and on then i was happy it was over but still loved the the killer robot and some of the movie's good guy's in it br br i think it was the best two <UNK> i have ever spent because i do like stupid b movie's like this one and come on it is a b movie everyone
<START> the <UNK> is perhaps the most <UNK> of <UNK> films the film is <UNK> with wit and spirit for the most part provided by the energetic character of norman tom although his character is clearly gay and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer albert finney that he <UNK> the film never <UNK> on it or makes it more than it is br br the gritty style of peter <UNK> that worked so well in <UNK> is again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and <UNK> this is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious in the end the <UNK> will bore many people silly but it will truly be a delight to those who love british cinema br br 7 7 out of 10
<START> this film is a tour de force from julie who directs and does the stage design and masks no one comes near to matching her imagination on the modern operatic stage since making this film in 1992 she has had much success in film making and in directing musicals one can only hope that she can be <UNK> to return to opera one day i would love to see a ring cycle directed by her the current at <UNK> garden has giants with over sized hands just like the characters in this film the current <UNK> at uses japanese <UNK> coincidence maybe or evidence that influence is <UNK> br br uses <UNK> costumes masks puppets and <UNK> birds to recreate the story of <UNK> on a stage set on <UNK> above a lake red <UNK> are a recurring theme they are used as an <UNK> <UNK> when <UNK> is born they hang down from eyes after he has <UNK> himself in a breathtaking effect they are used to make a <UNK> when <UNK> of his father is by puppets br br this neo classical opera ballet by enjoyed justified obscurity until this film brought it to life the music is uninspired but <UNK> and philip jesse norman and a very young make the most of it the singers are fairly <UNK> in <UNK> with wishes min <UNK> is the dancing <UNK> to singing <UNK> this creates some slight confusion towards the end when dancing <UNK> <UNK> out the eyes of singing <UNK> br br the <UNK> is in latin but do not worry if your high school latin is a bit rusty there is a helpful narrator who introduces and describes each scene in japanese
<START> when i was 8 years old and going through my marx brothers phase my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film the big store late on friday night and set the vcr to tape it for me when i woke up on saturday due no doubt to a in the tv guide my father and i discovered the story of mankind had been recorded instead br br the big store was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the <UNK> finest works of cinema when compared with the story of mankind i can almost justify tv error in that the marx brothers <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> appear in both movies although in the story of mankind they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes <UNK> plays peter <UNK> plays some guy talking to christopher <UNK> and <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scene lasts about half a minute <UNK> only has two or three lines <UNK> scene is at least funny but horribly <UNK> <UNK> by today's standards the rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning they <UNK> out some of the finest actors of the day and made them <UNK> total garbage what a disappointment br br tv guide i sent you a nice letter i'm still waiting for an <UNK> br br for the record the big store has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller <UNK> and a couple of songs by virginia o'brien i was really looking forward to seeing it
<START> this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen this is slow plot less and boring the cinematographer deserved to be shot there were various aspects of unintentional comedy one of which was jared being oddly camp raised many laughs but also many <UNK> don't watch with anyone anytime any place if u hate someone recommend they buy or rent this big waste of time and money thanks gus van <UNK> not i cant think of anything else to say except don't ever see this movie it will make u want to jump off a cliff hope gus and his mates read this comment before it's too late and he makes a sequel or some other catastrophe with what appeared to be shot with a camera phone
<START> peter cushing and donald <UNK> are legendary actors and director <UNK> was the man behind the successful greek giallo esquire thriller death kiss in 1974 and yet when you combine the three talents all you get is this complete load of drivel god only knows what drove the likes of peter cushing and donald <UNK> to star in this <UNK> devil worship flick but i really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their <UNK> the story focuses on a group of devil <UNK> that kidnap some kids leading another group to go after them the pace of the plot is very slow and this <UNK> that the film is very boring the plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this and no doubt done much better the obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesn't manage to overcome this at any point this really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the <UNK> enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended
<START> saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later i'm watching it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story does it <UNK> of lifetime movie network yes but alas lifetime was not even in existence back then so it needed to air br br the cast was excellent the story was a little <UNK> two women become close friends and <UNK> to either one friend is having an affair with he other friends husband she's invited over to the house for a dinner party which is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend she is horrified and tries to break off the affair shortly afterwards he is <UNK> killed in a car accident which is for both women of course the wife finds out by accident about this affair and wants holly out of her life now but their friendship is able to <UNK> because they need each other br br i thought it was a very good story a great cast and i really enjoyed it
<START> this is christmas time a <UNK> in terms of <UNK> or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the italian cinema it was something like 30 40 years that the italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size this is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the italian masterpieces of the past needless to quote any name and finally this is also a big production for italian standards of the time in this movie there is a rare balance of different elements all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of <UNK> real poetry real humor real <UNK> real drama real beauty no <UNK> no easy surreal <UNK> no typical like <UNK> no over acting no director there is also a cool use of two heartbreaking nina <UNK> songs whose music i <UNK> has never been used in a proper way for a score so if this will not be a real for the italian cinema it is an extraordinary evolution for <UNK> after his another definitive beautiful film is not to be missed it is that kind of <UNK> helpful to enjoy movie making movie watching helpful to enjoy and understand life <UNK>
<START> a rather silly little film you just may love br br although rather corny and cliché at times it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun five teams are engaged on a <UNK> hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest just for the sheer joy knowing yours is the best team br br notable for several screen <UNK> including david <UNK> first film role after his dr pepper be a pepper commercials and before his major 1981 hit american werewolf in london also features paul in what i believe is his first pee wee herman esquire roll a year before he became known for it and last but not least mr spin city and alex keaton himself michael j fox gets his first film role here fans will remember stephen <UNK> as <UNK> in animal house outside of that no names but all funny characters br br doubt it has ever made it to dvd but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on a late late show sometime if you do is worth your watch you may hate it but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love
<START> the world may never know the film that did take the best animated short oscar that year anna and <UNK> is very good but it's no big <UNK> both are available on expanded <UNK> world's greatest animation <UNK> in case you'd like to compare br br <UNK> and its director richard have attracted so much attention that there's little for me to add i'd like to note however that the film contains one of my very favorite single shots in an animated short the one where the man opens the door to let the cat out i don't want to give away the actual events depicted here but the first time i saw the shot i was from one mood to another then seconds later to still another that shot has never failed to affect me that way since for this shot and for the way builds up to that set of moments the big <UNK> deserves the tag of masterpiece
<START> first of all this movie is gross to the point of nauseating and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again i tried watching it because it looked like it might be funny but it soon became quite disturbing with the ice cream made out of body parts and surprisingly graphic effects it opens with a boy named greg witnessing the gruesome murder of an ice cream man greg subsequently goes crazy and grows up to be the title character by what appear to be mob <UNK> there is no explanation for this murder making it the biggest wtf moment in the entire movie other lesser wtf moments include the surreal asylum greg goes to featuring evil <UNK> a woman speaking in <UNK> because she has been possessed by the holy spirit what this has to do with anything i don't know and the fact that olivia holy crap has her career <UNK> this badly <UNK> is in it br br none of these are good enough reasons to watch it the only reason is for the character <UNK> who is a skinny kid with <UNK> stuffed under his shirt so that he looks like a fat kid for some reason this struck me as hilarious i stayed up far longer into the night than i should have watching this movie just to figure out if there was some reason they couldn't use an actual fat kid for the role although i fell asleep before the end i've gathered from other reviews that <UNK> ends up losing the weight okay so they didn't have the budget to pull this off realistically suggestion to the director how about making the character not overweight br br that's it if the <UNK> of <UNK> has not interested you enough there is no other reason to acknowledge this film's existence if disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your preferred source of entertainment check out the far superior the stuff instead
<START> susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august a single mother who's the working definition of the word <UNK> and her <UNK> <UNK> daughter adele wanting to make a fresh start in a big city moves them from <UNK> to california br br decent if not exceptional or particularly memorable with some serious and sad moments it pushes some emotional buttons that's for sure best thing it offers is a solid cast and sarandon and portman are quite good in the leads even if their characters are one dimensional at times br br could be better could be worse br br i gave this one seven out of ten
<START> based on the actual event this epic is set in the year <UNK> b c and tells the true story of the <UNK> of china action packed and filled with intrigue passion <UNK> and unforgettable battle sequences it held my attention throughout in spite of its <UNK> minute length br br the king <UNK> played by li is obsessed with <UNK> the seven <UNK> of china and becoming its first emperor his lover lady <UNK> played by the beautiful actress <UNK> li <UNK> a plot <UNK> she will travel to the <UNK> kingdom of <UNK> to set a fake assassination plot in motion which will give the king an excuse to <UNK> <UNK> however she falls in love with the assassin as the king becomes more and more ruthless br br there are subplots and tragedy and constant high drama there are scenes of great beauty and of <UNK> cruelty there is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space br br the deep characterization made me think of shakespeare and tragic events that call to mind greek drama and yet it is totally chinese as it deals with age old questions of whether the ends justify the means and raises the questions dealing with life and death and good and evil and all the <UNK> edges in between br br it is the story of individuals against the backdrop of history a history that has shaped china for the past two thousand years i was swept up in the story as well as the moral questions raised there are no easy answers and this was one of the strengths of the movie br br recommended but be prepared for the violence and gore br br

<START> normally i wouldn't go to the trouble of commenting on a horror movie sequel because it's usually assumed that they're bad and if you watch them with a healthy <UNK> they can be very fun and enjoyable to <UNK> laugh at however this chapter of the ongoing halloween saga came close to up everything the original stood for in the very first movie dr <UNK> said very <UNK> i might add that michael myers was evil and this tries to explain why doing a bad job of it i might add in my opinion he was much scarier when he was just a blood hungry freak the whole <UNK> cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new <UNK> into the halloween <UNK> the result was a boring predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny
<START> 2001 wasn't perhaps eric roberts best year both <UNK> and this came out watched <UNK> a while ago and really thought it sucked and being <UNK> worst but that had it´s share moment of fun and d standard this one doesn't have a thing br br tommy lee thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days the story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a <UNK> breaking in <UNK> br br the two thing that stands out are martin <UNK> and eric roberts you could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism br br i say thank you roberts see you next time and hopefully a better one

<START> i have never seen american werewolf in london but this movie was very entertaining when renting it i thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects i thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other nice the <UNK> reminded me a lot of werewolf <UNK> in other movies but the werewolves themselves are very <UNK> and not very dog like gore i do believe there is too much in this movie which really takes away from the horror when every frame has blood in it taking the violence seriously is hard br br j <UNK> <UNK> grade
<START> for awhile i was hooked on shows like ghost hunters and destination truth and stuff even though i thought they were full of crap i found them interesting and entertaining and that's why we watch entertainment tv it's fun to turn off your brain and believe that every shadow caught on camera is not just some shadow but some insane asylum tormented spirit or something so long as you can snap back to the real world later br br that being said enjoying <UNK> state requires more than merely <UNK> your brain off it requires you to <UNK> lead in large doses on a regular basis during your childhood then suffer repeated head trauma then take up <UNK> paint in your teens then you have to get high drunk and watch br br <UNK> state is beyond the <UNK> which i can enjoy with a degree of critical thinking that you'll find on ghost hunters which i still find to be reasonably interesting and entertaining program it's pseudo everything br br the show follows the adventures of a group of students from penn state university not to be confused with university of <UNK> lead by ryan as they take it upon themselves to <UNK> demons and spirits using <UNK> from whatever religion seems most dramatic at the time ranging from catholic <UNK> performed by college <UNK> to spells cast by socially awkward to native american <UNK> <UNK> to their credit these are performed by native americans if you believe in or you're catholic or a <UNK> of a traditional native american <UNK> i think you'd want their <UNK> <UNK> performed by someone who isn't a <UNK> college student with some free time i don't remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests threw up their hands and said it's no use call up an after school club from the state college this one is too much for us they've probably read the <UNK> article on <UNK> the show is frankly insulting to the intelligence to the viewer the show's opening title sequence has ryan talking about the <UNK> research society saying that when he came to penn state notice you don't see any shows where the host says the same thing but instead of penn state he says when i came to <UNK> or after i got my <UNK> physics degree he found other people with similar interest in the <UNK> he says they are sometimes warriors i remember when i used to pretend i was a warrior and i fought ghosts i was six then the <UNK> ryan brings out the flamboyant and obnoxious chip <UNK> who pretends to go into and become possessed by <UNK> at the cast awesome i thought people had learned some sense about how ridiculous the idea of <UNK> and <UNK> is after crossing over went off the air the show takes itself way too seriously as this small group of societal <UNK> pretends they are battling against some ancient <UNK> evil production values are low stories are boring and unlike ghost hunters which will occasionally catch something <UNK> although likely <UNK> but interesting nonetheless on their equipment ps requires you to believe that the noises and <UNK> that they hear are evidence of demons <UNK> and possibly the only thing scary about this show is that there are people out there that take it seriously the only thing <UNK> about it is that the people on it are able to make each episode while keeping a straight face br br call me jaded but i feel like the great mysteries of the universe and the <UNK> are too great to be solved in a half hour tv show by a <UNK> <UNK> at a state school br br all that being said i highly recommend that everyone watch this show at least once if for no other reason than the sheer entertainment derived from watching a truly terrible movie or tv show or you can make a drinking game out of it i think the second would be <UNK>
<START> although this was the first hunter s thompson documentary i have seen it was average at best despite the of huge star appearances such as johnny <UNK> bill murray gary busey and a few others i was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting what kept me watching was some of the old clips from fear and loathing in las vegas and where the buffalo <UNK> not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know i still think they were <UNK> it because it could have been <UNK> down by at least half still if your a fan i would you'll like anything that has to do with hunter best regards
<START> this film is one of the worst adaptations of pride and prejudice ever filmed and if jane austen were alive she would demand that her name be removed from the film <UNK> novel is only <UNK> a story of the development of true love between elizabeth <UNK> and <UNK> it is also a commentary on the class structure of <UNK> britain this film focuses only on the love story thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel br br there are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film in the film the dance at which <UNK> <UNK> elizabeth is not the <UNK> dancing done by the <UNK> to which the <UNK> lucas and <UNK> families belong but is rather the dancing of the lower classes the <UNK> would not have been dancing as if they were at a <UNK> <UNK> dance there are costume and hair problems too the <UNK> of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear when <UNK> women of the <UNK> period were not so <UNK> as to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> in public the worst historical <UNK> is the early morning meeting of elizabeth in her <UNK> and coat and mr <UNK> sans <UNK> and <UNK> at which they admit their love for each other this is an unforgivable liberty with the novel no respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of <UNK> or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour br br but the worst thing of all with this film is the <UNK> of <UNK> dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue <UNK> dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he she can write like austen the writer of the non austen dialogue not only lacks <UNK> talent but also has no feel for <UNK> style the <UNK> of the two styles is jarring br br as for the acting the best is done by <UNK> <UNK> who clearly understands the <UNK> of the <UNK> brenda <UNK> takes some liberties in making mrs <UNK> less awful than <UNK> portrayal her portrayal is interesting and seems to work donald sutherland is miscast his affected british accent is terrible and he portrays mr <UNK> too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century matthew portrayal of <UNK> is flat i can't imagine anyone falling in love with his mr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a pretty elizabeth but her portrayal of elizabeth <UNK> is far too modern <UNK> focuses on the <UNK> but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social <UNK> and conventions of the time she would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period br br if one is making a period movie one must be true to the period this film needed an historical <UNK> who actually knows something about the <UNK> period it also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of <UNK> text i can only hope emma thompson decides to do a film of pride and prejudice in the near future to <UNK> this abomination from our minds br br the best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the english countryside <UNK> is well used as as it was in the 1995 bbc adaptation but pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film true fans of austen will rush home to watch their dvds of the far superior 1995 bbc production with jennifer <UNK> and colin <UNK> or to read <UNK> text in order to wipe this version from their minds
<START> set in a california <UNK> camp in an future an english film crew capture proceedings as young students and political are put on trial under a fictional <UNK> that allows the united states government to suspend civil liberties for its own citizens in cases of <UNK> without the right to <UNK> or the necessity of evidence in such cases the government is <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> anyone they believe may engage in future activities of <UNK> the group on trial includes a feminist a black <UNK> and a folk singer br br those convicted by the a conservative <UNK> have the choice of a lengthy prison sentence or three days in punishment park in which they can <UNK> their freedom by reaching an american flag in the desert they must accomplish this without food or water they are also to be pursued by armed national guards and police who can return them to the camp if captured to face the <UNK> sentence attributed to each person convicted the reality is different those that choose punishment park are hunted and killed or <UNK> with no hope of gaining their freedom after a policeman is found dead in the park the park seems to be a training ground for the police and guards who need to master these acts of <UNK> so they can be put to use in open american society br br shot on <UNK> and in the documentary style developed by in his celebrated <UNK> and the controversial the war game for the bbc he <UNK> with the prisoners and guards and <UNK> the <UNK> trial inter cutting between them to create a totally convincing political movie that still remains vital and relevant using his knowledge of the medium has produced a driving relentless and ultimately frightening film portrayal of an entirely fictional american political <UNK> camp that would not convince if it wasn't for his flawless construction many of the actors are amateurs <UNK> with broad characters the sparks fly in the trial scenes in which each case is heard in part to the fact that kept those on trial away from the jury until the filming of those scenes also claims that the actors are often expressing their own opinions which certainly explain the <UNK> as well as the believability of their performances br br the film has been heavily <UNK> for the opinions of those that see it it has been claimed that the film is <UNK> and <UNK> represents that <UNK> and war are the root of america's social problems while these criticisms may be valid it is important to consider that the film is working on a fictional <UNK> level and it is perhaps the realism that the film so cleverly <UNK> that encourages such a <UNK> opinion on its content in fact the films most important theme is the problem of itself the judges and brutal law officers are on one side and the <UNK> are clearly on the other with no <UNK> made on either side this seems to be what the movie is really about the new law and the park itself is the <UNK> of a situation where <UNK> between the two political positions has been lost br br made during and in protest to the vietnam war and the treatment of those who opposed the war in america the films main themes of <UNK> <UNK> of its own citizens and <UNK> on civil liberties still strike the same <UNK> in the era of the <UNK> act and the identity card it also strikes a disturbing <UNK> with news footage of <UNK> bay and the treatment of <UNK> prisoners at the hands of allied forces br br the threat of internal is such a <UNK> issue that the film cannot fail to connect with current attitudes to the subject not surprisingly the film has had a <UNK> distribution history being <UNK> to an extreme due to its content but the disturbing fact that this movie is that can still remain so relevant today suggests that the wait has not been for nothing punishment park is a film that has had to fight to be seen anywhere and it demands your attention
<START> this might be for those who have been to summer camps but it sure isn't an entertaining camp i went to one before but it didn't make me scream up and down for joy instead it made my head hurt br br the first thing you notice is that bill murray actually had some hair in the 70s yeah and he also didn't mind running some but to get him to run a lot you would need to give him a woman to chase after br br its not that some of the stunts can't be funny for example the running joke with one of the <UNK> who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed instead its that the jokes and stunts were poorly setup and executed it just failed to be funny br br to somebody who loves comedy this is a pain others are glued to it for life i wish it was more like leonard part 6 but it doesn't come close f
<START> the show is at least partially <UNK> so is not reality just pretending to be reality which makes me believe at least anyone without face <UNK> out is a fake episode br br proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed there is already camera crew on the boat before he gets there can been seen as his boat approaches br br the actors playing <UNK> officers didn't remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it which would never happen in reality br br they also <UNK> the <UNK> in the car park and did not drive up to the <UNK> entrance which does not make any sense unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there
<START> ever i always wanted to write that many years ago in 1993 as i recall it one of my former classmates <UNK> me to watch what he called a epic masterpiece to this day it stands out to me as the worst movie i have ever seen the acting the story the effects everything is bad unless you are one of these people who just loves to appreciate trash you should pass on this however chances are that since you are reading this you've already seen it br br out of almost 500 movies this is the only non short i've given a 1 10 br br i haven't seen any other low budget asian warrior flicks so i guess there's even worse things out there scary br br p
<START> the first time i saw this film it was with this cute girl i was attracted to we had a lot of fun laughing at it and generally making fun so my impression was that it was terrible but watchable for value then as part of our <UNK> we watched it together again on video as it turns out the movie is just terrible and unwatchable it's amazing how cute girls can change the way the world looks
<START> the biggest and most <UNK> things of the <UNK> movie was ending for the is identical to <UNK> except kid in the <UNK> was a bit better acted and action then the adult the similarities to the <UNK> movies was rather poor choice in plot line the only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the <UNK> then the plot went down hill from there would have been nice if a different plot had been <UNK> rather then <UNK> the earlier movies the <UNK> movie should have taken lesson from park series in various plots the only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is aztec rex the repeated scenes as if taken from the <UNK> movies leaves a person thinking of those movies
<START> ken harrison a young <UNK> in his early thirties is seriously injured in a road accident end of story br br end of story that is in the sense of end of any physical action not in the sense of end of the film <UNK> life is saved but he is <UNK> from the neck down when he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive the rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and <UNK> of <UNK> and the right to die br br <UNK> main antagonist in this debate is his doctor michael <UNK> although the case against <UNK> is often presented in religious terms here it is presented in purely <UNK> ones if dr <UNK> has any deep religious <UNK> these are never expressed in the film he believes <UNK> however that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a <UNK> of that duty ken therefore finds himself in a catch 22 situation he must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life <UNK> however considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and <UNK> <UNK> dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital br br richard dreyfuss as ken and john cassavetes as dr <UNK> put across their respective points of view <UNK> and with sincerity but this cannot hide the fact that whose life is it anyway simply does not work as a film at one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as <UNK> because of the differences between the two media when plays were filmed therefore the general tendency was to open them up by filming on location as well as on studio sets by taking liberties with the <UNK> text often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters br br i have never seen brian <UNK> play but i suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema there is very little physical action most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies <UNK> such a plot does not lend itself to the opening up device at all and the resulting film is very static dominated by talk at the expense of action although it is well written and there is some good acting i am surprised that a film was ever made of such an <UNK> subject 4 10
<START> this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot revolves around a man named <UNK> who wears metal <UNK> bites people on the neck and walks around <UNK> like a chicken without the <UNK> of the arms he also thinks he's a chicken br br sounds bizarre right well to me the more bizarre and weird the person is the better the more gore the better and so on br br the movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution they mention that he has created some <UNK> in prison that he used to bite people on the neck he also like a chicken and thinks he's a chicken br br if i had a patient like this there is no way i would release him br br first <UNK> heads to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a <UNK> and walks away then he <UNK> in the back seat of a woman's car and she drives all the way to her home br br while at the house <UNK> ties up the woman to the bed when the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend come home <UNK> hides br br later through the film a cop comes to the front door and asks about the mother you can clearly see the daughter is scared out of her mind and crying but the officer keeps asking if everything is okay she replies that everything is fine the officer finally gets in his car and leaves if i saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared i would want to at least get inside the house to investigate a little br br the ending is stupid as well while the woman in in the <UNK> she starts <UNK> and gets <UNK> excited so he starts walking around <UNK> his arms and <UNK> like a maniac she finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally <UNK> some more br br then the credits roll br br this is one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen nothing happens at the woman's house nothing br br i sometimes like campy films but this one really bored me br br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 good idea bad direction
<START> the name of this film and the clips that i saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments i was disappointed the desert <UNK> were interesting but this film along at a <UNK> pace it started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings as they found dead bodies or should i say <UNK> with some flesh on them they began a search for the reason why at times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert some type of black <UNK> or something that would begin to eat the flesh of humans as the flesh was <UNK> upon a bag of bones began to creep after the remaining humans the reason for this black <UNK> as we find out was pretty bad ants <UNK> then the ending made no sense i guess the <UNK> of this film will be when you have an <UNK> and see an <UNK> quickly kill it before the friends smell your flesh
<START> <UNK> documentary that tries to examine sci fi films of the 1950s and how they affected and reflected america steven spielberg george lucas <UNK> scott and james cameron are interviewed and mark <UNK> <UNK> br br pretty terrible the insights that are given are nothing new for instance the cold war and the threat of nuclear war affected a whole generation of children well duh they try to cover all of the different sub genres of sci fi films of the 1950s the big bug movies <UNK> from space movies etc etc that's good but they choose the most obvious films and they've been over <UNK> to death already it was cool seeing clips from x m destination moon forbidden planet the thing and the day the earth stood still but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious to any viewer that it's insulting even though it's under an hour i was thoroughly bored 30 minutes in this gets a 2 for some of the clips but nothing else
<START> no i'm not a radical bashing the <UNK> and <UNK> genre i just find it really boring and pointless my god i was made to watch this for <UNK> from some stupid punk and my my even an mst3k movie has a storyline not to mention that this <UNK> crap is what's giving anime a bad name world wide watch out sailor moon sadly people don't realize that not all anime or any other asian style is sleazy porn death to the stereotype br br starts casting
<START> with so many horrible spoof movies this is sadly a breath of fresh air to the genre compared to classics like airplane or the naked gun this is awful but compared to recent spoof movies like meet the <UNK> and disaster movie this is very clever and original don't get me wrong though this was not a good movie in any way i laughed a few times and there are a few inspired gags but any pop culture reference falls flat on it's face as does most jokes in the movie br br fields david <UNK> was a bad coach in the past but now he's brought back to teach college football and this time he'll do a good job his wife <UNK> <UNK> is feeling distant from him and his daughter is dating a football big shot to spite her father spoofs of various recent movies come into play as do a lot of sight gags and <UNK> stupidity br br the best parts of the movie are the gags not relying on reference to recent movies spoofs of radio rocky <UNK> friday night lights <UNK> and many other sports movies are not funny in the least it's mainly the smaller gags that get a few laughs like a bizarre <UNK> scratching scene or a chewing <UNK> spitting joke these little throwaway <UNK> cannot carry the movie and by the end it's hard to watch the last 20 minutes are <UNK> to sit through br br the characters are surprisingly developed for a sports spoof movie however i'm sure the characters were built on clichés from the genre nonetheless they're not too bad david <UNK> can pull lead actor in a movie off too bad they gave him so much crummy material to work with matthew has fine comedic timing in a not always so comedic role as a ballet dancing football player with a cross dressing father carl rounds off the cast once again playing in a sub par sports movie not the rocky movies happy <UNK> overall this is a goofy comedy at times it's funny but more often than not it's just very annoying and predictable br br my rating 1 2 out of 90 mins pg 13 for language sexual humor and drug humor
<START> being a fan of saint <UNK> and the city of london i was very excited to see this movie on the list of the <UNK> international film festival this movie has great shots an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a <UNK> so well london br br the movie is held completely in <UNK> colours which i personally don't like too much furthermore the narration was a little too british and the comments sometimes got a little flat other than that there are some great comments by <UNK> and excellent shots doesn't <UNK> london by showing all the great <UNK> of the city but rather gives deep insights in what london is really like from the east end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the <UNK> little for <UNK> br br all in all br br great soundtrack nice shots great insights br br narration to watch at times very dark picture br br worth watching i give it a 7 10
<START> i'm not the biggest fan of westerns my two personal favorites though are <UNK> and <UNK> this movie though i loved it was great the plot was well done and it was a fun movie everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent i even think it beat out both movies in <UNK> well not really <UNK> because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run i do think it beat out <UNK> though both had there strong points for instance they both had excellent well known casts very good plots and very good filming but <UNK> beat out <UNK> in four ways in my opinion first the characters were more unique in <UNK> the music was better in <UNK> the idea was original in <UNK> unlike <UNK> <UNK> and the biggest difference the action sequences oh my gosh <UNK> was a western with really good action sequences i mean really good the action was fast paced like modern day based <UNK> up movies the action had big budget explosions too the <UNK> were pretty good also mario van <UNK> was great in this movie i suggest buying this excellent movie
<START> perhaps i missed something but i found ghosts to be a tedious costume melodrama as to the story it was trying to tell i found that a confusing <UNK> mash that went off in all directions and perhaps it should have been made by a spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in <UNK> <UNK> english i can't judge the historical <UNK> of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar <UNK> <UNK> tragic fate plot line as girl with a pearl <UNK> was the movie a commentary on the religious <UNK> of the <UNK> false <UNK> torture then and now or what i never seemed to be able to figure that one out natalie <UNK> various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical and ultimately the movie was <UNK> with the <UNK> melodrama of a <UNK> head and body hanging on the edge of <UNK> heading off into the and <UNK> following along <UNK> <UNK> do better than that
<START> this was a strange film a bit horror and certainly film noir some fifth <UNK> meet and mysteriously start dying off with a japanese <UNK> in their hands after <UNK> <UNK> bela lugosi shows up br br soon the lone ranger arrives in the person of fbi agent richard martin <UNK> moore martin is <UNK> in finding the killer as he is more interested in the niece joan <UNK> of a missing doctor who is part of the gang br br after the last man dies and the doctor is horribly <UNK> by some strange serum the true story of the group comes out and that is where it gets interesting and weird i won't <UNK> it br br lugosi was marvelous as the <UNK> killer
<START> this is a film that revolves around two mysteries which i have now br br first did the film makers understand the concept of before using it to carpet bomb the audience throughout the film parody is when a <UNK> attempts to mock comment on or pay homage through self <UNK> humour to the original work in other words there should be reasons to parody such work and they should definitely be clever i didn't see any of those in the film i did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery bryan probably went to eric roberts and said hey i was drunk last night watching survivors and had this brain fart for a straight to dvd release i want you on board without reading the script because i plan to direct this film without one br br and <UNK> lies the second mystery eric <UNK> career i use to think eric roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky now i realize it's because he is stupid and therefore deserves the career that he had after watching this movie it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films which has higher budgets more intense scenes and roles better acting and direction more elaborate and compelling plot lines and a much wider audience than this b movie reject c movie
<START> this movie was so weak that it couldn't even come up with good cliches to rip off i love horror movies and will see practically anything but if i had it to do over again i would have <UNK> this one entirely you may think that i'm <UNK> but i challenge anyone to find anything even remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of garbage not scary not funny not curious not worth it
<START> help once again paul <UNK> has <UNK> his own intentions with dull <UNK> storytelling i <UNK> a vacation so that i could see this world premiere what a mistake why did <UNK> even want to make an exorcist film <UNK> intentions are fine but if i wanted 2 hours of <UNK> <UNK> i would visit my <UNK> sunday school father struggle with his faith as presented in his younger days is a potentially interesting subject but an exorcist movie needs more the relentlessly <UNK> presentation along with ridiculous special effects makes for a strange production who is this movie for i didn't bother seeing the <UNK> version but at least they apparently tried to deliver some sort of visceral thrills br br the exorcist series has been quite strange the first film was excellent but every sequel has been <UNK> and pointless why do they keep making them i suppose <UNK> made it so that he could get a lot of money but why should we go
<START> good film br br i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale <UNK> 99 seems like a good deal and it is thing is the film is named to kill for it took a little detective work to find out it's original name br br in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ability to sell having seen final destination 3 last night it in my view should have been a 18 br br maybe the fact the delightful <UNK> <UNK> is in it tends to make the <UNK> board step it up to 18 such a shame br br <UNK> is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions she ability to turn what is <UNK> a b movies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazing br br long live <UNK> <UNK> and her incredible talent as an actress
<START> the movie started off o k a couple of tourists on vacation in mexico having a good time decide they should go on a <UNK> they <UNK> some hidden <UNK> and end up and this huge temple like <UNK> angry villagers show up and try to <UNK> them from climbing it but because of the language <UNK> people get shot and the tourists end up climbing the stupid thing turns out the plants are evil blood <UNK> things that the villagers won't go near so they guard the temple so the tourists can't get off there are a couple of scares in this movie but nothing really makes sense i mean they're plants don't bother buying or renting the d v d wait till it comes out on cable
<START> this movie packs a punch there are a few every now and then that make me think deeply and <UNK> me a lot i could see myself in this same <UNK> <UNK> allowing things to happen around me not standing up for the right and decent thing just trying to avoid trouble how often do we avoid making waves or sticking our <UNK> out how often does our <UNK> <UNK> the evil actions of others we would never join them we tell ourselves we recognize that what they are doing is bad but do we do anything about it br br lawrence newman william h is a low key nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in brooklyn ny in the <UNK> days of world war ii he rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him has never married rarely just goes to work and cares for his <UNK> mother then a series of events in his very white little neighborhood pull him out of his <UNK> shell into a <UNK> of events it starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a puerto <UNK> girl by the son of his neighbor soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision as he is now better able to see he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life the one bright spot is a new love in his life and he marries hoping to continue on in his <UNK> then the <UNK> anti <UNK> on that street catches him despite his <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> as things spiral further out of control he discovers he must make an important decision does he take a stand or does he simply go away br br i cannot how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for post war anti <UNK> is the setting here but there is injustice at all times and in all places it is for the individual to decide where he or she stands
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a filmmaker i'm slowly getting into following the <UNK> efforts of deep red and <UNK> he's not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like plot that might be his one minor but for me apparent <UNK> he won't let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences as his killer s can go through any kind of elaborate set up of being invisible until revealing past the point of the <UNK> tracking shots of said <UNK> killer but it's thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway of a pure italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a <UNK> <UNK> in fact as a note of interest if one has recently seen the scorsese short film where he took three pages of an un filmed hitchcock film which also took place in an opera <UNK> had it beat by almost twenty years probably with no knowledge of the text it's also <UNK> 80s cd players and heavy metal and the hair oh my and with an absurdity that makes it all the more <UNK> to swallow br br the story is simple an opera of <UNK> is being produced with high stylized <UNK> and trained <UNK> there's even a talented up and coming star replaced at the last minute betty played by but a murder occurs during the premiere interrupted not by that but by a falling light and now the killer is after betty she can't go to the police how can she let out that the opera is really cursed but will that matter in the face of a killer who won't let up one has probably seen premises like this played out in other <UNK> films girl being chased by a killer but it's how <UNK> like de palma <UNK> and <UNK> his sequences and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor the <UNK> of the <UNK> to attack the killer and the subsequent version of pointing out in the <UNK> a kind of over <UNK> ala <UNK> the bullet through the <UNK> through the door probably inspired a similar shot in kill bill 1 and even <UNK> <UNK> inspiration with the <UNK> taped to <UNK> eyes more than once br br <UNK> puts his actress through the <UNK> and she's all game for it even when things seem to just go into <UNK> the <UNK> territory i was throwing up my hands almost saying i give up when she is led down the secret passage by the little girl as if suddenly we're in aliens now and through such dark genre material <UNK> keeps the violence thick and fresh the suspense about as much as that with opera music coming right out of a <UNK> of a <UNK> system and a cinematographer who may have had a few drinks and rightfully so during some scenes the way they're shot and <UNK> to a heart beat it should be considered trash but it's <UNK> past any limitations of the genre by the <UNK> attitude of the director this in spite of a silly ending <UNK> than anything that <UNK> what came before it thanks little lizard and an attempt to break the <UNK> curse which unfortunately didn't seem to happen in real life on the set of opera 8 5 10
<START> i've seen this movie times now and still can't get sick of it it's like a <UNK> drug i know a lot of people don't like it but there's something about it that just draws me in every single performance is spectacular but <UNK> is the one who steals the show she not only played the role of she became it her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well it's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an egyptian queen no i'm not against white people i am one true it's not known what color the ancient <UNK> really were but this was a nice change stuart <UNK> completely made me forget about tom <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> was striking once again all in all it was a good time at the movies for those who haven't seen it be sure to watch it with an open mind and not take it too seriously i mean it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star take it as that
<START> it's strange what fate does to some people while looking in the <UNK> bin at a dvd <UNK> i came across a copy of deadly instincts being a collector of any film that is either sci fi horror or featuring alien monsters i decided to buy it not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars  a bargain believe me after viewing it i came to the opinion that it was nothing special but after doing some research on the internet i discovered that the film was actually called was a remake of the tim <UNK> horror flick that <UNK> video stores in the mid 1980s which i've already seen my appreciation of deadly instincts grew following that discovery br br a <UNK> crashes on the lawn next to a private girls' college the sole teacher there ashley played by todd <UNK>  that's right the guy who gets turned into a cyborg in the cult flick cyborg cop four years earlier notices that some of the students are beginning to disappear while <UNK> a black haired woman with a <UNK> face wearing a kinky leather outfit his investigation reveals that an alien creature had <UNK> a ride on the <UNK> had come to earth to breed using the local <UNK> along with a local detective who believes him to be responsible for the <UNK> ashley tries to stop the monster br br the original directed by tim <UNK> who would leave the genre to make gay porn was a sci fi horror film which was actually a <UNK> <UNK> soft core porn film designed to take skin flicks to genre fans it is in my belief one of the worst films made in the 1980s why anyone would want to remake it is quite a mystery br br this remake is actually a better effort than its low budget source the film which takes the basic concept of an alien monster trying to <UNK> with human women <UNK> any pornographic elements in fact the film is actually very tame there are no sex scenes no nudity even during the shower scene swearing violence are kept to a minimal level there is no gore which may cheat <UNK> this makes the remake a film safe for the whole family that is if the kids aren't scared by alien monsters which brings me to the film's m 15 rating which seems a bit much br br of subject matter aside the film does have some faults the script while featuring some good characterizations has a number of holes so big you can crash a meteor through br br what you're mad at me for that come on this review needed a bad pun so it will remain interesting br br anyway the film's setting is one problem the script failed to fix  the film is set in boston but the buildings don't look like they belong in boston something about the architecture ain't right another thing is the college itself with a rather large building <UNK> about twenty students all female of course only having one class  art the only teacher there has a relationship with a student so does the janitor which somehow escapes the attention of the principal not to mention the cops who are so one dimensional stupid that the real boston <UNK> would have a good case if they ever decided to sue oh the well the chance that a meteor which is sent from <UNK> check the opening credits reaches earth with no <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> that doesn't include the chances that any passengers in the meteor will survive the landing br br as far as the acting goes todd <UNK> gives a <UNK> performance as the heroic teacher while the late simmons who was murdered by her boyfriend shortly before the film came out cuts a striking figure in that leather outfit as well as proving she can act the visual effects are run of the mill with credits due to the filmmakers for bringing us a cool looking monster
<START> i had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on tv it's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of <UNK> swiss cheese br br i would highly recommend this film as an example of how not to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yours br br i turned off the tv during the last ten hideous minutes of the show calling it pathetic is a gross understatement
<START> the bad dreams always come back again like <UNK> friends says marion who with her half sister laura lives in a vast mid victorian country estate and last night i found myself in normally people who are dead stay dead just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims but then there was nothing normal about what happened to us and we're off on a first class gothic story of madness deception and <UNK> based on <UNK> <UNK> great novel of victorian mystery it's a good idea to pay close attention because there are plots within plots yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves what else money lots of money br br marion tara fitzgerald and her sister laura <UNK> are devoted to each other marion is fierce and protective laura is <UNK> and much more romantic marion has no money of her own laura will <UNK> <UNK> when she comes of age marion has no marriage <UNK> that we know of laura has been <UNK> sometime ago to sir <UNK> james an altogether too charming aristocrat they are the <UNK> of their uncle a <UNK> condescending immensely self centered <UNK> ian richardson all seems to be quite routine but then a young artist walter andrew lincoln is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation and when he arrives at night to the local train station there is no <UNK> so off he sets out on foot to the estate in the dark woods he encounters a strange woman dressed all in white wandering about and speaking of things he does not understand who then disappears are we uneasy yes and so is he and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like laura later does love emerge between walter and laura does a bud bloom is there a <UNK> that sends walter away and results in laura marrying sir <UNK> does a <UNK> and do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among laura <UNK> and the woman in white do we learn to be deeply suspicious of sir intentions do we come to enjoy the style and manners of sir close friend count simon <UNK> and do we eventually realize the foul depths of <UNK> as well as the power of honor and true love that humanity is capable of do we visit victorian insane <UNK> see falls from high towers dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch <UNK> arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church br br well of course and it's a grand journey for us br br this bbc masterpiece theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values to fit <UNK> 500 plus page novel into a television show of less than <UNK> minutes means a good deal had to be cut or <UNK> and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available still taken on its own terms the production of the woman in white in my opinion works very well as a moody romantic dark television tale tara fitzgerald as marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister james as sir <UNK> manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the <UNK> <UNK> beneath the skin who still has charm amidst the <UNK> ian richardson as the young women's uncle almost steals the show he gives such a <UNK> and <UNK> performance it almost <UNK> the story every time he appears perhaps the weakest of the main parts is simon <UNK> as count the count is simply a monster yet a <UNK> <UNK> and charming one collins described him as being of immense <UNK> <UNK> does a fine mannered job of it but to me he lacks a little of the monstrosity of evil br br at one point <UNK> tells us my sister and i are so fond of gothic novels we sometimes act as if we were in them little did she know what was in store for herself and laura
<START> the film is excellent one of the most noteworthy things about it is that <UNK> performance is superb this is worth <UNK> as he was often <UNK> as an actor by bette davis et al br br i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn the cold <UNK> look on <UNK> face as he does so is extraordinary much better than the much <UNK> spencer tracy or many other stars could have done br br the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p <UNK> jr as lt <UNK> own butler it is <UNK> why he stopped making films shortly afterwards one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor
<START> randolph scott and glenn ford were once outlaw pals together but now scott's a sheriff and young ford is still hiring his gun out he gets hired to pull a bank job but is <UNK> getting to town and those that hired him get someone else that leads to all kinds of complications a lot for a film that's not even 90 minutes long br br randy and glenn both got girls here claire <UNK> plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold and evelyn <UNK> is the daughter of edgar <UNK> who falls for ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that scott is the sheriff in br br it's b western but unusual for the time and for columbia pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment the <UNK> marked glenn ford's first film in technicolor a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios harry <UNK> was certainly not one to shell out for it and definitely not during war time br br the plot gets a bit convoluted as both ford and scott are put to the test of friendship versus <UNK> duty the plot also involves some high class <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> town who are the real <UNK> as far as the film is concerned br br the four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is <UNK> williams as ford's lovable explosive <UNK> of a sidekick the climax involves a cattle <UNK> and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film br br fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one
<START> by <UNK> <UNK> br br i was kind of looking forward to this one i enjoy eddie murphy and i love it when a star hand makes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut but when the <UNK> head gets too big for the rest of his body there's always a danger of a big budgeted hollywood vanity production br br will the filmmaker keep it <UNK> or will he just waste amounts of money the <UNK> <UNK> and time the <UNK> <UNK> his own <UNK> himself on the back for an hour in a half sadly it's the latter here br br another thing i really like is when someone <UNK> new and fresh life into an exhausted and <UNK> out genre none of that here the <UNK> nightclub movies have become so worn through that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to death br br murphy does neither he does the most clichéd he <UNK> into a routine conventional formula gangster picture and plays it as seriously as if it were the godfather it's like a script where the next draft they put in the jokes and the new ideas but it seems like someone with <UNK> just looked at it and went <UNK> this is fine br br probably murphy he is credited all over this in the opening shot of beautiful white <UNK> sheets his name <UNK> across the credits about five times br br the plot a young orphan saves <UNK> life and <UNK> <UNK> the little br br 20 years later <UNK> dump has become a first class hot spot they're pulling down big money and a gangster wants their action he's even got a dirty cop in his employ but <UNK> comes up with a scheme a la the <UNK> br br murphy's screenplay plays like an unfinished first draft that nobody had the pair to call him on the actors aren't really allowed to stand out much if at all even the almighty murphy seems to be on auto pilot br br <UNK> shows class and <UNK> manners as sugar ray perhaps it would have been better to name his character brown sugar evidence that this one needed a polish but everyone here is basically just on vacation br br the oscar nomination the movie received is richly deserved joe i best costume design but the production values are the only part that makes the <UNK> feel authentic br br some sets look somewhat fake but this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts it's rare one movie gets nominated for both a <UNK> and an oscar unless it's one of <UNK> new star wars chapters br br it's 1938 and everyone is talking like it's 1988 particularly the comedians this is a <UNK> white man's formula and with all these black comedians and you expect them to <UNK> the genre or at least bring new life to it nope murphy is pretty much just <UNK> here br br the great roger ebert summed it up perfectly when he <UNK> in his review murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everybody gets to look great while <UNK> through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938 br br <UNK> guy is perfectly cast and seems to be <UNK> herself in her role and michael <UNK> has all the looks evil and mannerisms of the <UNK> mob boss down pat and there are moments where <UNK> gives you an idea of what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like he gives every scene he's in a feeling of dignity br br would it have been too much to ask that della <UNK> sing or at least quit embarrassing herself with all her kiss my ass talk br br and the late <UNK> foxx doesn't get to leave much of a <UNK> song here he has some back and forth with <UNK> which could have been some great stuff nope murphy wastes another opportunity again here br br murphy's quick is charismatic and likable but those moments are few and far between for sure murphy has never looked better and never been <UNK> his character made me laugh twice throughout the whole movie br br stan <UNK> boxer with a horrible speech <UNK> isn't just painful and embarrassing it's annoying there's more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant you have to <UNK> some kind of light touch and funny situation watching him strain even the some of the <UNK> words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed with murphy br br can murphy write a screenplay <UNK> there was raw but that was really stand up material he wrote the outline for <UNK> and coming to america for sure but her didn't have the last word there maybe a team of er like script doctors could've <UNK> this one br br murphy's direction is so slow and quiet you'd swear he was asleep at the wheel some of the time he has too many static shots and doesn't seem to know how to build and release suspense on some level i think quick is the real eddie murphy angry young hot headed and ambitious but occasionally charming now if he were only funny sometime br br there's a scene in which murphy has a femme <UNK> tale in bed who plans to make love with him and kill him you can probably guess how it turns out like everything else in the movie this could have been better br br surprisingly murphy has not directed another movie since he got a <UNK> nomination and he no longer writes the finished draft for his films either he won the <UNK> for writing this br br it's great to look at and the music is beautiful and there are a few really nice scenes but that just falls under the category of gems among all the junk not enough of them br br been been wasn't oh well br br by <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first off i have been a fan of the show back when my <UNK> station started showing it back in 1981 i learned many things about the show and the people who were in or contributed to the show br br this latest installment of doctor who made a great impression on me the original series aka classic series was made fun of by the bad special effects and or <UNK> sets well this is no more true the special effects are awesome but what is even better is the writing you get a chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why he loves the planet earth so much without giving too much away it is a very worthwhile series to watch christopher <UNK> brought a side of the doctor that we never get to see a bitter and angry one but yet lovable at the same time br br a must see
<START> when las vegas came out one review described this show as quote a harmless bit of fluff needless to say that after seeing a dozen or so episodes i think this description is right on the money an assortment of pretty boys and <UNK> model types play out an assortment of paper thin stories while all the time trying to pretend they are serious business people one dimensional characters in a one dimensional setting pursuing one dimensional stories that pretty much sums up vegas i still watch from time to time to see if the show is trying to <UNK> and take itself a little serious but alas to no <UNK> so far
<START> this is a fabulous film br br the plot is a good yarn and is <UNK> told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view what was deliberate and what was coincidence who is in love with who br br you get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn sometimes literally and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth br br with a bit of effort following the twists and turns you can understand each of the characters and key events in the film are <UNK> from the point of view of different people br br take the opportunity if it comes again to your <UNK> cinema it looks good on the big screen br br more than keeping you guessing the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds i defy anyone to predict br br but more likely you will need more than one viewing i saw this at the pictures on its original release three times and it got better each time br br the acting was very good with a standout performance by as alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble br br a classic the second best film of the 1990s
<START> in today's world of advertising and teenage horror and <UNK> it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it movies like psycho and blair witch while being great in suspense both with great build ups are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them with mute witness a rare treat i stumbled upon this film and watched it scared witless in the middle of the night i was scared by the menacing russian <UNK> the <UNK> theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the amusing which always leads to likeable characters could meet the end at any second since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations it also has fay <UNK> in a rare movie role watch and prepare to be excited scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways
<START> i saw this movie tonight in a preview showing and it was fantastic it does well in portraying issues that the average high school student is subjected to br br i left the movie feeling stunned and <UNK> and yet grateful that this movie will have a chance to raise awareness through its audiences regarding these issues bullying rape suicide and depression br br its a fantastic aussie film br br go see it br br support it br br learn from it
<START> take a few dark and <UNK> nights fog coming in from the coast obsession and doubt two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred a suspicious disappearance a shoe in the night <UNK> <UNK> out a glowing cigarette butt and finally a <UNK> heroine who finds herself threatened as much by her own doubts as by one but which one of the men around her sounds like we might have a good 80 minute noir instead under the direction of <UNK> minnelli and with two a list leads <UNK> hepburn and robert taylor <UNK> becomes a nearly two hour <UNK> melodrama a long <UNK> of threatening angst amidst the perfectly <UNK> and dressed cast when you glance at your watch half way through a movie and with a sinking heart see that you have another hour to go both you and the movie probably have problems br br minnelli in one of his earliest non musical movies doesn't lay on the <UNK> approach as heavily as he later was known to do still what is basically a simple story of greed murder and obsession is turned into an endless <UNK> hepburn vehicle hepburn shows us in carefully lit close ups how to demonstrate fear love anxiety <UNK> happiness doubt suspicion and terror robert taylor is more or less along for the ride br br hepburn starts the movie as the <UNK> ann hamilton an energetic young woman in <UNK> who helps her father with his <UNK> their <UNK> is determined to get her married when dr hamilton decides to sell an important formula to alan robert taylor it's love at first sight is the smooth handsome dynamic <UNK> of the distance <UNK> which was vital in the war and which has turned him into a hard <UNK> millionaire <UNK> he's a captain of industry as one of his many washington friends says ann hamilton now ann may still be a bit of the <UNK> but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social <UNK> for all those <UNK> and judges her husband knows she learns fast and eagerly they both are obviously and <UNK> in love br br but wait the is about to <UNK> ann realizes she knows nothing about her husband's family none of his employees or friends seem inclined to talk about them to her when she learns bit by bit that <UNK> mother died in the old family home in while <UNK> at the piano or that he has a brother michael who has disappeared alan becomes very quiet and sometimes goes into a rage he always <UNK> but wait once more did his mother really play the piano didn't she really die in bed wasn't michael caught taking money from the family firm and alan sent him away all this plays out against the exquisite hotel <UNK> the <UNK> country home in with the horse stable and the <UNK> ranch house by the sea everyone in the movie except employees are dressed to the <UNK> there are <UNK> cocktail parties and intimate <UNK> for twenty even in a black and white movie minnelli can't help but give us <UNK> tables filled with crystal and china <UNK> and elegant furniture and lots of <UNK> br br by the end of the movie when all is finally known when ann on <UNK> is chased along a high extremely well designed mountain trail by the bad guy on another horse when she is threatened with death by <UNK> and her <UNK> finally meets death by horse it's a relief even robert mitchum who plays michael is unable to bring much tension to the movie what might have been in lesser hands a taut little b movie instead with the a list is just an overwrought melodrama too big for its bones
<START> kramer vs kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget it isn't one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films but it does not mean it still isn't important i thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it the performances were the best positive for the film and dustin hoffman played one of his best roles he's ever done as the lonely <UNK> who has to take care of his son as his wife <UNK> from him billy who is <UNK> son played another great performance along with meryl streep playing the depressed mother of billy kramer vs kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10 but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it certainly one of <UNK> best films he's ever done i highly recommend it br br <UNK> <UNK> 9 10 a
<START> when you read about this film you wanna cringe i have seen it countless times and yet i cringe myself so what is the attraction here i think that for me it's the of the romance i find it super refreshing to have an oddball <UNK> between this nyc jimmy <UNK> like <UNK> and a down on her luck health wise <UNK> you feel embarrassed for paul sorvino at his <UNK> approach to <UNK> this woman like the guy in the bar who can't take a hint he's a bit overweight at least as a would be <UNK> for a <UNK> hope that doesn't sound <UNK> and possibly a tad too old for her nice change of pace from greek god <UNK> super model the bill <UNK> score has stuck in my head all these years later which is a pretty good sign however some of the acting is just dreadful a subplot involving a young puerto <UNK> boy <UNK> by <UNK> character is just hilariously bad but the opening scene where is warming up to carole king draws you right into this story good luck finding it you'd think that lifetime would be re airing this or even we but i haven't seen it on in quite a few years
<START> the opening scene really got me into watching the movie however not more than 5 minutes later i was already <UNK> my eyes out not only could i not understand a word that was said the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped the one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget however i didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two african americans but i guess anything is possible also why the hell was robin in the movie i'm not sure that it added anything artistically overall i would strongly recommend you jump off a cliff before you rent this movie
<START> this movie has a fairly decent premise one <UNK> featured again and again in science fiction films most spectacularly in alien and some decent he man performances from the male cast the possessed <UNK> wife to me is the weak link in the ensemble she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes for which i blame director corman br br given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play blood beast might have been pretty decent but the inherent <UNK> of the production design and the continuity errors and <UNK> <UNK> the proceedings for instance every time i saw the <UNK> astronaut laid out on an examination table the <UNK> of an <UNK> board i broke into <UNK> probably not the the emotion the crew wanted to <UNK> and the <UNK> costume needed some serious work <UNK> covered <UNK> just aren't scary or convincing br br still the premise was strong enough that i hung on to the end just to see how the plot would resolve itself and the <UNK> motives were <UNK> ambiguous at first that i could sort of think of it as an <UNK> and the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a bit of punch to it along with the plot development where the alien claimed to have <UNK> some of the dead man's personality br br it's corman it's cheap fast and mildly watchable if you don't think too hard or expect too much what more needs to be said
<START> this movie was sadly under promoted but proved to be truly exceptional entering the theatre i knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it br br i was caught off guard with the high quality of the film i couldn't image <UNK> <UNK> in a serious role but his performance truly <UNK> his character this movie is exceptional and deserves our <UNK> support unlike so many other movies it does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie but in this case i highly recommend that everyone see it br br this films is truly exceptional
<START> i watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out in <UNK> and it still made me laugh out loud it's <UNK> written kevin kline and joan cusack are both perfect in their roles and if you can look at bob <UNK> in this movie and not chuckle you're more of a man than i br br for that matter i think the scenes where tom <UNK> kisses kevin kline where kevin kline <UNK> to the how to be a man <UNK> and the post almost wedding scenes w joan cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie br br sure the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending but few movies are perfect
<START> to my eternal shame i've never seen a silent movie not even the mother of all vampire movies <UNK> however if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from buster keaton then i'll probably try to watch a few more this is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies the premise such as it is focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as keaton is mistaken for renowned bad guy dead shot dan co director malcolm st <UNK> this leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate keaton br br you're left amazed and entertained in equal <UNK> keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stunt man judging by the way he leaps and jumps around like jackie chan on speed and the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard my better half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much if you've never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch it certainly blew away any ideas i may have had about silent films naturally it isn't as polished as today's movies the acting is pretty awful truth be told but that doesn't matter because you're enjoying the movie regardless anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed brilliant
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> story surrounding a police department in <UNK> india is a hard working hard edged cop heading up a plain <UNK> crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than <UNK> them up in prison his loyal officers <UNK> him without question but a <UNK> forms when one of his officers <UNK> becomes frustrated by high <UNK> status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status a new <UNK> is also pushed into the <UNK> and <UNK> is angry when allows him to take the lead on his first case further change comes in the form of a new police <UNK> who <UNK> of tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics br br i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india the camera work is excellent the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds the acting pace and political <UNK> convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director <UNK> has taken liberties with factual accounts nevertheless <UNK> <UNK> is an extremely polished piece of film making
<START> especially after watching the matrix <UNK> spoilers br br after seeing the matrix with all it's ridiculous fantasy make believe robotic characters with their super powers it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk i cared about these people and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much it still left me feeling like it's possible <UNK> what a stupid video game like the matrix br br this movie isn't brain surgery it's very straight forward some things are predictable like knowing that someone is going to be a back and that someone early on is going to die pretty obvious but so what the first 15 minutes sets up our reason our motive our main objective br br i like that <UNK> and didn't have any make out scenes i am glad that they didn't go there they kept it about funny dialogue especially seth greene that guy is funny br br this is a movie that i would buy when it comes out on dvd it's fun fast and entertaining the only thing and i guess it's a big thing is that we are really rooting for the bad guys this group of are already on the wrong side of the law not a good message for the <UNK> parents please explain this to them br br
<START> oz is by far the best show ever to grace television better than the sopranos yes er yes <UNK> absolutely <UNK> daring and utterly disturbing yet profoundly moving oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever <UNK> up on television tom <UNK> truly did a brilliant job with the writing no topic is taboo rape drugs murder oz is evidence of just how good tv can be it follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races but always comes back to your <UNK> <UNK> in jail for <UNK> <UNK> we see what we don't want to see pain death mayhem oz will <UNK> you make you cringe make you look away but most of all it will make you think to see oz is to see a truly magnificent television production
<START> with david arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie well it is a stupid movie with a horrid script but the f x namely the eight <UNK> freaks makes this flick a hoot to watch a tribute albeit on the silly side to those great mutant creature features of the 50s arquette and sheriff sam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant <UNK> <UNK> havoc on their tiny town in arizona also in the cast are doug e doug rick leon and the charming scarlett johansson
<START> i'm sorry perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for <UNK> since <UNK> perhaps it's an old fashioned story perhaps it's not meant to knock your <UNK> off but i'm sorry this film is awful as in the title cliché <UNK> i think it has at least that many clichés it's a dreary story impressive managing to be dreary when there's dangerous fires and lives being saved about a <UNK> and his dreary life told in a pointless from <UNK> flashback to the past style we begin the film with the hero in peril in a <UNK> burning building the entire film is about trying to get us to love this guy so we squeeze a few tears out when he meets his end in the finale of the scene from the start of the film i found it hard to care and wished he'd gone up in smoke earlier clichés abound such as death of best friend love at first site <UNK> in a new job a worried wife with a husband with a <UNK> job a father figure boss superior 2 4 kids well 2 but close enough <UNK> your life to save others awards for bravery on and on it's every life every police officer nurse doctor in some way it was lazy if it was meant as a <UNK> flashing before his <UNK> as he died then god help the poor <UNK> i'm surprised he didn't suck in more smoke to go <UNK> the flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable <UNK> acted and with a soundtrack that could put the laughing cow out of business it was so cheesy it actually sounded like <UNK> or <UNK> free elevator stuff to be avoided at all costs unless you need something to watch with <UNK> of a sunday evening or maybe if your related to a <UNK> warning your life will end horribly or you will be <UNK> for life if you are a brave <UNK> according to this movie unless your john travolta strange style hair in this one
<START> after five years in prison tony le jean meets his <UNK> friends jo carl and the italian mario robert <UNK> and they invite tony to steal a couple of <UNK> from the show window of the famous jewelry <UNK> <UNK> but he <UNK> tony finds his former girlfriend marie who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night club <UNK> <UNK> or louis pierre and he <UNK> her beating on her back and taking her <UNK> then he calls jo and mario and <UNK> a <UNK> of the safe of the jewelry they invite the italian <UNK> in and elegant wolf <UNK> <UNK> to join their team and they plot a perfect heist they are successful in their plan but the d juan <UNK> makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his mistress br br du <UNK> <UNK> les is a magnificent film noir certainly among the best i have seen the screenplay has credibility supported by an awesome direction of jules <UNK> stunning performances of the cast and great cinematography jean has outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the underworld rules the famous long silent sequence of the heist is amazing and extremely tense and certainly among the best ones of the cinema history i am listing this great movie in my list of favorite movies ever my vote is ten br br title brazil <UNK>
<START> historically awful <UNK> an accurate moment in 4 hours of one cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching as with all track and <UNK> movies nobody bothers to ask for any track <UNK> events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown from the shots of <UNK> <UNK> in a 400 <UNK> to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the la <UNK>
<START> human traffic is without a doubt the most original and compelling film that i have seen for a long time it documents 2 days in the lives of a group of young people bored with their everyday existence and dead end jobs and taking ecstasy at <UNK> on the weekend it is hilariously funny and extremely poignant and at times very sad in the same genre as <UNK> it has a great soundtrack and features hot young rising british stars the movie was made on a <UNK> budget and i look forward to future offerings of writer director justin <UNK> when his talent is discovered by the major movie makers
<START> thankfully brief mystery about a <UNK> <UNK> who is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a <UNK> <UNK> the discovery brings about an attempt on her life which is <UNK> by charlie as a crime <UNK> things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title location and another attempt is made on the girls life your enjoyment of this film will depend upon your tolerance for and his nonsense i normally like but there was something about this role that <UNK> me the wrong way actually i think it didn't help that the mystery wasn't very good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you watching yes the finale on the train was exciting but it didn't make up for everything that went before not worth searching out but if you stumble upon it give it a try
<START> this new installment to the child's play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a <UNK> witnessing <UNK> him the finger and saying rude f king doll and lots of references to the series you can kill me but i'll come back i always come back the movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it this is totally different from all other films in the series it doesn't even have andy the central character for all the previous ones <UNK> seems to <UNK> with characters from another movie a soap opera about two teens running off together to get married there is one cool elaborate death scene involving broken glass and water <UNK> everywhere the movie is very gory very funny and has pop culture references from martha <UNK> to jerry springer do not see this one before you see the other three it will really ruin the effect since the first one is truly scary lots of guilty pleasure fun and silliness br br
<START> i've never expected too much from a film by trashy b movie director jim <UNK> a silly premise some <UNK> effects and a bit of nudity from some <UNK> babes and i'm usually fairly happy br br well <UNK> massacre delivers on the former and definitely the latter but unfortunately is a tad light when it comes to the splatter and when a film has the word in the title and on the gore then <UNK> we have a problem br br movie <UNK> on a group of <UNK> who along with their teacher mini bus driver and a couple of guys become stranded in the mountains during a <UNK> they make their way on foot to a deserted mountain <UNK> where they find food and shelter and a crazy killer who wants them all dead from the outset good old jim <UNK> that his film features plenty of scenes loaded with t a and includes the obligatory shower scene along with numerous other moments in which tasty women get <UNK> including a spot of raunchy <UNK> sex and a very gratuitous three babes in a hot <UNK> scene none of the women look young enough to be <UNK> and are never even seen in their outfits but who cares about such details when they're all too willing to strip off in the name of art br br i do care however about the movie's numerous <UNK> deaths with such an extremely lurid title i had been hoping for some inventive <UNK> to go with all of the <UNK> bush and boobs instead practically all of the killings occur off screen or feature next to no gore only a silly post <UNK> scene achieved with cheap as <UNK> cgi comes anywhere near to delivering the goods br br still if you're feeling in the mood for some <UNK> or a bit of slasher silliness minus the <UNK> then at <UNK> minutes at least <UNK> massacre won't be too much of a waste of your time
<START> this movie was of the <UNK> of <UNK> best pictures i have seen by far the worst first of all i found the plot line somewhat absurd the absent husband for 25 years still in love not even a letter give me a break and why was the guy who was absent for so long <UNK> working on an oil <UNK> next door to the <UNK> woman's party this film also <UNK> some of the worst stereotyping of african americans that i have ever seen it makes gone with the wind see <UNK> look downright <UNK> i have <UNK> seen a movie that i disliked this much ugh
<START> that's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer's intelligence by losing track of time plot and reason for being produced br br plus how that guy with the glasses ever got a gig in hollywood is beyond me
<START> writer director michael <UNK> sci fi channel sequel to stan <UNK> classic horror tale of revenge gone awry has its moments and some decent gore but ultimately falls short in comparison to the original br br i'm pretty sure the filmmakers weren't trying to make a comedy but i caught myself laughing throughout a family <UNK> started over a car accident is the basis for this entry into the franchise the <UNK> and mccoy families live in a backwoods town with dirt roads drive pickup <UNK> drink <UNK> and kick each others <UNK> every chance they get just when they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily ever after jodie <UNK> amy <UNK> and ricky mccoy <UNK> taylor decided to fall in love causing the fit to hit the <UNK> one night the two <UNK> decide to head out into the woods for some quality time while <UNK> sister plays <UNK> but it just so happens that on that very night some of the accidentally kill <UNK> sister and catch him and jodie together you know what happens next ricky finds his sisters body and decides to pay a visit to <UNK> so that he can exact his revenge through the mighty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> lance <UNK> is back to warn potential damned souls against using <UNK> to ease their pain which really put a <UNK> in the story because <UNK> is supposed to have called on <UNK> years before this story takes place but the setting and characters look like dirty <UNK> that somehow traveled through time in order to bring the pickup truck back to <UNK> then there's the sheriff rob freeman who has his own ties to the demon and looks like he belongs in a 70's revenge movie instead of a made for cable horror flick br br some of the gore and special effects were cool but instead of sticking to the man in a suit way of thinking <UNK> used some terrible looking 3d shots for certain scenes one particularly embarrassing shot shows <UNK> jumping from tree <UNK> like a badly rendered 3d monkey the cinematography was exceptional and <UNK> the quality of the movie quite a bit the acting was pretty decent also with the exception of a few poorly executed accents br br family <UNK> never end well especially when the families involved in the <UNK> have to deal with <UNK> i didn't enjoy every minute of this flick but it was much better than most of the movies the sci fi channel <UNK> out maybe it's a sign that the channel is trying to bring the quality of its movies up to match the quality of its original <UNK> i wouldn't waste any <UNK> on a rental but if you get the chance to catch a <UNK> of it on the <UNK> tube i would say to check it out it's a not so killer film but it rises slightly above the level of trash that makes it onto dvd these days
<START> too much stock footage almost one third of this <UNK> minute film really slows this one down granted that the plot is that john <UNK> john wayne is sent by marshall george <UNK> george hayes to participate in a fixed <UNK> say <UNK> day oh but character development and interaction are sacrificed the relationship between the bad girl usually a <UNK> even in the great duck soup 1933 and the <UNK> polly ann young a loretta young look alike hey it's her sister could have <UNK> from more screen time the happy ending is too abrupt although this time john wayne actually kisses the girl br br the most interesting stock footage was the lengthy <UNK> parade of real indians and but when the best part of the movie is the stunt work by the mighty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who gives us jumping from one horse to another and several different running leaps onto a horse you know we're in trouble as noted by others the final fight with the villain is very poorly done br br my copy from disc featured an added sparse ill fitting pseudo classical <UNK> music track that ruins the authenticity of the original film the dvd box had audio 5 <UNK> on it if you're going to <UNK> and <UNK> it you should add a <UNK> sounding score with <UNK> <UNK> and an <UNK> br br finally we have to say this is one of the weakest lone star efforts
<START> anyone who has spent time working in a hospital or medical facility has got to appreciate this film the plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from start to finish the acting is superb george c scott is the brilliant doctor but class a failure as husband father diana <UNK> a sex symbol of the 1960s and 1970s of the <UNK> saves him from himself the surrounding cast is superb and the dialogue quite entertaining i think i enjoyed the film more on viewing it the 4th <UNK> or <UNK> time because i caught that much more of the <UNK> of the dialogue and the interplay of the characters well worth seeing again and again you just won't want to check in to a hospital in the near future
<START> well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because well you never know here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h t spells essentially what happens here is a total <UNK> of dr <UNK> classic it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money if that was a subplot then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and the cat plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie
<START> this movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost only with this movie it truly is a near miss everything seems in place for <UNK> 2 to be a worthy <UNK> to the groundbreaking first movie the complete original cast apart from the <UNK> naturally returns and gives it their best too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as <UNK> their efforts br br <UNK> <UNK> might have been the ideal go to guy for george lucas to direct the empire strikes back for a pedestrian filmmaker like <UNK> there isn't much to ruin in <UNK> <UNK> film series a worthy <UNK> to a classic like <UNK> would have needed either paul verhoeven to return or a director with enough <UNK> to give his own spin on it <UNK> doesn't know how to give his own spin on anything lucas hired him for that and he's surely no verhoeven br br so what we get here is a movie that goes through all the motions to <UNK> the first movie but with none of the <UNK> humor or daring the original had <UNK> probably thought he could top verhoeven by adding more gore and gratuitous violence but instead he reveals how much he was at work as a director for hire instead of a passionate filmmaker and that's a shame since everything was in place to make this another classic as mentioned the actors give it their best but delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story by frank miller who was born to write a <UNK> movie if only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through
<START> the book was one of stephen king's best the movie was pure rubbish it was painful to remain in the theater until the ending which wasn't even the same as the book i guess that this is the result when you try to <UNK> 10 pages of story into every minute there is no good reason to watch this movie
<START> my interpretation is that the term is used in the sense of the opposite of people who are not warm toward others the film reminds me of the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> in 'the art of <UNK> where his main point is that the key to happiness is connecting with others not only are the characters in the film <UNK> but they are also <UNK> <UNK> shy quiet and <UNK> these characteristics appear to prevent them amongst other things from <UNK> and enjoying relationships and being able to talk about and deal with their problems and as a result they are terribly unhappy i see it as a strong <UNK> of the <UNK> teaching i'm not a <UNK> by the way if you are one of the people who thinks that their behavior is a natural response to living in a large city then i think you may be right but i recommend the <UNK> book city life need not be like this br br i can see why some people found it boring it does drag a bit in places and the characters are not particularly likable and it does contrast to lost in translation where the <UNK> characters are much more likable and do connect with one another even though they don't connect with people generally
<START> one of the worst excuses for an irish accents i've heard from a truly great actor too its a bad irish accent not to mention a <UNK> accent which is completely different anyway the film is loosely based around the story of <UNK> martin <UNK> and its done much much much better with brendan <UNK> in the title role in the general
<START> the king of queens could be divided into two <UNK> br br the first era <UNK> of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck br br the second era <UNK> the scope of the show addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin br br but besides all of that br br this show was freaking hilarious br br kevin james when not doing crap comedy films with adam sandler is a genius of laughter and his chemistry with <UNK> was <UNK> on tv br br jerry stiller as the psychotic live in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor and <UNK> as the man child <UNK> was amazing he's a great comedian too the king of queens was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air and it's a damn shame now all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of <UNK> actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance i like many fans of actually funny tv shows am now in a state of mourning
<START> whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never <UNK> any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography i've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in <UNK> and <UNK> to her later years with <UNK> i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those <UNK> people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> jr i would be <UNK> at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me
<START> this western musical comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen i found it much too slow it just <UNK> along to the inevitable end i also found it disjointed i couldn't wait for it to be over randolph scott is the <UNK> here and lloyd bridges also stars but for my money money edgar <UNK> is the best of the bunch <UNK> appeared in many westerns in his day many times providing comic relief as he does in this picture i also liked ann <UNK> as rita otherwise though i can't think of much to recommend this movie the movie is based on a novel by ernest who also wrote the novel <UNK> which was mad into a movie of the same name in 1939 and remade in 1966 and again in 1986 the 1939 version of <UNK> is in my mind one of the best movies ever made anyway as for town my vote is a 3 10
<START> this movie is so dull i spent half of it on imdb while it was open in another <UNK> on netflix trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the more boring <UNK> <UNK> films they've ever seen a warning i actually could not finish it so these are my impressions up to minute <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> gets loads of screen time as others have mentioned her mother penned the script perhaps during some sort of drug induced <UNK> <UNK> utter <UNK> and <UNK> statements about emotions sounded like interesting dialogue and it seems that the film is a showcase for <UNK> <UNK> although i agree she is lovely with her teeth her <UNK> teeth cause me anxiety and fear i found her reactions forced and poorly timed as in william or dylan does something cute pause <UNK> from k with <UNK> and a playful arm <UNK> like a minute too late what and she cannot match cillian murphy's intensity he somehow manages to really look at her and look as though he is fascinated by her and falling in love with her whereas she seems totally <UNK> almost like she is <UNK> with a mirror that must be torture acting opposite someone who isn't delivering the same level of energy as you know what else is torture this movie br br <UNK> does look stunning during her <UNK> i've got 1940s pin <UNK> and a hot dress watch me sing shots but what's the point is she an <UNK> or an actress when she talks it's bizarre ya going this makes me confused because the accent is so mixed up and yet so thick at times i have no idea what she's saying or maybe fell asleep if no one knows who vera was or cares or few do was it so important to give her this supposed <UNK> accent it <UNK> from all the rest of the action just kidding there br br this movie seems like someone <UNK> a movie maybe after reading a little dylan thomas before bed but instead of adapting to the waking world was like man that dream was so interesting and tried to <UNK> it then someone else <UNK> your script needs work nothing that happens <UNK> a story or creates necessity and the writer is all but that's the way i <UNK> it it's like the rambling fantasy of a child one of those wild and meandering <UNK> they spin to get your attention and then william went to a war and then vera had a baby and then some blond chick <UNK> too much and there were so many <UNK> and pin <UNK> and everyone had ruby red lips and br br as for the dylan thomas character so bland that's all i can call him why didn't he have any lines in this goofy biopic all he does is drink beer and smoke <UNK> and roll around with <UNK> miller who is so wild and artistic she'll do a <UNK> in public get outta here you crazy <UNK> i realize she is not a poet but she and thomas are like this one nauseating unit of crazy guys crazy times like a <UNK> sailor and from wild at heart someone asks in the message board if they should buy this film i say do it leave it on your shelf and only <UNK> it as a weapon to children the elderly or lingering house guests br br p s to murphy's character when someone asks if you were in the sh you can say yes because your war scenes appear to have been shot at a <UNK>
<START> this really is by far the worst movie i've ever seen in my whole life i'm approaching <UNK> the description on the back of the cover <UNK> the <UNK> text right at the begin of the movie the further plot was <UNK> and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their acting i viewed the full length of it and was really <UNK> when the final character's death <UNK> the end of my suffering the location was either some kind of <UNK> or a <UNK> beach i suppose that home video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub standard the dialogues were uninspired and devoid of meaning as were the actors faces which brings me to the topic make up by the looks of it they got it as gimmicks in some teen magazines my first own make up or similar what made me buy the dvd was the name <UNK> <UNK> on the cover the only connection with this brilliant <UNK> works was the use of the name <UNK> which was wrongly translated as book of light the 4 70 euro i paid for this dvd were a complete loss for the dvd went into the <UNK> box without any further <UNK>
<START> they make everything too easy in this film it sort of reminded me of indiana jones where he hides on the outside of a submarine during an ocean crossing everybody knows everything that's going on it's just real easy to get <UNK> you want in the white house i don't even know why i watched half of it because i like charlie sheen and donald sutherland i expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from every angle and be able to run faster than a motorcycle usually it's faster than a car in a garage or a it was silly mostly and i didn't even know then had a ten story elevator in the white house anyway anything <UNK> is always interesting
<START> we were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here well we got it home and could not believe what we saw its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help <UNK> his sexual <UNK> and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor the main character is all over the place one moment he is like an immature little kid the next moment he is mature and intelligent then heroic then a perverted stalker br br the worst part is all of the out of place sexual content i have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy but this is just presented in a way that is creepy <UNK> slips close ups of a girls <UNK> many times in white <UNK> or a <UNK> it was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters br br we were expecting something of a mature nature but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was besides <UNK> cartoon boobs and poor dialogue if you want to see some cartoon characters <UNK> and this is for you if you are looking for something beyond that this movie was empty the characters and dialogue were just plain irritating br br
<START> in 4 words captain <UNK> was completely out of tune with the book the novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome the script writer chose to ignore the details in ignoring them e g the <UNK> role initially as a <UNK> but later as a spiritual leader the <UNK> inability to read until taught by a <UNK> rebel the bomb experts advice to and his eventual ironic demise the story and characters fall flat br br this was the first movie that i've ever walked out of <UNK> through interesting cinematography great actors do not make a film the story does
<START> father hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling father who is definitely a hood patrick <UNK> plays jack charles who is a hood always on the look out for the one big score that is going to put him on easy street his wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care when he got out he thought they were probably better off in foster care  besides he still had to score his fortune his daughter kathleen charles played wonderfully by sabrina lloyd breaks out of a foster care institution that is <UNK> the kids and money that is suppose to be being spent on the kids she <UNK> down her father tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother eddie charles played by brian <UNK> just a little 7 year old kid was being moved to the institution that she had just broken out of and convinces her father to kidnap him the three start off on an adventure across country all the while jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids patrick <UNK> is really good in this comedy playing a hood probably a little understatement for this criminal character who is similar to his johnny castle character of dirty dancing except jack is appropriately funnier in this comedy and more optimistic than johnny castle <UNK> is funny and <UNK> does comedy pretty well <UNK> <UNK> plays kathleen <UNK> who is a reporter trying to get at the truth of the foster care system who becomes ally diane <UNK> plays rita the con artist mother of jack charles
<START> this film truly was poor i went to the theatre expecting something exciting and instead was <UNK> the opportunity to <UNK> my guess the next plot twist before it happens skills seriously the plot was written with an extra thick <UNK> so everyone could see nothing was truly shocking in fact even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add up to much br br the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony and the scene where <UNK> character is struggling with the clues and reaches his <UNK> <UNK> goes to great <UNK> to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience little br br probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the x files treatment every building in the film whether it's the <UNK> building or a house at <UNK> or a hospital was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting not to mention a lack of in the case of the hospital i don't recall a single scene when someone <UNK> on a light switch it sure would have been nice br br mr <UNK> really isn't an oscar grade actor so i suppose you have to take this film for what it's worth in the end i've reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching the warriors otherwise you're left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as silence of the <UNK>
<START> i haven't seen every single movie that burt reynolds has ever made but this one which i've just finished watching for the third time may very well be his best it suffers only from some slow stretches burt perhaps tried to make it more arty than it should have been on the other hand he managed to avoid many of the usual cliches in the presentation of the tough cop role he plays notice for example the scene in which he attempts to kiss rachel ward for the first time or the fear he expresses just before the final showdown with the <UNK> henry <UNK> in fact <UNK> and those two ninja <UNK> are three of the most memorable villains of cop thrillers of the 80s the film also has some offbeat touches a surprising amount of humor a brutal and gripping <UNK> and many well directed shots
<START> it s funny how instinct warns you of something for example as soon as the company credits read <UNK> image i knew <UNK> i d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but <UNK> t remember where nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was maybe i m psychic br br mild spoilers br br the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time i don t know about you but i m <UNK> slightly fed up with <UNK> violence <UNK> nowadays along with bad language especially if it s <UNK> by actors as bad as the ones in this movie anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to <UNK> revenge on the man who shot his wife oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night yeah he s a serious <UNK> <UNK> in fact he s so bad and i don t mean the acting i ll get to that in a moment that he s impossible to take seriously and this is before he s executed only to return as <UNK> john elvis a french chef etc i wonder if keith david got paid for this because he looks he s having so much fun on screen that s the only reason he s playing the role what a pity this reviewer <UNK> t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury hey maybe the producers could send me keith s <UNK> <UNK> only knows i deserve it br br i disliked this movie a lot as if you t guessed and my main <UNK> <UNK> t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence if like me you <UNK> had a wine bottle <UNK> over your head or been kicked in the <UNK> very hard several times you ll know violence is an obscene painful thing but judge and jury will have you believe that if you re thrown through a window crash through some and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be <UNK> but you ll be able to <UNK> a couple of <UNK> devil dogs it could of course be <UNK> that any film starring sly arnie or bruce also suffers from this same <UNK> showing of violence but with judge and jury it <UNK> my chain
<START> appalling shallow <UNK> nonsense how women and gay men can enjoy this rubbish is beyond me no self <UNK> man would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold <UNK> what is even more concerning is that so many reviewers say they relate to the women on the show if that is the future of women lord help us all showing your independence and being respected as equals with men should not be about <UNK> your legs every three seconds with a different man i think this <UNK> women and does not do them justice but this review is no rant against women fans of this show say it is hilarious and but every time i have watched this show i have just <UNK> to stay awake despite the narrative of the reporter woman at no point in this show is there even anything close to something that could be considered a rational thought so it's not entertaining and it's not informative so why would you bother watching it one out of ten stars
<START> this <UNK> middle class sitcom became the subject of much hatred by the new breed of talented comedians in the 1980s such as ben <UNK> did it deserve such <UNK> well terry and june was never clever it was never a well written tale with different threads which <UNK> at the conclusion it was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched they <UNK> rather than laughed but they were never likely to be offended by the show so the fact that it never challenged them was <UNK> br br one foot in the grave suffered initially because it appeared at first sight to be just another terry and june br br a few days after the death of terry scott an episode was broadcast on <UNK> tv and that has been its final outing there have been few repeats of the show on any tv channel br br thankfully tv comedy has advanced since terry and june it's hard to find kind words for it terry scott did make the best of weak scripts
<START> i loved this movie i saw it when i was about 8 years old and almost seven years later this evening i got to see it again i really thought it had an interesting idea they only thing that upset me was the ending which i felt was a cop out <UNK> here it's hard to find this movie and i was lucky enough to have seen it on bravo i also expected to see more drew barrymore in here too
<START> i finally managed to sit through a whole episode of this show i was very very tired clearly previously i would always have to turn it off because i thought it was that bad watching a full episode convinces me that it really is that bad i couldn't even tell you what happened but i <UNK> remember not laughing for people who think this is the new all in the family or married with children have you ever actually watched those shows they are well written and well acted and most importantly funny this show is not funny you might think so if this is the first sitcom you have ever watched i cannot see who else would i echo all previous sentiments about arrested development etc it's probably my own fault for getting frustrated with television and not watching it thereby allowing the stupid people to <UNK> what actually stays on the air
<START> i think that key west might do well as a dvd there probably are a lot of failed star <UNK> that just never had a chance to succeed we will never know if this could have been a great series i would love to know if there is a way to see older shows like this or are they just another hollywood <UNK> is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we loyal <UNK> can enjoy them again the show had a great writing talent and some if not all of the episodes left you with a feel for the characters that is often missing in todays hit shows i often came away with a sense of learning something from the story lines and greatly entertained by the very unique characters thank you
<START> ok this movie was the worst display i have seen in years the actors weren't to bad i figured it was a b movie so they were doing b movie acting anyways i watched this movie thinking oh cool a <UNK> sci fi movie wrong it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people the last scene was extremely messed up that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something what someone believe in is a matter of opinion this movie just shows how <UNK> religion is especially christianity br br if you want to watch a b movie this ain't if you want to watch a movie that is trying to <UNK> the masses well this is the pick of the <UNK> go right for it if you are going to convey a message do it don't force it ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such a degree especially christians
<START> david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gave an outstanding performance as a <UNK> in almost everything he did or said if he had a cocktail he always had a <UNK> to <UNK> the excess on his mouth with unbelievable perfection you could just view the expressions on the <UNK> face and see that he never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior the beautiful falls colors through out the english countryside was simply breath taking <UNK> <UNK> bait 2000 gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from mr <UNK> a very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of david <UNK> as mr <UNK>
<START> oh man where to even begin br br dropping your gun to get in hand to hand combat w a zombie while holding a bitten soldier down <UNK> to shoot him <UNK> he turns then he turns and bites the person holding him down turning your back on a fallen zombie continuously shooting the chest and seeing it doesn't work so they shoot the chest some more having the idea that a kid <UNK> at a desk w blood coming out of his mouth is still alright walking along a football field like nothing is wrong then all the sudden <UNK> the zombie football team doing whatever in the middle of the field like they couldn't have been seen up to that point br br i could go one for a few more hours but you get the point childish writing and dialog bad directing horrid special effects truly sad and undeveloped storyline zombie <UNK> campus must get the <UNK> host then lose it twice the only plus i can find is that this one doesn't include clips of the actual game during the action scenes br br id say don't waste your money but id be more upset about the waste of time i saw it on cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back
<START> an especially delightful film to those of us who saw this when young because after all it was meant for the young to watch when viewing it again as an adult it's better if rose <UNK> <UNK> can kick in it was the first of the 16 jungle jim films and later tv series <UNK> johnny <UNK> went on to do for columbia in the last 3 films he had to use his own name though as they'd lost the rights after getting the sack from playing tarzan for <UNK> lesser johnny <UNK> also gave up playing boy to become <UNK> the jungle boy in a series of 12 films br br jim and party go on <UNK> <UNK> to hunt down the hidden temple of <UNK> by an obscure tribe of devil doctors who seem to have the secret of a poison that might also be a cure for edgar rice <UNK> probably <UNK> after 16 years talking <UNK> seemed awkward <UNK> sentences together not that it <UNK> on the swift march we meet many of the interesting but generally playful <UNK> of the jungle <UNK> the sinister crocodile going to eat the leading lady with her leg caught under a <UNK> and the surreal elephant <UNK> stock footage <UNK> into a corner of the frame <UNK> the dog and <UNK> <UNK> the crow had many adventures none of which turned out essential to the plot in case you were <UNK> the biggest problem with the film is the <UNK> climax which can be exciting but also unfortunately remind you of the end of a serial part  and the original excellent serial had been made 12 years prior although personally i wouldn't have minded this going on another couple of hours as well br br the only thing heavy about this was <UNK> in so many ways an enjoyable kids film from the old days not recommended for serious adults so i love it
<START> anthony quinn is a master at capturing our heart and sympathy he portrays a romanian <UNK> with a below average iq <UNK> by his wife to do more it's wwii and the nazis have taken over his country soon he finds himself digging <UNK> hoping to benefit himself in his wife's eyes the nazis have different ideas through the next years we watch events unfold through his naive eyes but all he wants to do is go home his <UNK> and ill luck just get him in further hot water finally through no fault of his own we see his picture on the cover of der <UNK> as the perfect <UNK> the war ends and the allies put him on trial for war crimes but all our <UNK> wants to do is return home to his wife
<START> there's not much anyone can say about this flick the plot is quite simple two police officers who also happen to be lovers are using a <UNK> as a <UNK> in order to catch a criminal with the help of the lady of the house played by hardcore chloe as anyone can guess there's a few plot twists and some <UNK> <UNK> but the writing was just horrible even for a <UNK> movie br br i've read some previous <UNK> about nicole accent she plays the female cop yes it's hard to understand what she's saying at times but i think i've placed it i did some <UNK> around i think she's from germany hence her odd sounding accent she makes an impression even without speaking however she's got a great looking body br br there were a couple of from behind sex scenes in this movie that were quite graphic for a <UNK> film excellent work there the three way scene toward the end wasn't bad either br br spoiler alert br br i kinda knew the female cop was gonna turn into a part time call girl at the end she enjoyed her three way way too much br br end spoiler br br i'm not gonna <UNK> about the story too much seeing as this is a low budget direct to video <UNK> flick however it just seems like i've seen way too many movies in this genre with a similar type of storyline br br women b chloe and were okay as the eye candy sex b scenes were kinda short but good story c a recycled plot but whatever works eh overall b
<START> having been a faithful <UNK> fan all of my life i have to say that <UNK> and the <UNK> is probably the most well done of all the <UNK> films its got some very funny jokes in it and the animation is superb as many people have pointed out it doesn't really follow the plot of the comic <UNK> and the very closely but in many ways that's just as well because that book stands out in my mind as one which <UNK> a great deal of fun at the culture of the sixties and much of it is very dated today br br what really <UNK> me the wrong way though is how they <UNK> a disney style plot into the film which took much of the focus away from <UNK> and we have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit in we have a tom boy girl who doesn't fit in because she wants to be treated as equal to men <UNK> they meet and fall in love but their love is threatened because boy is ashamed to be totally honest with girl but in the end their love wins out this has been the plot of so many disney and be fair other studios too films that its not funny and the plot was old twenty years ago i mean they even gave a whimsical animal sidekick br br not only did i find this derivative and clichéd but it really <UNK> from the story and left me <UNK> br br i think that it speaks volumes about how superb the rest of the movie was that i still think very highly of it despite the way the plot got <UNK>
<START> i've never seen the original house of wax so i really didn't know what to expect when i went to a sneak preview of the new film after a somewhat <UNK> start introducing our young characters house of wax shifts <UNK> and becomes an extremely effective horror outing br br the plot really doesn't matter too much here i think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax it's all about the special effects here and they are top notch viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be satisfied here but there are other <UNK> effects as well the production design and sets are excellent and the cast makes the most of their under written roles br br of course many people are probably wondering just how paris <UNK> performance is to be honest hilton <UNK> herself quite well and she doesn't portray herself as so many people are <UNK> her character is sexy and sweet and i think her good work will hopefully change a lot of people's opinions about her elisha <UNK> is also good moving up from her previous movie the atrocious the girl next door her character is put through a lot and <UNK> proves to be a <UNK> heroine <UNK> michael murray like hilton and <UNK> is pretty to look at but unfortunately is not very convincing as the bad boy of the group br br i predict good things for house of wax as the audience at the screening i attended <UNK> screamed and <UNK> through out many parts of the movie <UNK> to the cast and crew for a job well done br br and a <UNK> to paris hilton for proving a lot of people wrong like she always says that's hot
<START> john cinematic interpretation of edith ethan falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece while the story is <UNK> the elements that give the <UNK> its soul are <UNK> and all in all lost in the film <UNK> fails to convey the innocence and overall tragedy of ethan and relationship instead <UNK> it into a morality tale the mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog <UNK> in the book is almost completely the antagonist the books least sympathetic figure where in the movie she can be almost <UNK> though it's a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on the book more accurately describes <UNK> control of the house and of ethan the movie just <UNK> me off the addition of the fox was pointless as well as the scene with <UNK> trying to kill herself it was just poorly interpreted and done film mistakes <UNK> <UNK> in the church dance scene interactions with denis addition of love scene fox scene store scene saying his plans allowed lack of displays of <UNK> inner emotions and thoughts introduction of the priest instead of <UNK> engineer let on to much that knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what is thinking or aware of just too many flaws and poor directing decisions
<START> from the acclaim it got i was expecting more from a korean horror if it's going to be viewed in the same caliber as a tale of two sisters as some other reviews have stated this movie isn't in the same caliber except in budget spent on special effects think horror with a tree and sparse dialogue br br if you're going to have a movie with limited dialogue the plot line and characters have to carry the film this film could have been told quite well in a 30 minute short film concept 2 hours with a lot of staring at trees and terror scenes that make you not only not scared but detract in a what the sort of way does not a good horror movie make br br those people who are stating that this film gave them lasting impressions must literally have heart attacks when decent horror films lay it in
<START> when one watches the animated superman shorts of the 1940s the similarity of the plots can become a bit boring the <UNK> is most often a mad scientist in a hidden threatening metropolis with some evil invention death <UNK> mechanical monsters electric <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what have you br br this one is <UNK> different the bad ones drive around in a car shooting and bombing but the center of action is the gold train on which lois lane travels as the only press reporter it seems train movies have their own typical ingredients from the <UNK> great train robbery on and quite some are featured here cars in motion running on the <UNK> taking the steam <UNK> from the tender in the back fighting with the engineer a switch turned to the train on a side track the fall of people or the whole train from a high bridge it's all in the few minutes of this lovely piece br br but it wouldn't be a superman film if he didn't do some incredible <UNK> involving <UNK> and high <UNK> placement to ultimately win the day if you're a fan of train movies don't miss this it's in the public <UNK> and can be <UNK> <UNK> from archive <UNK>
<START> i think this is the worst movie i have seen since mortal <UNK> 2 the action including the effects is like in a cheap <UNK> a <UNK> tv show the acting is terrible and the dialogs are even more stupid than in <UNK> avoid at all cost

<START> this is one of alfred hitchcock's best films and one of his most underrated i believe it certainly <UNK> a <UNK> or 'the for technical artistry and brilliance it is a macabre tense darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time br br robert walker creates one of hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father hating mother <UNK> but aren't most of hitchcock's villains <UNK> boys bruno it is a disturbing stunning performance that <UNK> the whole film his character is obsessive apparently homosexual look at those deliberately <UNK> ties and hear how he is described as strangely charming and dangerous to cross <UNK> granger certainly knows this as he becomes <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> web after the pair meet on a train bruno knowing some inside information on guy's affairs <UNK> the two murders for each other's benefit walker will kill <UNK> <UNK> conniving wife who is his marriage to beautiful anne whilst granger will murder <UNK> father who he so intensely hates everyone's happy right a win win as bruno <UNK> wrong granger forgets about the <UNK> <UNK> but an obsessed walker doesn't he commits his murder and is determined to <UNK> granger until he <UNK> his side of the bargain too becomes a riveting suspenseful game of cat and mouse in <UNK> capable hands br br hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes we have the whore <UNK> <UNK> estranged wife pregnant to another man she <UNK> a <UNK> ice cream <UNK> whilst openly eating up bruno with her eyes barbara <UNK> <UNK> sister is a <UNK> sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you'll hear from a <UNK> girl in the pictures in the 50's senator <UNK> is <UNK> and self absorbed this is one of the most daring films hitchcock ever made and it is typical to a <UNK> film subtly sexual in detail br br this fits into the film noir category with it's focus on murder lies and <UNK> and shadowy cinematography <UNK> nut is one for the ages and granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and i never believed her relationship with granger still the overwhelming <UNK> <UNK> out the slight <UNK> and it can be safely said that this is one of the best american films ever made br br just look at what <UNK> does here the originality the technical skill we see the murder of <UNK> reflected in her <UNK> glasses a game of <UNK> turns into one of the most thrilling intense scenes you'll ever see a innocent <UNK> turns into a place of murder and foul <UNK> a young boy's balloon is popped <UNK> by walker <UNK> obviously liked what he saw in 'the third man ' children's delight at riding the <UNK> turns into screaming fast paced terror <UNK> <UNK> normal everyday events like no other br br the camera work here is among the best ever seen in a hitchcock film and the premise is to die for it's slick <UNK> sophistication and <UNK> charm the cross cutting between walker and <UNK> characters is magnificent <UNK> do or die <UNK> match is just as vital as villain <UNK> rescue of an <UNK> piece of evidence lost down a drain <UNK> again build his villain into a nasty repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming did anyone else find him strangely attractive more so than granger piece of work we are just as tense as walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain we need him to anyway he holds the key to the story br br you'll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film br br amazing br br 10 10
<START> tourist trap is a genuinely spooky low budget horror film that will surely satisfy horror fans it contains extremely strange atmosphere and there are some quite unnerving moments of total dread and fear some scenes are downright bizarre for example there is one scene when chuck <UNK> sits down to have dinner with a <UNK> that comes to life and starts <UNK> with him before its head falls off there is very little gore but the violence is quite strong for pg rated horror film the <UNK> look very sinister and the climax is horrifying david <UNK> returned to make several other genre films including puppet master and <UNK> still tourist trap is definitely his best horror film so if you want to be scared give this little gem a look 9 out of 10
<START> i've never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest i have ever come i gave it a 9 there are very few movies that i truly love this however is one of them with it's gritty realism fantastic on site and it's great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when i first saw it in 1979 at that point i didn't know about <UNK> violence racial tensions or the struggle to survive live free i doubt that anyone who is an adult or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be <UNK> by this film in the same way i was all those years ago but i will say this if you haven't seen this movie i envy you this is because you have the chance to see this great film for the time for each of us they're different but here's to the <UNK> movies of them all the ones we actually love
<START> i am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film the acting was fine there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling it is <UNK> true that intelligent people are having less and less children or choose to have none at all whereas dumb ass w in <UNK> supporters are <UNK> like <UNK> and though i don't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years i can see mike <UNK> <UNK> prophet coming to be as life imitating art the world is being run by idiots and it will get worse as the intelligent free thinking people become the minority and the <UNK> <UNK> done fans <UNK> them the proof is our farce of an election br br but i <UNK> if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city go see it i have paid my 7 50 plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this date movie or <UNK> dynamite anyone there are laughs there are <UNK> but overall this is entertaining if you have half a brain you will think to yourself how this movie though funny is spot on accurate and a tiny bit uncanny i'm not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown as fox was the one <UNK> this and they wouldn't want any of their sheep to see this and think maybe i will read a book and not watch or or my <UNK> if our society doesn't stop the <UNK> down of everything and the of the english language <UNK> mr bush then this really is where we are going
<START> seen this one in a sneak preview yesterday and must say it was terrible after the credits i thought hey with this cast it'll probably be pretty good didn't at all turn out that way br br lame predictable <UNK> terribly simply drawn characters maybe except a little ms <UNK> and an ending one could <UNK> 10 minutes into the movie and worst of all it <UNK> a delicate theme handicapped persons for low level and mostly tasteless jokes without ever touching anything but the surface of the issue the handicapped person the film <UNK> with the most is the one who is just <UNK> it what kind of message is that and the film doesn't have a thought through ending at all it basically comes down to i love you doesn't matter that you acted like a <UNK> br br to sum it up great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible flick
<START> i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i can't quite yet see mark <UNK> as a leader he's gotten good enough to be a credible manager and that's ok br br the superhero of the movie is the mini cooper it's shown to have the speed <UNK> and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like <UNK> <UNK> character
<START> first of three aztec <UNK> film is the only one that to the best of my knowledge was never completely dubbed into english the film was chopped up and used in pieces by people like jerry warren in other films he combined it with another mexican horror comedy with <UNK> <UNK> to make face of the screaming werewolf and it showed up in attack of the <UNK> mummy and elsewhere the longest of the three films a good <UNK> of this film makes up the two later films which use this as a basis of flash backs the plot of this film has a scientist <UNK> a past life <UNK> experiment which causes his subject to travel back and discover hidden <UNK> in an aztec <UNK> the group as well as a sinister figure known as the bat hope to use the information to discover hidden treasure instead they discover a living mummy who has other plans long and long <UNK> this film has way too little action to sustain its 80 minute running time worse the mummy doesn't even show up until an hour has passed probably the least of the three films its easy to see why this film was cut apart it's the only way to fashion a non sleep inducing film watching the film late last night i found myself fighting to stay awake it was a tough <UNK> and i found that i ended up <UNK> to the point where the mummy showed up given the choice i'd take a pass and watch the second two films
<START> this movie is so <UNK> bad nothing about it makes it worth seeing no effects no suspense and poor dialogue poorly delivered oh and neither a camp or any fear does it contain do yourself a favor and go see the original friday the 13th or preferably <UNK> camp but what ever you do do not see this movie br br even <UNK> appearance at the very beginning can't save it usually in these kinds of films you expect violence suspense and a little gore and some t a the violence was poorly executed the suspense was laughable there was no gore and the t a is <UNK> in the first 5 minutes then nothing at least one of these things properly done would have at least made it watchable br br to say at least one nice thing about it buck flower is great he seems to be the only one who understands they are making schlock and rightly <UNK> it up if everyone else had fit that tone it would have been campy fun no pun intended
<START> what a great film i never knew much about buddy holly but was familiar with his lively and fun music this is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's although i never cared for gary he was fabulous as buddy holly i don't know how accurate the movie is but assume at least for the most part it is accurate which makes the movie all the more interesting the music throughout the movie just adds the <UNK> to this biography i don't think i would change a thing in this film it was all good what a difference in the stars from the 50's to todays music stars how can you compare someone like buddy holly to justin timberlake or any of the other popular singers of this generation
<START> this is a classic street punk rock movie if you remember those times out on the city streets 14 years old two in the morning and nothing better to do than <UNK> from friends house to friends house and <UNK> it this movie brings back old
<START> pretty lame and awful slasher about someone killing the members of a high school track team after their star runner dies during a meet br br christopher george gives a hilariously over the top performance as the track <UNK> coach i don't think anyone has ever taken track and field as seriously as chris does here not even in the <UNK> it's a typically divine cg performance and if you are a fan of the man the legend you should run right out and grab a copy br br but we watch slashers for the murders you know it's true not the performances and <UNK> day fails to deliver on most counts there is one really good kill true horror only comes during a performance by the band never heard of 'em watch <UNK> day and find out why
<START> i cant believe how many excellent actors can be on one show it's the realism and fine acting that makes it look real this has got to be the best comedy ever created to this day and i love seinfeld and everyone loves it is just fabulous and it seems everyone in my family agrees thats no isolated opinion of mine the whole world seems to talk about different incidents and they try to <UNK> them my hat off to the crew some shows have an actor that makes the whole show this plot comedy has a slew 8 of them that's what makes it so amazing some people pray for health wealth or fame i pray that the show never ends john net
<START> a man is a hotel with a partner he finds out the hotel is over <UNK> things just get worse this film has a huge of scenes they must have been put together in sleep it jumps around from place to place it does not stay focused on anything for very long the ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire it then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time the dvd sound track is horrible it takes a fair plot and turns into the worst film i have scene in a long time
<START> my tolerance for <UNK> direction was overwhelmed by some of the choices in this could be really good time <UNK> br br when the romantic <UNK> were of a nature to take me out of the story and into how and why did the movie maker do that mode you got to figure something is missing in there restraint and i think br br brian brown is a capable <UNK> actor usually i think he didn't like the project or the people and it shows i don't remember anything the other guy did can't even picture his face br br on the other hand it doesn't have to be any good to be entertaining some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even ingenious br br i watched this movie 2 00 purchase at the <UNK> rental place against the advice of the screenwriter i understand he was tempted to remove his name from the credits matter of pride i bet
<START> do you know what <UNK> <UNK> on fields that's right <UNK> so when the bbc decided to make a much hyped conspiracy thriller about and <UNK> what we got was some of the <UNK> the bbc has inflicted upon its audience br br spoilers br br fields of gold opens with a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a female scientist according to the right on trendy bbc all scientists are women <UNK> a new strain of <UNK> that will save the third world from <UNK> then the story switches to another equally bland scene if you're going to make a thriller of any type shouldn't you open with a hook that grabs the audience doctor who was brilliant at this as was the x files while 28 days later opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory i guess someone at the bbc didn't think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had trailers stuffed down their throat for weeks in advance br br as the not very exciting story continues a couple of <UNK> one's a drunken man with morals lower than bill <UNK> and bush combined while the other is a female journalist full of virtue investigating patients at a county hospital who might be getting <UNK> off via mercy killings it's at this point things start getting confused as the female journalist is threatened by <UNK> <UNK> and the first episode ends with the main <UNK> <UNK> getting murdered br br the second episode reveals that the patients at the county hospital have actually been dying due to being infected with a this is when things go totally <UNK> wire all throughout fields of gold the audience have been led to believe the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence have been behind the deaths but they're not it turns out the bad guy is an <UNK> farmer who has been <UNK> the in his bedroom and the story ends via the matrix camera work with the drunken male journalist setting fire to a field ridden with thereby <UNK> the throughout the land br br i find it impossible to say a good word about fields of gold at the time of its broadcast i was both a member of the scottish green party and i have since <UNK> my time in the <UNK> movement but even now i am somewhat offended by how <UNK> are portrayed here and to have the bad guy <UNK> a fatal <UNK> <UNK> virus as a warning to the dangers of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is very silly it's a bit like a <UNK> member letting off a <UNK> in london to warn of the dangers of nuclear war i was also slightly offended as to how the male characters were written as being <UNK> while all the females were highly intelligent and morally superior to men there's also other problems with the script especially with regard to if unlike the <UNK> you take the time and trouble to research you'll find it's entirely different from what is seen here oh and if you set fire to <UNK> it doesn't explode like <UNK> perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles <UNK> <UNK> structure wise <UNK> the last ten minutes <UNK> most of what has gone before where as <UNK> <UNK> only lasted about 90 minutes fields of gold lasted twice that length so is <UNK> irritating and illogical br br as a <UNK> <UNK> never makes a good theme for a thriller anyone remember those steven segal movies and it's about time tv and film producers realized this
<START> i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie i think the director filmed it in his back yard there was no real plot br br terrible script br br terrible acting br br the worst production i have ever witnessed a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard br br i don't normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one br br life is to short to waste your time with this movie
<START> i found the movie very real just as much as saving private ryan and gave an <UNK> account from the german perspective the graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much to keep me interested through the whole movie <UNK> was very brutal battle and the scenes gave this movie that stark reality of this battle i recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history this was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by it's realism again the weapons uniforms and hearing it german while reading the subtitles gave it much credit for a good military movie in fact this being a german perspective of the battle i was rooting for the germans even though they were the and ultimate loser of the war
<START> anna christie 1930 br br anna christie has some terrific parts and some amazing performances and yet it should be even better than it is it has drama some of the scenes are really atmospheric and if the interior shots around the table are a bore other shots at night and at sea are really pretty exciting then there are the nearly historical lively scenes set in <UNK> island even a brief <UNK> roller coaster ride and the episode where two women are behind a <UNK> in separate <UNK> and <UNK> to the <UNK> can throw balls to try to tip them over and the women scantily dressed egg the men on is <UNK> sexual come on kind of way all the while garbo at the front of the crowd watches br br garbo of course is what makes this movie more than just another very good early <UNK> she plays all sides of her character she is <UNK> and skeptical and in some kind of inner anguish she laughs and cries <UNK> and pushes <UNK> in some ways it's a forward looking remarkable movie directed by clarence brown who has a whole series of significant films from this pre code sound era br br though based on a successful eugene <UNK> play it's the writing that struggles a little as the actors seem to go through the <UNK> at times marie <UNK> is great in that exaggerated way she almost <UNK> and then there is greta garbo who really does have a natural presence even if it seems she's overacting just slightly at times but then so is everyone else garbo is of course famous first as a silent actress and this is her talking film debut audiences loved her enough that she made a german language version the following year
<START> society <UNK> susan <UNK> hopkins and her wealthy father simon <UNK> henry <UNK> are <UNK> that their young <UNK> joan betty and katie are living a <UNK> lifestyle in <UNK> village with their artist uncle john <UNK> after the death of their parents <UNK> sister and john's brother simon has given up trying to convince john to allow he and susan to take care of the children and have <UNK> to using private detectives to catch him in either <UNK> behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to <UNK> village herself posing as an actress to try to gain information and or <UNK> him to see reason what she discovers however is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle john and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well but that she is quickly falling in love with john inevitably her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom br br i really enjoyed this film and found that its very short running time 70 minutes was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story <UNK> hopkins one of the great 1930's 1940's actresses is delightful in this film her energy style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character even though you know that she's pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends this is the earliest film i've seen ray <UNK> in and he was actually young and non <UNK> looking and apparently three years younger than his co star his energy and <UNK> manner in wise girl were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual darker films honestly though i am usually not remotely a fan of child actors i really enjoyed the two young girls who played <UNK> <UNK> they were <UNK> <UNK> and were really the <UNK> of the film unfortunately i can't dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one which is a shame since both <UNK> a large amount of natural talent br br wise girl was a film that was made three years after the hollywood code was and to some extent this was <UNK> clear by the quick happy ending and the pie in the sky and ease with which the characters lived the alleged <UNK> co <UNK> was in fact a gorgeous <UNK> de <UNK> where the artists lived for free or for trade and everything is tied up very nicely throughout fortunately this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make <UNK> for its <UNK> and short <UNK> and i was able to just take wise girl for what it was a good old fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing unfortunately films of the romantic comedy drama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining or i wouldn't find myself continuously returning to the classics 7 10
<START> i actually saw this movie at a cinema at the time i was working shifts and went there during a <UNK> on a hot summer day when i couldn't sleep the cinema was air <UNK> br br it was an early multi screen complex and i somehow got into the wrong <UNK> i had intended to <UNK> through something else but as things <UNK> there would be no sleeping shortly after the wrong movie began i was additionally <UNK> by a group of female <UNK> who came in and used it as their social club i was the only other person there and it is a measure of the movie's appeal that they <UNK> expected the place to be empty and asked me if i minded their presence i didn't br br within about half an hour the conversation proved to be more interesting than the entertainment i had paid for br br this movie <UNK> out of the screen with the cheesiness of very stale the kind that has little dark hairy growing on the surface i particularly remember my senses being <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> of music that would <UNK> out with very little warning and even less meaning the <UNK> provided an <UNK> cue by putting their fingers in their ears br br it was about some city bird going to live in the sticks amongst a load a <UNK> folk putting them straight but at the same time being taught a moral lesson or two herself like you do a sort of of there was a <UNK> <UNK> about the whole production in particular the leading actress had an irritating habit of staring at every <UNK> with a kind of intense <UNK> compassion as if she herself were the <UNK> saint of <UNK> br br and i believe at some stage she wrote a book br br long before the end i had become fascinated by one of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of sexual <UNK> br br one suspects that there are some to whom sitting quietly for a couple of hours and not having to think <UNK> a <UNK> the best that i can say is that i would not want to share their <UNK> br br i have never seen this movie advertised as showing on television which surprises me it is just the sort of <UNK> that is screened in the afternoon to <UNK> the unemployed for not having jobs br br if you ever work shifts be sure to get into the right theatre or hope for some cleaning ladies
<START> inexplicably i watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about this movie held my attention from beginning to end and ran me through the whole range of emotions and might have helped me discover a few i never knew about br br dustin hoffman absolutely shines as ted kramer he is absolutely convincing as a man having to <UNK> at least three different challenges in life <UNK> husband <UNK> ad executive and loving father meryl streep as joanna kramer was less central to the movie simply because joanna was absent for a good part of it but when she was on screen she gave hoffman a run for his money the true standout though in my opinion had to be young justin henry as billy kramer children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown and justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the <UNK> emotions around his mother and his <UNK> to life with dad only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his dad when it was his mom who walked out on him young justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role br br all in all this is an excellent oscar worthy movie whose only weak point was what i thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle ted and joanna had gone through but there's not much else to complain about here br br 9 10
<START> the synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives i like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of <UNK> with a less fairy tale and more bite what i got was a cast of despicable characters br br for a character driven movie to be effective i need to feel a connection or compassion for the people there was no one with whom i could relate in the movie <UNK> <UNK> whose work i admired in rain man portrays a mentally ill probably <UNK> female that is often rude aggressive and violent her husband <UNK> and yells when he is not hitting or <UNK> someone the children are rude <UNK> they yell at each other and the females in the movie they attack other children with no <UNK> violence <UNK> violence this seems to be an island of <UNK> aggressive violent and rude people all the way around br br the direction is not compelling there are <UNK> scenes that attempt to be art but instead bore the viewer the location is exceptionally gorgeous but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film br br i would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie
<START> this is the best direct to dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border <UNK> agent who is out to stop heroin <UNK> trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van <UNK> best <UNK> scott <UNK> shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out <UNK> 2 <UNK> is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in <UNK> him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isn't quite as athletic as <UNK> is he can still kick with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van <UNK> character's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the <UNK> lies in making this kind of movie and it ain't character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme border
<START> in this episode a man and his dog go after eating dinner with his wife of 50 years he's devoted to his wife and his dog br br while hunting his dog jumps in the river after the dog and he follows the man dies and doesn't know it he tries to talk to his wife and his grave <UNK> to no <UNK> br br what follows is a <UNK> of war between heaven and hell for the man's soul and his dog helps make the decision he's being tricked by the devil and won't go in to heaven unless his dog comes with him br br it makes you wonder if all the animal lovers have the right idea and want to go to heaven with them
<START> it may be a remake of the <UNK> film by <UNK> but it is wrong to consider it only in that way it was supposed to expose <UNK> novel in a completely different way as a musical is excellent the scenery is terrific the characters good and anyone like leonard <UNK> who considers the <UNK> music awful must be completely deaf i strongly recommend it
<START> this movie is sad according to my fellow imdb users spoiler <UNK> uses stock footage from the <UNK> films well since i have not seen the <UNK> movies i cannot say but i do notice some pretty bad editing and even worse acting this movie is one big steaming pile of s it makes absolutely no sense here is this thing that calls itself a plot mad scientist re creates <UNK> <UNK> kill people sheriff <UNK> spoiler although i don't know what it is that i'm spoiling sheriff catches on to mad doctor's plans army guys are sent in and <UNK> start killing army guys <UNK> yeah right i could make a clay figure that looks more real the fx are the <UNK> ever used in a movie there is a lot of gore cheap gore it doesn't even look real i will agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing this movie has going for it is the fact that it ends there are about two seconds of originality in this film and that only comes from when the sheriff is talking to some tax agent on the phone about his electric bill or something this idea has been used in about 100 000 other movies with 100 000 different names overall i'm gonna give <UNK> 1 5 just because it ended
<START> first off i have to say acting isn't very good miranda <UNK> is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly spencer her brother is a way much better actor spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act <UNK> on the other hand tries to act her heart out but sorry it just isn't good sam doesn't even get credit i mean come on pretty self centered eh freddy isn't bad i don't have a comment i must add that <UNK> and her puppet sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast they go shouting out all their lines it's sorta bad influence in a way because <UNK> has a web show and if kids will copy this they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe br br the only nice things is that it has some funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining at least this show isn't boring it has nice plots pretty strong many kids will like this because they don't look for flaws br br overall this is a bad show but it's not boring
<START> i know this film has had a fairly rough ride from the critics but i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed it the real star here is the fantastic dylan <UNK> he never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied <UNK> he also manages to <UNK> a sweet charm that <UNK> his outrageous <UNK> special mention must also go to michael who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city <UNK> accent the only weak link is caine who while obviously having a great laugh <UNK> it up plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character it probably won't play that well overseas but it's well worth a watch all the same
<START> horrendous comedy in which a beautiful crazy woman <UNK> tyler <UNK> destroys the lives of three men matt dillon paul reiser and john goodman dillon hires a hit man michael douglas to kill her what is happening to comedy the year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies ever saving silverman sugar and spice freddy got <UNK> etc etc this is one of the worst there's not one repeat not one funny moment in it the jokes are either stupid unfunny <UNK> or real sick also there's a strong hatred of women in this garbage the only main female character tyler is constantly used as a sex object also extreme bloody violence is thrown in at the end the only bearable moments come from <UNK> <UNK> as a psychiatrist and andrew <UNK> clay in two roles both <UNK> dillon goodman and reiser have hit an all time career low with this the only way to go is up and poor tyler she quit doing intelligent <UNK> independent films for this and douglas what was he on when he agreed to this an utter piece of crap to be avoided at all costs
<START> this movie is simply one of the best movies i have the of <UNK> it took me years to come up with this movie and it was well worth it the movie is meant to be anti drug propaganda but turns itself into the opposite while not even halfway through the movie the <UNK> look on the faces of the players as they receive their bounty of drugs is pleasing to all those who observe <UNK> the final phase <UNK> their drug induced lives heroin comes for its say <UNK> this is the anti drug message that was so <UNK> sought the soundtrack for this movie kicks butt by far it is one of pink best albums ever if ever the chance take a look listen and moment to witness a spectacularly made movie
<START> maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like <UNK> but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a <UNK> i don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice hell i would have done it for free this magical aircraft managed to <UNK> from a to a to a <UNK> in an hour and the power <UNK> worked <UNK> and the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kid's game of where everyone spoke different languages i actually <UNK> the <UNK> and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as i thought at first it was
<START> american war movie fans might be bored out of their <UNK> by this movie but that boredom is born of ignorance <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are always like that sit around and wait get some <UNK> get drunk at the base wheel and deal with the businessman kick a prisoner around cover up the killing of the street <UNK> by the green private then boom there goes two fuel <UNK> and for 10 minutes a small arms battle with one high caliber machine gun then wait for <UNK> to plan a way to knock out their <UNK> and then end up killing a few civilians in the process of doing it if reality doesn't work for western viewers there's always top gun or rambo top gun realistic nope br br the best part of realism was the way all the planes dropped <UNK> like <UNK> they had to do that because carter and reagan gave the <UNK> so many <UNK> also the wave of <UNK> was excellent a better <UNK> attack even than apocalypse now the sight of their <UNK> dropping and shooting was a scene of impending death from above for whoever they were aimed at br br it's funny how the <UNK> were able to make an honest afghanistan movie within a year after their departure but it took the us six years is just as real if you apply it to <UNK> too someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you cause they care more about the land it's a movie <UNK> should watch unfortunately i don't think anyone has ever made english subtitles i might have to make some
<START> my giving this film a score of 8 is relative to other feature length films from 1930 by the standards of films made just a few years later this film might receive a score of only 6 or 7 mostly because the sound quality was so poor now it is possible that the film sounded better and the fox movie channel did show a <UNK> print it did have a lot of lines and <UNK> but i assume the sound problem was always an issue that's because sound in movies was still a novelty in 1930 and many of the hollywood talking pictures of 1930 sounded terrible with background characters often drowning out the leads characters <UNK> together to make sure they are picked up by the <UNK> or inconsistent quality such as what was seen in the bishop murder case <UNK> angels and other films of the day this was all made much worse in the big trail because most of the film was shot outside something <UNK> of at the time quite an <UNK> but also something that really stretched the talents of the sound <UNK> so while the film was very hard to listen to i realize that they had to start somewhere so i can forgive this especially since the <UNK> scenes are breathtaking a major <UNK> for 1930 br br the plot is rather similar to <UNK> a western that came out the following year and which captured the oscar for best picture unfortunately <UNK> isn't all that great a film and i actually like the big trail more due to the scope of the film while some might <UNK> at the big slow moving pace i saw it as a great history lesson about the <UNK> endured by those traveling west on <UNK> trains plus the whole thing just looked so beautiful as director <UNK> walsh went to significant trouble to film on location and the big trail looks almost like a film version of some adams <UNK> br br as for the acting it was pretty good this was a major break for young john wayne as his previous screen appearances were at best minor and <UNK> here he was given the lead and did a dandy job though he was obviously young and a little less john wayne ish than he was in later films as his screen persona was not yet firmly established another interesting part was played by <UNK> power ii <UNK> <UNK> father he looked nothing like his extremely handsome son and looked and sounded almost exactly like <UNK> from the <UNK> cartoons he made very few sound films dying just a year after making this film so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor br br overall the film is well worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few overly long scenes here and there for 1930 it was a remarkable achievement more so than the much more famous and award winning <UNK> made the following year much of the reason the big trail didn't win an oscar most likely was because all quiet on the western front came out the same year and it is truly one of the great films
<START> once upon a time way back in the 1940's there lived an actress named <UNK> lake a beautiful talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big budget hollywood pictures fast forward to the late 1960's age alcoholism and all around bad luck has <UNK> <UNK> favorite actress now a miss lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers joan crawford and bette davis and fall back on good ol' reliable horror but flesh feast really she couldn't have possibly been that washed up to put it <UNK> flesh feast is a lifeless pile garbage possibly one of the top 5 worst films i've ever seen and i've seen them all lake plays a scientist who is plotting with <UNK> to bring hitler back to life with youth <UNK> experiments involving <UNK> that's right <UNK> unless you're a huge fan of heather hughes run away and never look back br br i know very little about this <UNK> lake person as well as 40's flicks but to think that such a successful career actually became that dismal is actually pretty sad flesh feast is almost impossible to get through and by almost i mean absolutely directed by brad director of <UNK> camp pictures and the man who <UNK> brought us the greatest b movie ever made blood freak just a couple years later one has to wonder is this what blood freak would have been like if hadn't co directed with steve <UNK> if so then god bless steve <UNK> you wouldn't think that a religious <UNK> blood <UNK> turkey monster could be that much better than experiments involving <UNK> and hitler but it really really is so forget you ever heard of this one and go find blood freak it's just waiting to entertain you fast forward a couple years later <UNK> lake dies of broke and forgotten the end i hate you flesh feast 1 10
<START> just saw this film at and was <UNK> i've never been a huge fan of scratching but this film had me hooked from the <UNK> it's listed as a documentary but never really felt like one can't remember the last time i had so much fun watching a documentary it has a style and an energy that is refreshing insightful and never too preachy the production values were up there too shot on film with cool cuts and an amazing soundtrack overall a smart entertaining and <UNK> piece
<START> chop shop the second feature from <UNK> is a rare breed it is an american film that tells a story not usually found in american cinema the story of the of a minority living in poverty it is a work of simple beauty shot on location in queens new york in the shadows of <UNK> stadium chop shop is neo realism to the core featuring a cast of non actors it has more in common with <UNK> de <UNK> classic <UNK> thieves than anything made in the united states there is no score or soundtrack all the music and sounds are <UNK> watching it feels like watching a great foreign film it takes us to another world because it is so <UNK> to see however this other world is not post world war ii rome or <UNK> or new <UNK> it is contemporary new york city br br tells the story of <UNK> <UNK> better known as <UNK> he is a 12 year old latin american kid with no parents or family unit to watch after him he lives in a tiny room upstairs in the auto shop that he also works at he shares the same bed with his teenage sister <UNK> neither of them have made it passed second grade <UNK> though young is tough and mature he acts as the head of the small family he <UNK> his sister up with a job and he himself does anything he can to make a buck when not working at the chop shop he sells <UNK> dvds on the streets and candy in <UNK> he <UNK> for <UNK> auto parts and sells them to the many auto <UNK> <UNK> the street where he lives br br <UNK> is <UNK> when he learns his sister is working nights as a prostitute he himself becomes <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> by the law he begins to steal first car parts and later <UNK> like antonio the desperate protagonist in <UNK> thieves we cannot blame <UNK> for becoming a thief it is merely survival <UNK> and save up in hopes of buying a food <UNK> van for 4 500 they see the van as their way out and there is much optimism however as is usually the case in neo realism we know this will only lead to disappointment br br riveting performance is what gives <UNK> to chop <UNK> realism here is a 12 year old character that needs to be <UNK> independent and <UNK> naive whether he is directing cars to the shop selling movies and <UNK> bars or playing with his sister in their <UNK> room it is authentic br br chop shop is a <UNK> reminder that not all american children grow up in a land of opportunity lifestyle is what many in middle class white america consider <UNK> they act <UNK> the poverty and <UNK> in foreign lands while <UNK> their coffee and reading the new york times on sunday morning but make themselves blind to it on their own streets once you watch chop shop you will think differently of the kids candy on the subway br br more reviews at www com
<START> this film is about a party put together by the high school scary girl per the <UNK> of these sorts of films she gets <UNK> to hold the party at a house which used to be a <UNK> a dubious place long shut down and locked up apparently the history of this piece of property is one of those town secrets best left <UNK> of among proper folk though the legend does get <UNK> about among the young br br why was this <UNK> really shut down what actually happened there in the past br br i like these kill kill kill films of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them not copied from a hundred other films the highlights of this film are a petty <UNK> 7 11 robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid view the changing clothes scene by the good girl witnessed by her jerk younger brother the eventual demise of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water being a <UNK> against the supernatural the best part of this film is when the possessed party <UNK> dances to <UNK> in front of the <UNK> that scene rocks
<START> charles <UNK> of <UNK> was his longest film to date though at just over 45 minutes in length it was not quite a feature film with world war one just drawing to a close many popular <UNK> of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops and chaplin was no exception and so the lovable tramp went to war the film begins with the tramp in training and the character is hilariously inept at even the <UNK> military <UNK> including <UNK> and gun <UNK> much to the disgust of his <UNK> sergeant the tramp then finds himself in the <UNK> faced with a more <UNK> <UNK> though the germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he the <UNK> moment when the tramp declares that he single <UNK> captured thirteen german soldiers by surrounding them had me in <UNK> br br there are plenty of other great moments in this film chaplin <UNK> to find his sleeping <UNK> underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface br br however the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve chaplin <UNK> behind enemy lines disguised as a tree the reactions of the bumbling german soldiers <UNK> just <UNK> from a <UNK> enemy as they are single <UNK> disabled one by one are highly amusing especially when one soldier <UNK> an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for <UNK> br br this is a very enjoyable film and one of the best of <UNK> pre <UNK> efforts highly recommended
<START> i see that the majority of the comments so far have been if not overly positive then at least positive i can not understand that the only explanation i can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film because this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen it makes <UNK> creek ii and mutant look like masterpieces of horror the acting is shaky at best and awful for the most part the entire movie is almost pitch black probably so they could shoot it all in the same location the monster looks like something from one of roger <UNK> worst films and the plot well the less said about it the better br br one to avoid at all costs
<START> i thought the movie was great i thought <UNK> <UNK> was great and was glad to see her move on into some more interesting roles i even overlook the fact that the print i have wasn't quite put back together correctly but who cares
<START> cute movie feel good movie i had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent i had high hopes for this movie based purely on <UNK> being in this movie i have never seen him in anything not worth while true to form this movie delivered for me i enjoyed the story the movie is full of great actors and actresses the hilarious <UNK> smith essence <UNK> and of course miller i really liked this movie a lot i didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that i thought the movie should have detailed the issue was apparently resolved but i would have appreciated a discussion <UNK> the issues i liked the movie so much that i am now buying the movie after i've already rented and watched it
<START> maybe here in sydney we are all <UNK> side down and as a result we get to lap up like this s <UNK> in classy theaters released here in 1980 this hilarious all <UNK> drama was <UNK> with <UNK> of delight at the session i attended in fact the audience were so into the ludicrous antics on screen it played like a rocky horror session within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster the <UNK> boat scene where you can see the <UNK> of water tossed in from off set after that it was every <UNK> for himself and the cinema <UNK> with advice cheering for bad acting and <UNK> reactions the <UNK> in the hold among the <UNK> is especially idiotic and allows drunken viewers with friends in altered states also watching to contribute appropriately i call these films with michael caine his holiday house films as i always <UNK> he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and doesn't want to spend his <UNK> like jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called
<START> around 1980 the name <UNK> ho was attached to a series of low comedy action films starring an actor with the unlikely name <UNK> chong although no <UNK> of the genre they remain surprisingly entertaining films for those with a high tolerance for silliness br br it is altogether unclear why ho or <UNK> would want to make a film that would attack jackie chan's drunken master the film that <UNK> the making of comedy action films in hong kong but that's what this is a savage attack on the chan film the imitation chan who stars in this movie learns to cause his opponents to laugh themselves to death a pointless gimmick in any genre br br along with all the flaws one expects from a <UNK> ho film of this period no continuity no motivation incomprehensible plot line irrelevant and unbelievable characters the film suffers from two unforgivable faults that effectively make it unwatchable the fight scenes stink and the comedy isn't funny br br pointless
<START> is an awful movie the script the story the acting are all simply laughable <UNK> plays a man who pays <UNK> <UNK> to seduce his wife yes this is as ridiculous as it sounds both and <UNK> offer incredibly and <UNK> bad acting plays the aggressive <UNK> and angry wife she is good looking but has zero acting talent the film has one hit song called which is composed and sung by <UNK> <UNK> i never could understand the hype around this song as i never found it particularly good though it is catchy the film is supposed to be a thriller but instead it just looks like a comic strip thanks to the terrible direction and writing avoid this <UNK> at any cost
<START> the of this movie is <UNK> one moment it's making fun of latin americans american tourists and banana <UNK> in general the other it wants to be touching with burned <UNK> and <UNK> even the serious revolutionary hero becomes a parody of a revolutionary at one point but the comedy parts aren't even funny because it's so obviously stolen from star wars yes star wars the hero is basically a rogue with a heart of gold add to this stereotypical sounds effects latin americans who speak english with one another and a villain that just disappears from the story and whats the point it's basically revolution propaganda with no resolution and no planning because there is just no way these people can lead a country the us government are bad guys but <UNK> make money producing this not some poor farmer that's for sure
<START> it's true that this is not realistic story but romantic comedy is not a genre that i look to for realism what counts is that the characters are likeable and as needed sexy <UNK> is beautiful and relaxed and jake <UNK> is handsome in an <UNK> kind of way they have enough chemistry to make the story believable in the area that counts sexual attraction i would love to see either of them in another movie and yes the clown is pretty cute too
<START> i haven't had a chance to view the previous film but from what i've read on other <UNK> it was supposedly worse than this one although i doubt that is possible i'm a huge fan of the zombie genre and i am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures that for all <UNK> and purposes are human as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head that said <UNK> 2 takes the zombie movie to an all new low br br without giving any big spoilers which i really should do just so you won't bother wasting your time actually watching this movie i would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries special forces <UNK> pile could have probably survived longer than the <UNK> <UNK> soldiers in this film for crying out loud they should have called them the special education forces instead if you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an <UNK> of zombies at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses i understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the <UNK> crazy person <UNK> back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basement br br the writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more high tech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a <UNK> for and the idea has merit if it wasn't stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of <UNK> film making i mean come on zombie films aren't exactly high art and the viewer expects some tongue in cheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills but <UNK> 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters if you are a zombie movie fan like me please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one
<START> so why on earth would i see <UNK> lives of the <UNK> <UNK> answer johnny vegas and <UNK> crook vegas i have seen live and thoroughly enjoyed i think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to retain extreme crook i know only from probably the greatest comedy of the last 10 years along with <UNK> 'the <UNK> as <UNK> he was simply hilarious and i was interested in how he would <UNK> to another character on the big screen br br ok so me and the boyfriend went down to the <UNK> last night and the film was very funny only because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter <UNK> and dave had was delivered with <UNK> and enthusiasm by the talent of vegas and crook they are destined for better things have done better already <UNK> and i even believe vegas would make a decent straight actor the trite scenes where he says he misses his wife came almost close to touching although the spoiler tacked on scene at the end where he is taken back by his wife needed to be <UNK> it just <UNK> believable and throughout the film vegas only appears to miss his wife 2 or 3 times br br the film became <UNK> unfunny and plain old well grotesque when sex was mentioned not i add when it was shown on screen gratuitous explanation of what was in his <UNK> and why was not even slightly funny and just made me feel a little bit ill also totally was the inclusion of the character of jeremy picking his nose before showing a close up of the <UNK> on his finger just him picking his nose would have raised a smile he was a pathetic character and it would have just made him look as low as possible but showing the <UNK> close up was just not needed and was rank br br one scene i did think was hilarious involving sex was vegas in the <UNK> his conversation with the second bloke just <UNK> the fact that <UNK> <UNK> always endless ecstasy not that i'd know br br that's about all i can say really i will end with this and this is actually my main critique of the film this is supposed to revive the british film industry it is no <UNK> that is for sure it isn't even a <UNK> <UNK> you'd have to have a heart of stone not to throw up at that one and 3 million pounds really could have been put into a better project <UNK> <UNK> england <UNK> was a wonderful little known british comedy and was made for far less than 3 million i only hope that the will learn from <UNK> lives of the <UNK> <UNK> and not get so gratuitous in future although the terrible reviews this film is getting are only <UNK> the box office
<START> i've never watched a file in a language i don't understand just because i wanted to see the movie and i couldn't find it with english <UNK> i don't know how much i missed but it wasn't much probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together i want to mention to the from germany there's no reason to feel that he when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film like i said i don't understand japanese or at least only the very small amount i came away with from reading the very lengthy novel pro my favorite all time book which i could not put down took the next day off from work just to finish reading i don't know if there's an english dubbed or <UNK> version but if the film but if there is i'd love to see it the film was incredible in japanese anything better is <UNK> of the cake <UNK>
<START> this is a weak throw together of just about everything <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> relations <UNK> sexual <UNK> a very big clumsy metaphor about <UNK> being at the cross roads between its past which is <UNK> by everything virgin becoming queen of the household and its future which is <UNK> by listening to music in <UNK> and being a lesbian and never having kids br br it plays on a rather recent <UNK> legend involving a virgin and a forest king assuming the shape of a goat imagery is also based on that legend but unfortunately the treatment is very incoherent <UNK> seems to think the end <UNK> the means she can use all kinds of dream like sequences and then pick and choose which ones true and which ones are imaginary how can the ride in the <UNK> with the forest king be real for all three girls but the scene outside the <UNK> be real only in imaginary the ending just drags on and on i can't believe the movie's runtime is only 98 minutes have i been watching a director's cut without knowing it with the three girls having to look at the camera for about 10 seconds while looking afraid and happy at the same time so obvious br br i never thought i could spot bad acting in a movie whose language i don't understand but it didn't take long to see that is over acting most of the time as if she was playing in a silent movie br br it wasn't so bad as i kept thinking the director was just starting and wanted to capture what she thought her generation was all about on film by doing a half experimental movie until i realized that the director was actually <UNK> years old when making the movie and that her work is probably serious
<START> this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses his low budget hong kong movies were all fast paced <UNK> thrillers that highlight his amazing <UNK> skills and talent for light comedy his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being <UNK> for stallone or chuck norris there is nothing about chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star in his hong kong films chan is never dull with the movies being one rapid fire martial arts sequence after another but the <UNK> is lifeless throughout danny aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together both have been better in worse movies the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so <UNK> and drab it wouldn't be until the made in canada <UNK> in the <UNK> that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie
<START> this film launched my theory about films based on books instead of following the cliche you've read the book now see the film if you are looking for a good book to read try one upon which a movie you like was based because it'll be 10 times better br br i saw this film on its initial release at the national theater in downtown eugene and liked it so much that i stayed to see it again it's a perfect of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors jon voight with what became my favorite book the water is wide by pat <UNK> br br i can think of no better movie about the <UNK> of teaching and the ironic challenges of life two tiny <UNK> br br 1 the video suffers severely from pan and <UNK> and deserves a <UNK> version 2 the title should be restored to the name of the book a reference to one of the most touching enigmatic songs ever written
<START> the story of farewell to the king is intriguing an american <UNK> i had the impression he and his 3 <UNK> were only trying to escape capture in the <UNK> as their desperate escape by raft to <UNK> is not your classic <UNK> but no sooner do they come <UNK> when they are discovered by the japanese <UNK> character a sergeant has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed and incredibly no one noticed his <UNK> in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him but anyway nolte is taken in by a tribe of and becomes their king after <UNK> another so he's out of the war then the british <UNK> show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the japanese br br unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ruins an interesting story instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war now with a tribe of warriors under his command nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe he speaks as if english is almost a foreign language rarely using <UNK> he makes sweeping gestures when he talks and acts like he is one with nature as if he was raised in the jungle br br there is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the british <UNK> with nolte and the tribe but <UNK> character is never believable it always looks like he's overacting he needed to be a little more of an american soldier and a lot less of a as it is he comes across not as a regal king but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is but that is not the intent of the film as the script has him being admired and trusted by the british <UNK> there is never any suggestion that the british thought his behavior was strange he is simply viewed by the british as the leader of the tribe thus it always seems that <UNK> character isn't fitting in with what's supposed to be happening in the film br br another actor might have done a great job with the role delivered his lines <UNK> and made it an outstanding movie but nolte ruins the film by <UNK> up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be br br what a waste
<START> i enjoy films of various kinds and qualities whether it's your typical standard hollywood action movie or your oscar season tear <UNK> movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be enjoyable for me br br in soap girl i received nothing but confusion first we meet <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> worker who seems to attract all the customers in the <UNK> a virgin poet named harry comes in one day and they fall in love after that there are various twists and turns thrown into the plot which seem to lead nowhere br br although many have commented on the controversial issue of an asian prostitute being exploited by the white man keep in mind that this film was made by an asian director who wanted to bring light to the issue but whether he succeeds or not does not matter for the issue at hand is whether the movie is enjoyable or not br br for me soap girl fails to meet the standard i expect from movies it was hard for me to get involved emotionally with this movie given the loose plot and the mediocre acting worse it seems as if the director wanted to make a drama when the tone falls more towards comedy br br a movie such as soap girl which fails to trap me into the magic of cinema will always leave me bored throughout the movie i couldn't help but think what is this really about a movie has to answer that question before it is made if not what you'll end up with is an empty push to <UNK> the audience br br grade d br br
<START> i was referred to this movie by a friend i had never heard of it but i thought it had christopher so i rented it and come to find out that wasn't christopher it was thomas jane who was great it this film i love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house the characters were great everyone of them and the script was amazing i really wish skip woods would write and direct another movie in my book <UNK> is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and kid thing after a shady past but then his old drug dealer buddy shows up and it becomes quite the <UNK> this is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential in thomas jane but this movie is very rare but i have found it in a couple of hollywood <UNK> on vhs so dust off the old vcr and pop in <UNK> because it gets pee <UNK> seal of <UNK>
<START> this extremely low budget monster flick centers around a group of mine exploring an abandoned gold mine in order to see if its worth <UNK> they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time the word that most came to mind as i watched this movie was the script and acting is terrible the stop motion monster effects were unintentionally funny and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly looked like a <UNK> nightmare all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie failed not from lack of effort but maybe from either a lack of budget experience and or lack of creative inspiration the whole thing came off like it was either a college project or a first film made by amateurs i have a certain amount of affection for films like that even when they completely miss the mark i guess what i'm saying is i give it an b for effort and a d for actual results not <UNK> bad as some low budget monster movies i've seen but still not worth seeing unless you have a lot of free time on your hands i'm voting it a 4
<START> <UNK> queen of the desert is always being <UNK> out as a masterpiece of australian cinema i found it quite disappointing the lead actors are great <UNK> <UNK> is aging beautifully guy <UNK> should do more comedy instead of the <UNK> roles he chooses and i've been a fan of hugo <UNK> since i saw him play <UNK> <UNK> ago the cinematography is great but if you've ever been to the australian <UNK> you'd know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have shot it on the movie equivalent of a box <UNK> and it still would have looked spectacular br br so what's my problem well three things first there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole film a woman who has to earn her living shooting <UNK> <UNK> balls out of her <UNK> in a <UNK> pub deserves our sympathy wife doesn't get much better treatment br br second the scene when they sing i will survive to a group of <UNK> is offensive to try to draw any sort of parallel between the struggles of drag queens and <UNK> and the almost total destruction of <UNK> culture which is what i assume the scene is supposed to do shows a level of historical understanding worthy of paris hilton br br last of all and the greatest <UNK> of the film is that it just isn't funny enough did <UNK> elliott actually talk to any drag queens when writing the film anyone who knows a drag queen or three or four knows that most of them have <UNK> like wits and they're not afraid to use them now i can understand that a lot of drag queen banter probably would have got the film refused <UNK> but elliott should have been able to gather enough fit for the <UNK> material to complete his film br br so all in all a waste of a good idea and a great cast
<START> highly suggest not to watch this film <UNK> if not mentally mature enough the film create quite realistic <UNK> with the steps how they prevent from terrorism if such touch wood incident happened london suppose a lovely and chill city while these kind of wars still going on just wasting the time and money for study and living every time passing around p square the feeling really obvious uncomfortable actually i don't want to vote the scored means nothing just 4 <UNK> in the <UNK> br br only and positive thinking cities encourage better economy and <UNK> to keep <UNK> time <UNK> and money
<START> for a norris movie this is pretty tame for an action movie it is kind of dull and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed it was nice that the killer's every moves were not <UNK> by the <UNK> of 80's action movies but come on the only non predictable move defies the plot and the set up of the editing mainly it is said rather early on that the killer jack <UNK> whom is one of the few slightly known actors only kills women yet he all of a sudden stops his m o and kills men huh i guess it can be <UNK> and <UNK> some way but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women br br yet again i'm sure that there is a reason i e to build suspense but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior br br fans of <UNK> may enjoy the small cameo by <UNK> <UNK> as victor but his brief <UNK> cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous br br
<START> three ten year old children born at the same time during a <UNK> <UNK> begin to <UNK> murder anybody that <UNK> them br br while killer kid movies weren't exactly new at the time of this twisted 80's slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film bloody birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities it a fine line between cheesy and creepy but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot there's some strong murder scenes as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure br br the cast does a fairly good job young stars elizabeth <UNK> and k c <UNK> deliver some menacing performances while rising star julie brown does a <UNK> before a memorable murder scene veteran star susan <UNK> does well as the teacher and jose <UNK> has a cameo appearance br br all around this off beat slasher entry isn't bad though it's admittedly not flawless but it is well worth watching for genre fans br br out of
<START> let me begin with a personal note as a film and television buff more on the enjoyment side of life i love what james woods can do and has done and i always love <UNK> griffith and natasha wagner was very good in this awful miserable <UNK> true crime <UNK> br br whoever really wrote this film apparently never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents yes some thieves are <UNK> but they have very short careers as thieves truly successful thieves are seldom caught because they don't do junk or any drugs before going on a score job br br the james woods character was true to this <UNK> in the beginning of this film and then the script fell apart completely he turns into a raging alcoholic lunatic nice work for a high strung guy like woods maybe but not in the least bit believable br br most criminals are lazy if they wanted to work they would work br br these people in this film are beautiful self indulgent drug <UNK> <UNK> losers they couldn't pull off a real score in the real world the real world where a big and <UNK> security guard who beats the living hell out of a skinny kid as happens in the early scenes of this dog keeps him beat down and doesn't let him up ever br br how many ways did i find to hate this film many even totally vulgar people like most sneak thieves and <UNK> have a larger <UNK> than these <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> scenes with the neo nazi <UNK> all <UNK> ain't neo nazis and those who are neo nazi speed dealers just ain't that dumb br br this film earned a two because natasha wagner was extremely good in her role as rose and because <UNK> griffith still has <UNK> something special ' or at least she had it for this brutal and <UNK> stupid film i'm not one to sing <UNK> of real criminals for any reason but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that they'd all be dead or in jail by act 2 scene 1 watching a lousy zombie movie would be time better spent than this thing and i hate zombies
<START> one of the best movies i've ever seen has to be the wind and the lion <UNK> the scenes br br <UNK> <UNK> over the wall a <UNK> british gentleman <UNK> gets up from tea with <UNK> <UNK> and drops three of them with a <UNK> revolver in his coat a <UNK> from the ghost of empire <UNK> we forget <UNK> we forget br br u s marines coming <UNK> from the long long gone brooklyn they were carrying it should have been <UNK> but oh wow and the winchester <UNK> blowing large holes in <UNK> natives and even more <UNK> and <UNK> europeans br br sean connery o wow wondering <UNK> kind of gun does <UNK> use br br teddy <UNK> brian keith o wow wondering what kind of gun does use ' and writing yet another angry letter to winchester about the stock on his winchester 95 br br armed with but a sword a <UNK> <UNK> officer his pistol and drawing his sword honor that's something long dead from a world long gone but would never have <UNK> a plane full of children into a building br br at magnificent best and now out on dvd
<START> i wish the series had not ended so soon although the acting may not be the greatest in the world it does end on a positive note and does teach morals and values to the viewers <UNK> <UNK> did a good job of portraying a high school student who had lost her parents etc <UNK> was great as in the previous 3 if you are not into the happy ending this movie like the previous 3 in the series is not for you this day in which we live you can not see enough about the bad guys getting what they deserve and the good guys coming out on top the bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil that is exactly what happens in this one it is a great family movie please see it if you have not already
<START> the visual <UNK> of this film is <UNK> by anything i've seen and the work required to make achieve it must have been incredibly long and tedious you don't just stick <UNK> grainy film in your camera to get this look don't watch this film to be entertained watch it to be visually <UNK> watch it to be challenged and <UNK> in your thoughts on film and any other topic that comes to mind religion will likely be one thought br br
<START> this movie is so awesome i loved it it was really scary i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there it probably helped that i watched it at midnight if you want a real scare rent this one 10 10
<START> should you wish to see the worst film ever made look no further some wretched movies are watchable because they are unintentionally funny alas american movie has no wit at all no unintentional humor just <UNK> thought by its director to be laughable br br for those who liked this film i suggest you watch kevin smith's <UNK> similar in tone in <UNK> you will find creativity wit and enjoyment all on a <UNK> budget it should make you forget this hideous effort
<START> this movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals one of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available br br the good 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about <UNK> chan br br the bad the main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman <UNK> chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format no <UNK> between the 3 story lines minimum dialogue in the film <UNK> by and chat programs on pc no cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema
<START> john <UNK> one man show is both funnier and more involving than most movies you'll see a number of devices such as slide <UNK> are used to enhance the story but this is essentially good old fashioned performance art in particular check out his hilarious rendition of i will survive highly recommended
<START> scary movie 1 4 epic movie date movie meet the <UNK> not another teen movie and another gay movie making superhero movie the <UNK> in a series that single <UNK> ruined the parody genre now i'll admit it i have a soft spot for classics such as airplane and the naked gun but you know you've <UNK> a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile off in fact the only thing that might really <UNK> you into going to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sell out leslie <UNK> br br you can tell he needs the money <UNK> that or he <UNK> to go down with the ship like a good <UNK> would in no way is he bringing down this genre but hell he's not helping it but if i feel sorry for anybody in this film its decent actor drake bell who is put through an immense amount of embarrassment the people who are put through the largest amount of torture by far however is the audience forced to sit through 90 minutes of <UNK> <UNK> no funnier than <UNK> br br after <UNK> disaster films in airplane police shows in the naked gun and hollywood horrors in scary movie 3 and 4 producer david <UNK> sets his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this <UNK> comedy <UNK> everything from spider man to x men and superman returns br br shortly after being bitten by a <UNK> altered <UNK> high school <UNK> rick <UNK> drake bell begins to experience a startling transformation now <UNK> skin is as strong as steel and he possesses the strength of ten men determined to use his <UNK> powers to fight crime rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of the <UNK> a <UNK> crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law <UNK> citizens br br but every superhero needs a nemesis and after lou <UNK> christopher <UNK> is caught in the middle of an experiment gone horribly awry he develops the power to <UNK> the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes the villainous <UNK> intent on achieving <UNK> the <UNK> attempts to gather as much life force as possible as the noble <UNK> sets out to take down his <UNK> and realize his destiny as a true hero craig writes and directs this low flying spoof br br featuring tracy morgan pamela anderson leslie <UNK> marion ross jeffrey <UNK> and <UNK> hall br br hell superhero movie may earn some merit in the fact that it's a hell of a lot better than meet the <UNK> and epic movie but with great responsibility comes one of the worst <UNK> of 2008 to date <UNK> but a little less irritating than meet the <UNK> and in the same sense much more forgettable than meet the <UNK> but maybe that's a good reason there are still some of us trying to <UNK> away the <UNK> that was meet the <UNK> from our memory br br my final verdict avoid unless you're one of <UNK> people who enjoy such car crash cinema as bad as date movie and scary movie 2 but not quite as bad as meet the <UNK> or epic movie super villain
<START> van <UNK> copies hitchcock's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern <UNK> a <UNK> and nudity from anne <UNK> unless you have a strong desire to see ms <UNK> naked there is absolutely no reason to see this film instead of the original hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and van <UNK> fails to realize that in hiding the nudity and the gore the original shower scene is all the more terrifying ask janet leigh about that one the acting is also much <UNK> and the technical aspects much less impressive
<START> great historical movie will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch view is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white wished it had been in color wow
<START> as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to <UNK> it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many <UNK> towards the film i sat down in my chair one <UNK> evening and started to watch the beginning <UNK> from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me why to <UNK> a sentence from the <UNK> by mark in the movie about <UNK> rome but the <UNK> <UNK> scene with a young half naked couple <UNK> and <UNK> running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded <UNK> whilst the credits also <UNK> me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that <UNK> would go that far in <UNK> all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly one br br <UNK> does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob the director and the <UNK> of <UNK> pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be <UNK> by taste by message by some feeling of epic <UNK> whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste <UNK> shows the most <UNK> side of human being in the most wicked <UNK> manner some scenes are so disgusting that i don't think there are any people whose <UNK> will not be affected by them some say that the rome under <UNK> reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption <UNK> at that time various sexual <UNK> were <UNK> to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these <UNK> so strictly and make it <UNK> an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre <UNK> of the producers and their strange <UNK> br br huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore <UNK> is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of <UNK> <UNK> a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom <UNK> forces his most <UNK> ways of <UNK> and rapes moreover <UNK> was not wife raped by <UNK> on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable <UNK> and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of portrayed by helen <UNK> she is presented as <UNK> wife together with <UNK> his sister in fact <UNK> married long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical <UNK> i also hated the moment with the killing machine a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts br br technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot <UNK> to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm <UNK> as <UNK> he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor <UNK> raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in <UNK> you may at least admire his performance i also <UNK> helen <UNK> as and <UNK> ann as <UNK> yet the film is based on a <UNK> by that <UNK> made love to his sister sir john gielgud as and peter o'toole as old are also memorable o'toole does his finest piece of acting in the <UNK> <UNK> sequence portraying the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about <UNK> are the performances therefore i don't rate the movie 1 10 br br lame continuity the historical <UNK> of the film also goes in <UNK> with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning <UNK> comes to <UNK> <UNK> where he sees the awful pleasures of old then after about 15 minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near <UNK> and <UNK> bed <UNK> a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in <UNK> where john gielgud is dying br br all in all i don't recommend to see <UNK> to anyone if you want to know the story read robert <UNK> gorgeous novel i <UNK> and <UNK> the god or watch herbert <UNK> mini series with the magnificent performance by derek <UNK> <UNK> is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epic br br there are movies that are truly artistic and <UNK> people's taste of beauty br br there are movies that are average entertainment yet they have something to offer br br there are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moral br br there are however movies that show sickness and <UNK> for their own sake and consequently harm people's minds br br <UNK> unfortunately belongs to the latest group
<START> as a fan of <UNK> i liked him in the millennium series and of course <UNK> <UNK> lamas i had expected at least something from this film sadly the plot is predictable the acting is bad and the used for most stunts don't work out sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from <UNK> flight <UNK> br br the cinematography sucks as well unnecessary funky <UNK> in the beginning only <UNK> from the cheesy dialogue and gives the film a cheap made for video look it works in <UNK> movies and jet li movies but seems out of place in this flick br br i would have liked this film 10 years ago i was 11 then
<START> this is by far probably the worst film al pacino could have starred in the movie had no real plot it kind of <UNK> into 24 different directions it seems that the target audience for this film are people from anonymous <UNK> <UNK> character is not believable enough to be <UNK> so he won a few <UNK> for some <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> to a <UNK> job recording on a <UNK> service does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills it was just plain stupid to think of the trailer did promise to show us how he makes his sure shot picks but after going through the whole film i have yet to see what skill if any he ever had if you want skill try looking at robert de <UNK> character in casino now that is <UNK> at some point in the film character picks his winning <UNK> at a flip of a <UNK> anybody could do that al pacino seems to talk a lot and i mean <UNK> mouth in your face dialog i think that style started with <UNK> of a woman and worked for him because he finally won an oscar but now i think its just irritating he seems to be always <UNK> he does do a mean act of portraying a man having unstable that's an impending heart attack its typically reminiscent of his acting in part 3 which he plays the aging <UNK> mafia don <UNK> but other than that <UNK> talent is wasted on this film <UNK> russo is just plain eye candy for this film she's kept in shape and shows it off in the tight clothes she wears throughout this film is plain crap do not waste your money on it it is much worse than the gambling picks of <UNK> character in the film
<START> this for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick and of course us americans just have to remake everything successful into english because man reading subtitles is <UNK> hard isn't it from what i've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant jessica alba well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it it looks exactly the same but probably w double the budget i thought the original was one of the best horror suspense mystery flicks i have seen in any language in quite a long while i would recommend watching that one and skipping this one all together there is no reason to watch this as there is no reason this even called the eye 2 except to capitalize on the excellence that was the first flick do yourself a favor watch the eye with the volume turned up and get ready for some <UNK> jumping i watched it w <UNK> on and was pleasantly surprised on the excellence that was the direction of the <UNK> brothers if the eye remake does well which i'm hoping it does for the sake of the <UNK> brothers movie careers but at the same time it seems a shame that people won't can't see the original because very often almost always the remake isn't as good as the original watch this one if one wants to be mildly kinda of boring flick but the original is no comparison to this sequel in name only flick
<START> not knowing a great deal about the truth and <UNK> <UNK> i can only look at this as a piece of entertainment i started watching it too late in the evening recorded from <UNK> earlier this year but once i'd started i had to watch to the end br br the down side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama never my favourite genre but it's stunningly photographed largely in super <UNK> and well acted like a good novel i couldn't put it down all the way through i wished i was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice what happened to its release in theatres i'm an admirer of since i saw him in dirty pretty things and <UNK> <UNK> looks terrific in this very female and sexy for a change possibly out of place but she adds to the visual <UNK> of the film br br this picture deserves a wider audience than it seems to be getting
<START> i really wanted to like this movie the previews looked <UNK> funny but i figured they put most of the funny stuff in the previews in this case they not only did that but they twisted the clips so that they appeared much funnier than they were in the real film i like john travolta uma thurman vince vaughn the rock cedric the entertainer etc so i wanted to like this movie but it just never seemed to do anything br br i saw get <UNK> and did not particularly care for it too slow and unfunny for me this movie is certainly no better and if anything is worse there were a lot of opportunities for some good comedic moments but it took none of them br br the acting was okay but even john travolta seemed toned down cedric was okay but he was too <UNK> in to be really funny vince vaughn and the rock were pretty good and ready to be funny but they just let it all pass them by i wish they had been given a chance to follow through with the funny things they set up but instead it just kept going back to the same old thing and back to just setting vaughn and rock up to be funny though never allowed to really deliver that punchline or comedy br br overall this was a very disappointing movie and i am glad i only saw it on video at least it was cheaper than the theater
<START> why bother <UNK> admittedly <UNK> park is the most difficult of the novels to get and <UNK> is certainly the hardest to like but if one is going to take it on then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit and for <UNK> sake have the guts to cast <UNK> as she was written a <UNK> good hearted <UNK> <UNK> mrs norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been and what the heck happened to the contrast between <UNK> rather dubious family and family home and the <UNK> of <UNK> is key to well so many aspects of <UNK> <UNK> of henry her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> near transformation to a good person etc etc again given the complexity and challenges of the novel why did they bother it's beyond me
<START> there are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this film suffice it to say that alex <UNK> plays a strong lead opposite robert ryan and arthur kennedy what concerns me is that many of you may not be aware of the at least two existing versions of this film in the u s version clay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> carter and then rides out of town redeemed i agree that ending is less than satisfying however in the original italian cut clay <UNK> rides out of town as he has turned in his <UNK> to the <UNK> and is by the bounty hunters that have been slowly the <UNK> town of the bounty killers are excited at the <UNK> of splitting the 10 000 reward but are disappointed to find <UNK> <UNK> in the corpses pocket as they ride away one is heard to comment if this <UNK> keeps up i'm gonna start hunting buffalo this alone takes a minute to pray a second to die and places it on an even playing field with movies like <UNK> and the big as the end credits say in the italian cut fine
<START> first off i'm in the u s br br when i first saw this i thought it was an obvious and <UNK> rip off of the office uk i would have thus awarded it zero stars but lo and behold it came out long before the ricky <UNK> series br br still it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic including the american office without comparison it just isn't even close to being the same thing br br i will give it some credit for being original and ahead of its time i'll also say that it and the u s office and larry sanders are actual <UNK> the uk office is something <UNK> and more <UNK> as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened however unlike this or the shrill christopher guest <UNK> it isn't really a satire while the definitely is br br be that as it may the still isn't very funny it's <UNK> and self aware but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to <UNK> the goods it's <UNK> comedy being carried on weak shoulders commendable but ultimately not recommended br br and what's with the lack of an <UNK> dvd i know it was shot in <UNK> widescreen because i saw the pilot episode on one of our <UNK> channels cbc get with the programme
<START> a classic 80's movie that disney for some reason stopped making i watched this movie everyday when i was in like <UNK> grade i found a copy myself after <UNK> video stores well worth it though one of my all time
<START> i don't see why all the people are giving this film negative reviews i loved this movie <UNK> is a form of abstract art and if you don't appreciate art i can see why you would not like this film it was a great twist from the average played out vampire movie if you are looking for a fresh new and ingenious new vampire movie then this is for you but if you want one of those turn into bats wolves and melt in the <UNK> movies then go watch your old played out dracula flicks sure it is a bit on the low budget side but they did a great job with the budget they had i'm very happy that i found this movie because i was about to give up on the vampire genre <UNK> good i thought this film was brilliant i give 2 thumbs up to the writer director and everyone involved in the film
<START> if it wasn't for colin <UNK> the movie would be ready for the dust bin so so silly and so badly acted only colin <UNK> as always shines through this mess as single light on the end of the tunnel br br the worst was jennifer <UNK> acting for sure maybe it was because of this script did they actually have really written one or was it just made up on the way br br to cut a <UNK> long story short br br it is a must see only for colin <UNK> fanatics like me since he is incredibly sexy and good acting struggling hard against this mentally challenged script these minutes of colin screen time make up a lot of this movie br br don't spend too much money on it though try to see or get it as cheap as possible an <UNK> or something like that and then do stick to the colin <UNK> scenes br br the rest of the movie might be dangerous for <UNK> mental health
<START> i saw bon voyage 2 days ago and i found it an excellent production the film is supposed to entertain and it does it <UNK> the style of the american screwball comedies of the 30s but von voyage is more <UNK> <UNK> and depardieu are simply excellent in their roles the plot is simple the film starts with people involved in many situations that apparently should have nothing to do between them it is very funny how those situations become linked during the film it is good to see a french film with this kind of sense of humor i find it <UNK> a film in which love is the main theme peter <UNK> as the german spy in france shows once more to be an excellent actor too
<START> this movie has the distinction of being the worst movie i have ever seen and the only film i have ever given a 1 out of 10 on imdb as of yet i was fooled into renting it because of the cool h r <UNK> cover art on the box this cover art is the only thing the least bit good about this steaming pile of br br it was about frat boys fighting freaks in a strange but not the least bit interesting post apocalyptic world where the cities are in ruins chaos but apparently the <UNK> are still a safe and wonderful place for young men to <UNK> other men into <UNK> frat <UNK> the most uninspiring performances by boring characters not so special effects dreary un original scenery and just generally extremely poor quality in all production aspects make this <UNK> the all time loser on my list br br final rating 1 10 i wish i could give it a zero br br <UNK>
<START> this movie is great from start to finish about a group of <UNK> students that get together and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then revive themselves they then research what happens from the near death experiences as each one goes through the experience they become haunted by their deepest fears that seem to <UNK> as reality this <UNK> from dead kids with hockey sticks to dead fathers that seem to be upstairs br br the cast is first rate and oliver <UNK> is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career i am not a big <UNK> sutherland fan but even he does an excellent job this is a movie that i can watch over and over
<START> the basic genre is a thriller <UNK> with an uncomfortable <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> has tried to make a lot more out of this using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists <UNK> designed to surprise the characters more than the audience br br it's really rather messy though <UNK> doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat edged rather his focus is on the moral <UNK> themselves br br the dialogue is inconsistent <UNK> here <UNK> there and with the constant surprise of realism <UNK> by the occasional cliché though there is no over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces there's also a very <UNK> dare i say it british feel to the filming i didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation i wanted to see some sort of <UNK> <UNK> of the story br br finally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an sum of subplots of different <UNK> and <UNK> woven as a vehicle for character examination <UNK> and watson support this <UNK> <UNK> with good performances and john <UNK> colleague simon to <UNK> is a welcome foil for much of the brow br br i'm disappointed not that it's bad but that it could have been much better 3 10
<START> so <UNK> remakes curse of the <UNK> a second time this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious <UNK> anti <UNK> and he adds a <UNK> most of the movie is spent listening to the self righteous characters <UNK> on about the evil <UNK> pigs while <UNK> between this <UNK> of <UNK> are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there <UNK> experiments were <UNK> <UNK> started to grow people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior <UNK> etc needless to say it would have been a much better movie if they would have made the flashbacks the movie and forgotten about the <UNK> do <UNK> <UNK> i forget there are a few short scenes scattered here and there where the <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> gets picked off one by one but they probably <UNK> less than 2 of the film the main event <UNK> our title characters against each other lasts about one minute and is as exciting as watching the previews for the latest <UNK> crisis video game br br the acting is pretty bad overall even for this sort of film half the actors seem like they're more concerned with <UNK> every last <UNK> of every word than speaking their dialog in any sort of believable manner br br i actually did make it through to the end but it's one of those movies i wish i would have recorded and then watched later because there are plenty of parts that need to be fast <UNK> through overall i give this effort one star it has absolutely none of the elements that make a b movie fun to watch it's a sad day indeed when you can say with sincerity that the makers of this movie could have learned a thing or two from watching <UNK> vs python
<START> put the film down and back slowly away the acting rivals a <UNK> play the plot is and the production values are slightly higher than community theater the goofs are so <UNK> that it becomes a <UNK> rooms are switched around the dead move dogs are used for wolves men shot point blank with 45 caliber <UNK> are able to walk and ride <UNK> <UNK> button and without human touch this is a movie i nearly passed out when i saw the average rating there is no <UNK> for taste btw there is no nudity
<START> i happened to catch this on tv and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based i was very disappointed first if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie it should be a sign that it's not exactly an a list production gregory hines was a world class dancer but sadly not a great actor br br in fact all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy which can only be blamed on the director who is this film's weakest link charles seemed to be trying to ape oliver <UNK> <UNK> in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the real child murderer s but without the benefit of a good script an a list cast or it must be said the talent it just doesn't work br br it's a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment
<START> i really hope the makers of these movies read these reviews so that they know that people just dont want their movies they are just trash and an embarrassment to the killer clown genre of horror whether or not this was better than the first doesn't matter cause both just plain terrible i'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie stop now warning to horror movie <UNK> dont watch rent or look at the boxes of urban horror films and above all don't buy them
<START> copy cats have copied this movie from a 1974 hindi movie called call girl call girl had an identical story line the way in which the protagonists fall in love then rebel and the climax all same in both these films call girl is better than water at least from the story telling point of view it was not as <UNK> slow as water water on the contrary does not progresses at all the aim is perhaps to make the audience sympathize with for ever are indian film makers any better than just being great <UNK> these days well they call it being inspired in their language it is getting inspired without any <UNK> that is
<START> full of surprises beautiful cruel at times just like life itself leaves one asking for more the best parts are of course the action scenes and chases have to really wonder how much work these guys put into making some scenes whale chases polar bear <UNK> etc it is a wonderful experience and not to be missed by anyone who <UNK> <UNK> or goes to the beach once in a while the music is <UNK> and the narration is superb and extremely well paced <UNK> one of the best documentaries ever made and worth not less than a very respectable 10 for its kind some of the footage is very cruel and might not be recommended for people with weak <UNK> every killer whale footage is cruel
<START> this focuses around the lives of four women all good friends and their male companions each has a story the men as well everything <UNK> everybody to everybody and everything is being brought to a quick change after a trip the girls take to palm springs br br basically the film is no different from other of the genre but i liked the details brooke <UNK> is a <UNK> that fears loneliness therefore she <UNK> just about everybody to get to have a warm body next to her in the morning but then can't really commit as a man i find these women are a <UNK> but she is not a happy person everything else that happens revolves around this crazy woman but in the end we get more clarity over life and relationships which is good br br i can't tell if the acting was bad it didn't seem to me the script was a little inconsistent but not more than any romantic comedy it's a bit more depressing than most which is good because you don't get dreary romantic comedies every day br br it's worth a watch with the especially if you have cheated on her or plan to
<START> mention bollywood to anyone with a slight <UNK> with the genre and the images usually <UNK> up are of tacky over the top musical numbers <UNK> with <UNK> that makes vegas seem a <UNK> of <UNK> this perception is not helped by the <UNK> of <UNK> that <UNK> most movies that have approached bollywood from an <UNK> perspective <UNK> <UNK> romantic comedy however takes a different <UNK> it is not a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of bollywood for its <UNK> its lack of irony and self consciousness br br it is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for bollywood while at the same time is <UNK> by its aspects and if you have a <UNK> with bollywood you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of bollywood and hollywood movie conventions from one of the opening shots a flashback of the salman character as a child by the sea talking with his grandmother played by helen how many salman movies start with this same premise to the flashback sequence that is <UNK> into the movie that and <UNK> has been filming anyone who has seen enough bollywood movies will recognize these references the story itself <UNK> tried and true conventions from both hollywood and bollywood as well  the fish out of water meets duty to one's family at the expense of personal <UNK> the structure of the film follows the typical bollywood plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of hollywood with its understated <UNK> humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself to reach self <UNK> br br you couldn't have a movie inspired by bollywood if there weren't any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them unlike bollywood however the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a european locale or beach they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in busby berkeley movies as being part of a stage show or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there  a sexy nightclub scene where <UNK> teaches to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians including a cameo from the <UNK> singer performing all reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other so in one of the highlights of the film where comes into her own the song is fairly typical of its genre  the female star singing and dancing among a line of women  but in this case it's blond ali looking like a total natural bollywood film star <UNK> and lip <UNK> to the hindi lyrics with no subtitles br br also <UNK> with bollywood are <UNK> visuals and <UNK> that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in bollywood today the cinematographer is anil <UNK> who was also the cinematographer for <UNK> and hum <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> the choreographer is <UNK> <UNK> and production designer is <UNK> both from hum <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> you can really see the influence of hum <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> on this film  in fact the <UNK> floor in one of the numbers was originally from <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> has an <UNK> pattern br br as for the cast <UNK> obviously has a <UNK> for <UNK> acting talent as <UNK> by playing by heart  one of the first movies for both angelina jolie and <UNK> and in this film he again hits the mark with ali one of the main reasons the film works is because of she makes a bitchy unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart funny and sexy because she is smart and funny she and salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the film's biggest strengths br br salman khan plays the role of prince charming here as <UNK> through his iconic role as <UNK> this is old school <UNK> however so expect a quiet subdued salman those used to him in his usual <UNK> <UNK> may be disappointed  or <UNK> it's a sincere and sensitive performance from him marred only by poor <UNK> of his english lines br br with a refreshing lack of cynicism and <UNK> embrace of romantic love the film is a love letter to bollywood and hollywood movies of <UNK>
<START> this is my favourite movie of all time and i always think of it as john <UNK> <UNK> br br i must have seen it at least 20 times and never tire of it the mood the script the singing the dinner it is like being invited into someone's home and <UNK> the events and not able to participate even though you want to it is a rare treasure this movie and i cannot write enough praise for it br br it is cast incredibly well with quite a few <UNK> theatre faces and also the wonderful <UNK> voice of frank <UNK> lady <UNK> poem <UNK> in the movie is one of the most moving ever written scene walking down the stairs as she <UNK> to the song is one of the best performances every seen on film i cry every time i see it for all the right reasons br br we have all had love lost at an early age and <UNK> for our young hopeful <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> acted in far too few movies for my liking he just loved stage work and stuck to it and it is our loss that we do not have more of his performances on film as he does so much with this delicate role by expression and the portrayal of a deep love for his wife that will never be <UNK> and he conveys such inner sadness at knowing this br br if you want your movies action and plot packed avoid this there really is no beginning middle or end just a lens onto the characters at a dinner party in <UNK> 80 years ago and all the little nuances and <UNK> of the personalities portrayed so beautifully br br bravo to all who were involved in this production 10 out of 10
<START> an extremely gentle retelling of the shakespeare play and much more overt about it than forbidden planet cassavetes is always a joy to watch and even more so with gena rowlands sharing the spotlight his take on the <UNK> role is well suited for the sort of <UNK> all knowing expression he brings to the story this especially comes to the <UNK> in a scene when upon <UNK> his estranged wife and her lover in a <UNK> he <UNK> up a storm accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from go this is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely <UNK> and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe add to this an excellent performance by <UNK> julia plus good work by susan sarandon <UNK> <UNK> and molly <UNK> and the film becomes a nice little treat to <UNK> the space behind your eyes
<START> as a modern <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> to china here we come again taking on the task to render us the grey area in the middle of two worlds in solid colors <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> vision of europe is mutual with br br the view of that charming but puzzling country is dealt from below devoid of any claim to learn or <UNK> opinions reality nonetheless is harsh abandoned and exploited children <UNK> homes <UNK> areas is the other china we ignore vincenzo <UNK> a <UNK> of a steel factory is one of us his voyage to china is a <UNK> to understand to learn from the inside a country where progress and third world problems live together in an infamous balance it's not exactly clear if vincenzo knew by the first time that the mechanical <UNK> was already been fixed i think so anyway is a minor aspect liu the chinese girl is the key of the whole film she carries on her back a lot of difficulties she's got the strength to overcome but how could she fight with little money and little help br br the realistic and <UNK> view of the facts by the girl <UNK> <UNK> money touched me a lot a pack of bank notes can't get back her husband her baby forced to treat like a stranger for the law protect her by <UNK> liu knew his intentions were <UNK> and kind far from a cold charity act their friendship is beautifully narrated the way it grows step by step <UNK> and <UNK> unique a priceless legacy to keep br br some scenes are stunning either for the acting vincenzo crying on the ferry or by the dialogues at the restaurant on the <UNK> besides a <UNK> editing and a pretty lazy start la stella che non is brilliant and sharp just because chronicles the <UNK> br br in competition at <UNK> <UNK> film festival plenty bet on <UNK> <UNK> for the mastroianni prize dedicated to <UNK> stars she definitely deserved that award br br 8 10
<START> i never made any comment here on imdb but as i saw this movie i cant be quiet i just set up my account here only because this horrible movie in two words this movie is pure crap the movie has no sense at all nothing makes sense in this movie watching this movie was pain all the way i don't understand why val kilmer agreed to do this movie he plays a minor role as a gang leader says few words and he is there like 5 minutes total br br i bought this dvd based only because of val kilmer name on the box and the interesting pictures on the cover br br as was stated in other review <UNK> zero stole my money and i want it back the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it zero
<START> this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldn't go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far and it's a far more zany ride br br essentially the film is a science fiction set in future shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where it's illegal to <UNK> sho <UNK> a similar role from dead or alive 2 and <UNK> is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isn't one to give all of his reasons to you on a <UNK> but one can assume that the law on <UNK> <UNK> by giving people the <UNK> is there because of over population <UNK> life <UNK> and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly <UNK> whilst sho and <UNK> who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have <UNK> the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was anti homosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be left wing but i can't see this film as an insult to <UNK> he merely calls back <UNK> of ancient <UNK> when <UNK> or <UNK> was more common the film contains similar proportions of action packed and poignant moments to <UNK> 2 although in this film the action is more martial arts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with <UNK> shots a good control on colours to give the air a <UNK> look and it's nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically there's a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments it's a great finish to the series you could <UNK> it for being a bit cheesy but isn't that part of the charm
<START> i expected so much more than what i received from watching this movie it is not that i object to literary license if that is what it should be called especially when there is no overt attempt to say based on a true story but this movie is about <UNK> a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply <UNK> into our musical experiences and i expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements this movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint br br my <UNK> because i had not <UNK> the movie at all was that it was true half way through i stopped the movie to look it up on imdb the rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience i was <UNK> that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story to enjoy this movie i was required to recognize it as a fantasy a what if it was like this story the movie lacked this honest <UNK> br br what disappointed me most was the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> the very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of <UNK> i ended up <UNK> anything was true to history other than <UNK> van <UNK> and his relationship with karl van <UNK> br br i really enjoyed the performance of ed harris an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that i give it a 3 10 br br those who that this movie is as good as or better than <UNK> have not a clue about either either <UNK> life and are looking only for what this movie really is for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story pulp fiction
<START> straight from the brilliant mind of animation <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> as it is known nowadays stands as a masterpiece of stop motion animation that sadly has been almost forgotten by now nevertheless the work of this man deserves to be seen and in fact must be seen to be believed because the outstanding way the animation flows is simply unbelievable br br decades before toy story <UNK> conceived the idea of moving toys in he tells the story of a small stuffed dog that gets makes friends with the sick daughter of his maker one day his maker takes him away to sell him and the adventure begins as he tries to find his way back home in his odyssey he'll travel from paris to hell and will find the other toys that were supposed to be sold with him br br it is a surreal experience to watch this movie as <UNK> makes every imaginable creature come alive with grace and beauty the other toys include a beautiful <UNK> who loves a thief but she also is secretly loved by a clown <UNK> a love triangle an old woman a stuffed cat and a stuffed ape complete the group every toy is so detailed and very <UNK> that without words one can understand their motives br br truly the surreal atmosphere the whole animation has it is remarkable it is hard to believe that a work of this <UNK> was done in 1934 since it looks even better than most of the current day animation the influence it has in modern day animator such as tim burton and henry <UNK> is very significant br br this short is a masterpiece of animation and the outstanding work of one genius who done everything by himself and that has influenced animators for decades <UNK> work is an immortal piece of art that should be seen by everyone this work is not only for kids adults as well will enjoy it and probably catch most of the subtext hidden in the movie br br it is possible to find it in the <UNK> dvd as a bonus feature anyone with the slightest interest in animation should give it a look
<START> one should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the second coming and the third testament that they had read the other two or at least knew a little more about them than <UNK> and judgement day this film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in jesus religion or philosophy there is only the standard british social realism with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> characters in <UNK> br br actually good candidates for a real third testament have been published several times like a course in <UNK> or conversations with god they all have thought provoking new twists and angles for christian faith and <UNK> br br the most interesting information in <UNK> rating is not the number of stars but how many people who have bothered to vote in four years only people have bothered to vote for this film as usual the <UNK> are the most eager for comparison have a look at jesus christ superstar original version from 1973
<START> this film <UNK> dear irony shaggy dog <UNK> story lines woven with subtle cultural references classic parallels masterful use of rich <UNK> color and fabulous rendition of chase scenes <UNK> <UNK> cops br br the ensemble work of the cast and entire crew is charming literally how else could i go on so br br this film speaks to everyone the <UNK> and poignant use of so many universal <UNK> that's what makes this film so deep down satisfying br br as a mature student of film i find checking out contains all the vital elements sure and it's not the godfather but would serve perfectly as follow up mandatory play that <UNK> <UNK> our collective <UNK> wounds br br get <UNK> to a theatre and see this film you will be treated to a unique masterpiece
<START> i got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma com with the ruining which isn't much better the main reason i wanted it was to see star worms ii attack of the pleasure <UNK> the dvd is a double feature with that movie i really didn't know what <UNK> was at the time and when i saw the trailer i got scared it looked awful but hey what can you tell from the trailer well apparently i could tell a lot this movie honestly made no <UNK> to me the special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in god's name is going on i understand mark <UNK> had a extremely low budget but come on and it is sad because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see but sadly watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone's life it is so utterly painful to sit through i really can't even explain the plot to you because i didn't understand it at all and i have sadly seen this film two times apparently they used some type of puppets for the alien dinosaurs like they did in star wars but these special effects are awful i can't stress it enough and most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly it takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in <UNK> run around and they look like they are in the <UNK> and some box with a blue light on it is the president i know in the interview mark <UNK> said something about making this a television pilot well i can see why this didn't make it to cbs or nbc there are two good things about this film 1 the music is actually pretty good it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days and 2 lloyd <UNK> introduction is as always hilarious overall don't waste your time but check out star worms ii attack of the pleasure <UNK>
<START> in the 1980's <UNK> and in some cases flat out <UNK> was pretty high do we get to win this time a line famous from rambo first blood part ii could almost sum up how many people felt at that time a longing for the style of films they grew up with flat out balls to the wall we're good your bad now let's blow something up and go home while rambo rocky and for the most part top gun seemed more <UNK> towards <UNK> an older crowd iron eagle went straight for the kids canadian writer and director sidney j <UNK> brings out everything that you love and hate about that time period the kick in the pants rock out 80's <UNK> never say die road of the gypsy etc to the over the top and sometimes almost unbelievable action adventure iron eagle succeeded for one reason it was f u n fun it's the type of movie you can turn on and sit back and enjoy every ridiculous totally 80's moment you don't have to think about if it could really happen or if the acting is truly believable it's just fun and that's all you can really ask for in this type of movie
<START> so i was sick with the <UNK> one saturday and the silver <UNK> was that scifi channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day the <UNK> trilogy <UNK> <UNK> island then i <UNK> ahead on my cable remote to see which movie scifi placed in its glamorous saturday prime time <UNK> some movie i had never heard of before called <UNK> i was pretty excited the movie begins with some teens driving around in a <UNK> when they get stalked and killed by a <UNK> i was like hmmm that's odd that looks almost exactly like a scene in <UNK> except it was in the middle of that movie then i sat through some really bad acting and then some guy was <UNK> into walking into an underground research laboratory where he got eaten by a <UNK> t rex now i'm like wait a second that was also a scene in <UNK> then after i saw some scenes blatantly ripped off from <UNK> 2 i figured out just what the hell was going on so basically roger corman co ripped off scenes from the <UNK> trilogy to use as the action scenes <UNK> in a basic dinosaur runs amok plot and tried to pass it off as an original movie shameful i don't know who i'm more angry at roger corman or scifi channel for trying to pass this off as worthy of the prime time <UNK> the only reason why this was worth watching to its conclusion was to pick out the actors actresses who looked like their counterparts in the <UNK> trilogy and guess which scenes would be lifted next as much as it pains me being a dinosaur lover i have no choice but to give this the lowest possible rating because i feel completely ripped off
<START> very funny film with some of the best swedish actors it's all filmed in black and white with the true 40 ish feeling most of the film you are aboard a train headed for berlin in 1945 among a mixture of characters from <UNK> to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns i truly recommend this film if you like to laugh
<START> this is one of peter <UNK> best movies why is it never shown on tv or movie theaters will it ever be released as a home movie is it too <UNK> for the medical field i would love to see this movie again i would like my son who is a doctor to see it laughter is the best medicine and peter sellers is the best doctor for this
<START> so what is <UNK> anyway br br it was <UNK> as an action film and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film but really there isn't that much action and tim burton barely seems interested in it br br people often <UNK> it with the superhero comics of the late eighties but honestly if you've read 'the dark knight that seems just a little absurd <UNK> excessive <UNK> have more in common with the day <UNK> sixties tv series the penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck for <UNK> sake br br <UNK> style is often described as gothic and that's a little closer to what we see on screen the penguin <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> history and a <UNK> <UNK> is a gothic menace dressed up in more respectable <UNK> clothes <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> br br but what of <UNK> she may be raised from the dead but that <UNK> is decidedly <UNK> century and her alter ego <UNK> <UNK> world is all and apartments reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy br br and then it <UNK> the smart but <UNK> secretary <UNK> by a lonely millionaire the ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise <UNK> is quite clearly a romantic comedy in the old hollywood style <UNK> through <UNK> s m <UNK> sensibilities it has more in common with 'the <UNK> including <UNK> sets than it does with other superhero films br br like many a romantic comedy it <UNK> around the make over of the heroine not from ugly <UNK> to <UNK> but from <UNK> to <UNK> michelle pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her often remarkable career she's sexy as <UNK> poor <UNK> <UNK> never had a <UNK> playful and <UNK> memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body in retrospect though it's her scenes as <UNK> that impress almost every one of them is a little comic gem particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life it's a <UNK> balanced performance and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life nothing moves me quite like <UNK> and bruce wayne dancing under the to and the <UNK> a gun held between them simultaneously <UNK> and trapped by their alter <UNK> doomed to conflict forget the easy sentimentality of <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> emotions of <UNK> <UNK> this is the most heartfelt scene in all of <UNK> films love revenge <UNK> <UNK> insanity self loathing and not a little wit all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors particularly pfeiffer br br elsewhere danny de <UNK> almost matches her finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly <UNK> long <UNK> the upper <UNK> villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a <UNK> <UNK> penguin is a <UNK> creature subjected to his own <UNK> <UNK> style make over almost literally an <UNK> it's <UNK> most radical and funniest <UNK> christopher <UNK> max <UNK> <UNK> a perfect <UNK> of villains <UNK> between casual charm and blank eyed <UNK> with unnerving ease and is it just me or does his <UNK> <UNK> bring to mind mickey mouse perhaps we should ask former disney animator burton br br christopher <UNK> <UNK> a real action film has been much praised as the first film to do justice to batman i admire <UNK> film but it would be a pity if it were allowed to <UNK> this <UNK> gem
<START> i just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is just br br the memory of this movie right now <UNK> me if you want to br br see a sweeping epic of a movie with wonderful actors in vivid br br scenery with great dialogue reminding you of what early america br br could have been like what the world could have been like back br br then well i highly recommend this movie especially during a br br time of war and conflict in iraq when our american image is not at br br all what it used to be this movie takes you back to a time when we br br were just starting out when being an american meant really br br picking yourself up by your <UNK> and getting going when br br the world was such an <UNK> and unknown place well this br br movie has that and more enjoy
<START> a true stand out episode from season 1 is what ice is an <UNK> location claustrophobic conditions and a general feel of paranoia <UNK> in the <UNK> air makes this is a must see episode from season one the previous <UNK> of the <UNK> station <UNK> <UNK> and four others go to have either killed each other or killed themselves a virus is bringing out murderous <UNK> and is responsible for bringing out deadly paranoia and fear <UNK> and <UNK> actually begin to question each others sanity tension is that high the writers have to receive great credit for creating that sort of scenario where the atmosphere is so tense <UNK> and <UNK> come into conflict in such a direct manner
<START> how many <UNK> know about this lets keep it that way i wonder at least some new dialogues can be made or not the movie is a real poor copy of the original bruce willis probably did this movie while he was half asleep the way he looks at richard <UNK> face with his cold blooded stare when they meet near the <UNK> oh my god scared the hell out of me why does he kill major and her mates isn't still clear to me another thing that i could not understand was the poison solution that he put on the car what in the world was it br br the movie plot is <UNK> and climax is dull another funny thing was how the russian was killed in the club i fell off my chair laughing when i saw that scene also what was that thing about the gay guy what purpose was it serving i think the movie is made too swift to be easily understood you have to really think what the hell was on director's mind lol br br and the best scene after all was richard gere trying to hold on to the <UNK> between 2 fast moving trains must have made someone loose his head if not contact with the <UNK>
<START> hilarious film i had a great time watching it the star arkin sometimes credited as steve arkin is a popular actor from turkey he has played in lots of tough guy roles epic sword films and romances it was fun to see him with an international cast and some real lousy looking pair of <UNK> if i remember it was also dubbed in english which made things even more funnier kinda like seeing john wayne speak turkish
<START> first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie perhaps though it should've been a two <UNK> for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and <UNK> i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that's a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy <UNK> are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sad br br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints the actress who played <UNK> vance not great casting at all and the switch from <UNK> <UNK> to rachel york <UNK> like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person that wasn't too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy <UNK> no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a <UNK> to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy <UNK> had there been more time had the story been more about <UNK> entire life then maybe the kids <UNK> been there more but they weren't so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red <UNK> and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in <UNK> life really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i don't think i'll ever watch this again and i don't think this <UNK> be that memorable for someone who <UNK> i love lucy but isn't an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
<START> for many years samuel tried to bring his friend <UNK> to the screen one evening when <UNK> and his wife frances were having dinner with and his wife silent screen star <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that star in a movie after some <UNK> agreed on the condition that his acting be kept to a minimum and the movie originally titled music school was born br br the story itself is rather stock a <UNK> boy gene reynolds who is best known as the producer of m a s h runs away from home and ends up at a <UNK> troubled music school run by professor <UNK> walter brennan while attempting to raise <UNK> for the school the boy and some other kids happen across at <UNK> hall after much <UNK> ends up appearing at the school concert and <UNK> the school br br the story while predictable is surprisingly well written although the film contains several minor <UNK> where different scenes were <UNK> together the most obvious being the young <UNK> who is sent out of the orchestra room on an <UNK> and is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later br br what is not surprising is how good the acting is as was <UNK> for studios then the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent brennan joel <UNK> <UNK> porter hall <UNK> main later of ma and <UNK> <UNK> fame arthur <UNK> paul harvey and a who's who of character actors actress diana <UNK> and singer actress <UNK> connor made their uncredited <UNK> in this film as did longtime nelson eddy singing partner <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> child veteran actors reynolds walter and terry also appear br br <UNK> hired the peter <UNK> a highly regarded youth orchestra from the los angeles area to appear in the film most of the kids in the orchestra weren't actors but they were excellent musicians as good as professionals which many of them later became many of the kids in the orchestra went on to noteworthy careers <UNK> connor and diana <UNK> both starred in the theater and movies richard was a producer and director mitchell <UNK> <UNK> a well known music supply company elliott <UNK> went on to be a prominent lewis <UNK> was a band leader thomas a conductor with different <UNK> <UNK> robbins a prominent <UNK> at the <UNK> school his sister <UNK> robbins an <UNK> <UNK> and many of the kids in the orchestra pursued musical careers with major <UNK> <UNK> br br while acting was kept to a minimum his <UNK> wasn't he <UNK> 70 000 for seven weeks when some scenes had to be re shot at a later date he got an additional 50 000 for another four weeks what thankfully wasn't kept to a minimum was his musical <UNK> composer alfred <UNK> who was once a orchestra conductor handled the <UNK> performs the and <UNK> by <UNK> saint his own <UNK> of <UNK> with an off screen teddy accompanying <UNK> difficult <UNK> from a <UNK> recording with <UNK> bay at the piano an <UNK> from <UNK> melody an <UNK> arranged for <UNK> solo from <UNK> well known from his <UNK> 11 string <UNK> played during the opening credits at the beginning of the movie and the final movement from felix e minor <UNK> <UNK> during all of these performances there are many closeups of performing including some very close shots of his <UNK> and <UNK> something that would be of value to <UNK> to study his technique br br the orchestra also shines here performing the <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> by both with <UNK> singing an <UNK> of the <UNK> from <UNK> of <UNK> a short <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the previously mentioned <UNK> with diana <UNK> can be heard in the background of one scene performing part of <UNK> in b flat minor and a five year old mary ruth performs popular minute <UNK> br br all in all this is an excellent movie <UNK> showed this regularly up until early 1992 i haven't seen it on television in recent years but copies of it are not difficult to obtain if you have the chance i highly recommend that you view the movie
<START> peak practice was a british drama series about a <UNK> surgery in  a small fictional town in the peak district  and the doctors who worked there it ran on <UNK> from 1993 to 2002 and was one of their most successful series at the time it originally starred kevin <UNK> as dr jack amanda burton as dr beth glover and simon shepherd as dr will preston though the <UNK> of doctors would change many times over the course of the series br br the series was <UNK> in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main characters <UNK> off a cliff viewers wrote to <UNK> in their thousands and a <UNK> for one last episode was set up by website peak practice online however all <UNK> were <UNK> and <UNK> said they would not make any more episodes br br peak practice was replaced by sweet medicine another medical series set in it lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the <UNK> br br was based on the village of and the series was filmed there and at other nearby towns and <UNK> most notably <UNK> and after the end of this programme <UNK> attempted to launch a follow up series called sweet medicine which extended the stories of different characters from the original show
<START> this is my favorite game for the <UNK> 64 platform i've played many different first person <UNK> and i've never really liked any of them much but this game has a certain something that i can't put my finger on that makes it an amazing amount of fun maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters maybe it's the <UNK> and weapons maybe it's the suave character of james bond whatever it is this game never seems to get old no matter how many times i've played it
<START> although it has been a failure in movie theaters because mainly farmer one of the 3 top stars in france had not the first role fans had changed their mind after that and were waiting for it on dvd when it has been released on dvd this year it has have a tremendous success the others fails was the slow pace and the incredible length at that time 1994 that have annoyed critics but the <UNK> story makes mandatory that slow pace and long time the moral of the film is you cannot escape from the death you are destined for it is the same theme than in the movie final destination and makes it a gothic tale the atmosphere is very <UNK>
<START> in <UNK> the <UNK> rule and are constantly at war with the christians and who inhabit the southern portion of this east african country this film follows a group of of boys a tribe of cattle whom were left <UNK> after their village was destroyed and their families killed in a brutal attack carried out by the arab forces most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed the lost boys br br the filmmaker follows a group of the lost boys on their journey as they have been accepted as <UNK> in the us where they will land in <UNK> those who've been accepted as <UNK> gain celebrity status as they feel from what they've heard that america is amazing making a trip from <UNK> to america is like making a trip to heaven says the one young man a huge party is thrown for their departure and they are told to do <UNK> well and once they have been educated to return to <UNK> so that they can contribute to society they are also warned not to be like those with the <UNK> pants whom are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men and also no matter what happens not to forget the culture br br you watch as the boys come from a third world country into america and how they attempt to <UNK> into american society as they have gone from a place with practically nothing to this <UNK> world where everything is <UNK> <UNK> and they are taught about <UNK> and how to use all the <UNK> that we take for granted on a daily basis it is humorous at times <UNK> at others br br listening to the comments they make about black americans and american society culture are quite interesting as the film progresses you see how american culture begins to corrupt their previously humble ways of thinking br br one of the boys peter is not content with working and making just enough to survive so he up and moves from <UNK> to kansas city so that he can pursue an education when the other boys visit him they talk about how they cannot get into any schools the main reason they came to america was to get an education and the media is saying that the boys have been brought from <UNK> for an education this is occurring because the boys were given <UNK> ages making them older than they actually are <UNK> them from being able to <UNK> in high school br br the film <UNK> images from <UNK> to kansas we watch as peter <UNK> in school where he befriends a group of christian conservative kids and as <UNK> attempts driving school even though he drives without his license anyways and works at <UNK> we see peter struggle with high school life as he <UNK> to make his schools basketball team and as <UNK> has trouble keeping up with work the rent <UNK> tensions back home in <UNK> and most of all <UNK> with loneliness br br it comes to the point where the boys want to return to <UNK> and tell them that everything they are taught about america there is lies you must make it alone here do everything alone one of the boys says a <UNK> message to a liberal <UNK> lifestyle showing how it causes people to become radical a trend which led to the creation of both the neo conservative and radical <UNK> movements their biggest <UNK> with america though is that there is no time time is money and we don't waste a second br br despite all this the boys never lose their sense of culture they celebrate southern <UNK> <UNK> day which marks the day which the began to fight in <UNK> a fight which continues today they also meet with other lost boys on the <UNK> of their arrival in america where they discuss their experience in america as compared to back in <UNK> when asked one boy says that if he were able to make a living he would much prefer to live in <UNK> it is much too lonely in america he adds they never lose their sense of community which has been <UNK> into them as part of their culture br br this film makes us question the way we live makes us question the artificial happiness that <UNK> and the nature of our societies has created within us it will also change the way i look at <UNK> i will never again take for granted how hard they must work and what immigrants mean for a country such as my own canada this is a wonderful film i laughed i cried a very emotional journey and a very well made documentary 10 out of 10
<START> sure i like some indie films a lot actually i don't always understand them and that's okay not all of them were meant to be understood especially by mainly main stream people like me i'm probably showing my ignorance but i'm still puzzled why <UNK> of is called that i love those end of world stories and the only thing i could see similar to the end of the world and this film was the torture it took to get through this i'm not talking about the subject matter perhaps i've been subdued from all the other torture porn i've seen it was just the incredibly slow story one hour 15 minute material stretched for nearly two hours major spoilers lie ahead <UNK> man dancer gets <UNK> <UNK> and raped six ways from sunday or in this case 12 days by three <UNK> women upon his release after his somewhat <UNK> dancer girlfriend barely <UNK> other than dropping a glass after wondering which she missed more him or the <UNK> she originally sent him for upon <UNK> still in a state of reasonable shock he refuses to talk and she goes on to work without so much a hug as if nothing happened and he takes a well needed shower problem as much as he's tormented through the flashbacks to his uh attacks he's as equally <UNK> granted i haven't been bound and used as a <UNK> but i doubt i would really be in the mood oh i forgot and how does he try and solve this crime sleep with as many women as he can to try and spot the <UNK> or the criminals had i see where they're going with it  show a gang rape from the male <UNK> fine twist notwithstanding you could never feel for this guy only saving grace was the good acting of the dancer cancer <UNK> but even she couldn't save the film
<START> john huston was seriously ill when he made his final achievement and it's thoroughly his testament <UNK> difficult a thousand miles away from <UNK> and fashions it will stand as the best last film you can ever dream of a very <UNK> screenplay no action no real hero but a group of people <UNK> with the vanity of life the fleeting years and death the party doesn't <UNK> people for long admittedly warmth and affection from the songs and the meal complete with turkey and <UNK> but the passage of time has partly ruined <UNK> voice first crack in the mirror then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered and <UNK> the old <UNK> bedroom for sure hers seems to have been a happy life but it's a life <UNK> coming to an end a shot shows towards the end of the movie julia on her future <UNK> maybe an <UNK> life because she remained a <UNK> with no children to carry on only some poor things <UNK> photographs and but are a human <UNK> hopes and dreams all <UNK> look at <UNK> she 's a married woman about thirty five she's still beautiful and healthy but she knows something is broken what julia is today she will be tomorrow that's why in her stream of consciousness she goes back to her past only to find out how harrowing her memories are a young man committed suicide for her a symbol of her youth now <UNK> the final monologue if we listen closely to it involves us all in this eternal tragedy the doomed to failure human condition john <UNK> <UNK> lesson
<START> when it was released in the beginning of the 80's <UNK> brings to brazilian society the problems of young <UNK> and the impact of this in brazilian society i can't watch the movie at that time cause i was too young but now i got a chance and watched it a few days ago it's a very brutal movie but everything is absolutely true and sad <UNK> is the name of a 12 year old boy who lives in the streets and survive with he stays for a while in a house of <UNK> and when he left it he continues to plan <UNK> with other <UNK> and a prostitute played by the boy is still a marijuana addicted and smell <UNK> with another teenagers to forget his sad reality the quality of the images it's not the best but the movie is totally realistic about brazilian problems and must be viewed and admired
<START> jean <UNK> homage to the paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways not only does it appear to have been photographed by <UNK> <UNK> and it portrays the <UNK> paris the streets accessible only by <UNK> the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual <UNK> of men with a product to sell in an <UNK> picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by hollywood there is an obvious comparison to be made with lloyd <UNK> <UNK> street which had been made about 20 years before featuring ruby keeler as a dancing sensation a fresh faced kid from the sticks who had come to new york to get into show business who saves the show when the star fails you're going out there a kid from the chorus but you've got to come back a star warner <UNK> julian <UNK> is a director who suffers for his art and is <UNK> jean keeps running <UNK> of <UNK> politics but when he talks about the show he is more like than like julian <UNK> he's all about the game except for his <UNK> thing he has a <UNK> new venture up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she <UNK> as his next mistress his <UNK> rise and fall with every <UNK> journey he takes br br takes mistress 1 lola de castro played by maria felix <UNK> to a dive where he sees <UNK> with her boyfriend and first lover <UNK> the baker and discovers that she is a spirited dancer he uses his charm and the <UNK> of money to lure to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage the <UNK> of money and fame charms and she become next mistress as well as an apt student of the <UNK> which has dubbed french <UNK> to <UNK> to the current <UNK> tendency in the dance br br both <UNK> st and french <UNK> are <UNK> to show business to modern entertainment that has is own <UNK> and its own <UNK> <UNK> st is centered around julian <UNK> a great director of broadway shows which he <UNK> with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement the male juvenile is a middle aged <UNK> with replaced by dick powell the pretty <UNK> with secret wealth to hide on the other hand goes from woman to woman <UNK> them with the promise of fame <UNK> them with what must have been a very <UNK> <UNK> one has no doubt that he is <UNK> and quite active scenes abound br br days after <UNK> away from <UNK> he has discovered esther a <UNK> type and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the film's theme song while he plays it on her <UNK> that of course <UNK> jealousy just as she has <UNK> the jealousy of lola and of course had already the <UNK> of being a the whole movie is about how has cost him money but how even his <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> to his love for the show how the audience demands devotion and it is this potent combination of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> fame that makes the hero while <UNK> that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men at the movie's conclusion having the <UNK> and the jealous babes approaches a new attraction watching the incredible and believe me it is incredible performance of the <UNK> have you ever thought about being on the stage he asks and the curtain <UNK> meanwhile poor julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to peggy new fans <UNK> his contribution to the show's success i won't even go into <UNK> street 's central line oh guy it was grand of you to come br br furthermore i won't go into the glimpse one gets of legendary <UNK> <UNK> including a brief vision of <UNK> nor of the vision of a paris both urban and rural certainly there is a <UNK> of the styles that <UNK> and but it is the <UNK> of an <UNK> and welcome <UNK> something unseen in any hollywood musical with which it might be compared is a pleasant relief from the of 30's hollywood musicals including my beloved fred astaire not to mention dick powell let alone the <UNK> <UNK> by mgm in movies like the repulsive american in paris all those <UNK> we'll save our comparison of that turkey to breakfast at <UNK> and its <UNK> of the american male for another day br br that may have been a hopeful vision in <UNK> france of a kind of hyper <UNK> that may or may not have ever existed is practically beside the point that he is a man's man neither john wayne nor edward everett <UNK> is perhaps more on target that he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question i for one wouldn't mind living his life at all i wonder if <UNK> was that lucky br br at the beginning of this comment i wanted to talk about <UNK> and what <UNK> lewis called i never got that far <UNK> <UNK> well paris doesn't put that kind of stuff in the <UNK> anymore
<START> i love <UNK> this movie my peers always try their best to defend it probably out of love for quentin tarantino or harvey keitel but they'll never convince me that this one should be <UNK> here's some huge reasons why a the plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set up whatsoever suddenly something very real turns into something very fake which is like sitting the audience down to a <UNK> feast then exploding it with dynamite b that <UNK> juliette lewis is in it c preposterous ideas abound such as actual <UNK> and leg <UNK> brothers with the last name <UNK> bad vampire make up jobs cheech <UNK> playing three characters and a <UNK> based gun that only fires when <UNK> and belongs to a guy who goes by sex machine if robert rodriguez didn't <UNK> try to be so innovative with his violence i <UNK> had fun with this obvious popcorn flick the whole like he got the ideas by playing with action figures the only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is george <UNK> laugh out loud cheesy monologue after he kills his blood sucking horny for children terrible acting brother i swear i think they thought it up right then and there this movie's out to offend and ends up <UNK> those who want the offensive horrible movie
<START> you've got to be kidding this movie sucked for the sci fi fans i would only recommend watching this only if you think <UNK> was good
<START> my guess is that the producers of this low budget space horror film wanted a serious movie but the director had his heart set on a parody so this is what we get set in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and <UNK> with characters and props right out of the 90's the set is some industrial complex maybe an oil <UNK> whatever they use is as is so the controls consist <UNK> of old tv equipment one location is obviously the employees <UNK> and sports an old tv and vcr as well as a water <UNK> with plastic tiny <UNK> and <UNK> get the best lines arguing throughout the story the dialog is packed with terms that are pretty dated even now a ok daddy o but then maybe the <UNK> century is very retro when the captain declares the ships <UNK> is a load of <UNK> from the <UNK> station you know this is all a put on its a bit of alien part <UNK> shameless rip off of all the best sci fi and horror titles at one point casper even tells his pilot to make it so with a straight face this film would have been better if they had just let everyone run with the satire but they keep attempting to make the story serious maybe the <UNK> were on the set that day anyway not a bad boredom killer if you aren't too <UNK> fx are as good as the sets are bad
<START> i had nothing to do before going out one night so i didn't want to watch anything too heavy i picked the perfect film this must have been a gift to barrymore from someone she slept with the director <UNK> has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious in what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former <UNK> they let kids all come to the prom with no shirts in skin tight <UNK> ass shorts and one girl was dressed as eve wearing only <UNK> leaves she <UNK> that she's 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no from the school parents or <UNK> of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or <UNK> the newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an <UNK> sex scandal but doesn't realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be <UNK> they allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to <UNK> with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my <UNK> use i would not get in some kind of trouble no problem didn't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point the secondary characters in this were like cardboard <UNK> of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this <UNK> for the camera at every chance in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom and they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had <UNK> my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life this movie is so contrived and predictable it's nauseating and why at the end is everybody the <UNK> girls included cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her br br dumb dumb and dumb
<START> stephen seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an <UNK> car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path however the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and seagal <UNK> a rat who gave the police advanced notice the story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner poor seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time in this film seagal tries to be a good guy but the forces of evil are against him unfortunately this is not a great film and rather boring and too long
<START> the voyage here is a search for god the big guy in the sky the big cheese with a beard <UNK> disguised as the <UNK> for ultimate knowledge taking over from leonard <UNK> in the directing chair is the <UNK> himself captain william shatner kirk in an attempt at <UNK> the fun corny aspects of the series with sci fi <UNK> <UNK> dialogue <UNK> really shatner and his co writers have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody where's the danger where's the brothers in arms spirit in fact where is our badly <UNK> crew star trek humour is a wonderful thing when it's in the right places and done with a straight <UNK> so <UNK> what has come before the final frontier some light moments exist but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments while do we really need another spock revelation really br br some nice sets and little <UNK> trek moments aside the final frontier is just a bad movie experience 3 10
<START> bad movie bad go stand in a <UNK> bin <UNK> top should really stick to low lit comedy <UNK> it's movies like this that make old jerry lewis films look like shakespeare and john <UNK> like john barrymore <UNK> smith a fine talent is absolutely wasted her purpose seems mainly to look pretty and oblivious br br the only enjoyable things about the movie is seeing <UNK> welch doing an <UNK> <UNK> type role and <UNK> harris as a <UNK> of a <UNK> the only way i can imagine someone thinking it would be a good idea to make this beyond <UNK> film is if the <UNK> fourth grade child was allowed to pick the script well maybe his third <UNK> what this film really needs is to be <UNK> in the <UNK> of its creators
<START> as much as i hate to disagree with the original poster i found <UNK> and the <UNK> quite good and a huge step above previous attempts at <UNK> everyone's favorite br br for someone not familiar with the famous comic series the show would be hard to follow but for those of us in the know it's a pleasure to watch br br first and foremost the animation is far superior to earlier comic adaptations you can tell they took the time and effort to really <UNK> the look and feel of the comics this time around br br as mentioned there are elements of other <UNK> titles in the movie and i can see how fans of those titles might feel confused or a bit let down but i was so caught up in actually seeing one of my favorite childhood comics <UNK> represented on the screen any <UNK> i had were minor by comparison minor spoilers follow br br <UNK> and his faithful friend travel north to rescue the nephew of their village chief who has been captured by the <UNK> the <UNK> think that by the boy teaching them about fear they will be able to fly thanks to some poorly <UNK> advice from their village <UNK> in the process the boy meets the <UNK> <UNK> daughter <UNK> and they fall in love etc etc etc if my explanation sounds convoluted don't worry the plot is easy to follow definitely a great buy you can purchase this dvd through amazon france but be warned your dvd player probably won't be able to play it i had to change the region setting on my computer to view it
<START> i knew the premise of this film and obviously i can't miss a good sounding film especially from master of suspense director sir alfred hitchcock basically <UNK> <UNK> guy haines <UNK> granger meets eccentric stranger bruno anthony robert walker on a train travelling from washington to new york bruno talks about a perfect murder guy hates his wife and bruno hates his father so bruno suggests <UNK> murders guy obviously didn't take him seriously until of course when guy's wife <UNK> <UNK> haines <UNK> rogers or laura elliott is found murdered in an amusement park guy of course is the chief suspect and bruno keeps <UNK> into him reminding him of their plan and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead this murder <UNK> and <UNK> stalking are threatening his <UNK> career and his relationship with the daughter of <UNK> <UNK> north by leo g <UNK> anne ruth roman bruno realises that guy won't do his murder so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty guy's cigarette lighter at the amusement park after his <UNK> game guy and anne who obviously found out the murder plan race to the amusement park to stop bruno and they have a fight on the <UNK> out of control <UNK> also starring patricia hitchcock the director's daughter as barbara <UNK> marion <UNK> as mrs anthony jonathan hale as mr anthony howard st john as police capt <UNK> and john brown as <UNK> collins and hitchcock's cameo is the man <UNK> train carrying a double bass some interesting dialogue and character interactions some good suspense moments and of course the unforgettable <UNK> finale a good classic film it was nominated the oscar for best cinematography sir alfred hitchcock was number 75 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons the film was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 thrills very good
<START> many people remember the <UNK> <UNK> that occurred a long time ago what most people probably have <UNK> in their minds is the cult leader david and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long <UNK> a lot of people have the belief that was some kind of madman who thought he was god he was accused of being a child <UNK> and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers furthermore many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the fbi <UNK> <UNK> center and when the building was burning most people feel the cult was at fault for not <UNK> with the fbi on reasonable terms most people feel the cult was <UNK> by and followed along with everything that he said nothing could be <UNK> from the truth because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over and this one of a kind documentary pretty much proves it br br this documentary is one of the most balanced <UNK> at the situation that occurred it is much more <UNK> and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media to the shock of many people this documentary will reveal that is was the the fbi and the higher levels of the united states government who were the ones who were <UNK> cruel and <UNK> and not david and his followers what and <UNK> were doing was just protecting their <UNK> rights and the higher powers completely <UNK> and raped those rights the <UNK> had no grounds to storm the compound it was the <UNK> that shot first and they shot from the <UNK> from above at <UNK> men women and children what is even more shocking is the actions of the fbi when they entered the <UNK> watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the u s government there is <UNK> footage that clearly shows the fbi was shooting with machine guns at the men women and children in the burning compound it will make your blood <UNK> it will make you really angry it will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country finally it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth this video is frightening and i highly recommend it if one can find it this documentary does not need to be purchased it can be watched for free on <UNK> video
<START> i always believed that a film that's plot is <UNK> around a virtual reality video game never sounds as though it's going to be anything special but proved i couldn't have been more wrong this film is unbelievable and whilst highly entertaining offers so much more than that from start to finish this film has you to the point where you can have so many ideas you can not make a final conclusion david <UNK> has a talent for this as he does so many things br br is pure <UNK> the way it's written and the way it's directed is very unique to his style and that can only be a good thing <UNK> set himself a clear target with this film and that was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease his <UNK> for the grotesque is not as <UNK> in this film as it is in the fly or naked lunch but there are still some elements such as the game <UNK> and how they are made that can make the audience <UNK> with regards to his earlier work is more a combination of <UNK> and a less violent <UNK> a pretty awesome combination setting the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed <UNK> to be extremely imaginative with the films surroundings and also <UNK> him to <UNK> more concepts allowing for less <UNK> writing it was important that the film didn't become over confusing and <UNK> avoided this very well by keeping things relatively simple besides if he wanted to make an unwatchable film he'd know how to do it a lot better than this br br boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and all perform very well jennifer jason leigh gives the standout performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in to it leigh is sexy and commanding in her role as and she really gets her teeth in to the role the emotional range she shows in the film is particularly impressive making her completely believable if you can believe anything jude law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of <UNK> the chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra bit of <UNK> ian <UNK> and willem dafoe are just two of the great actors in support who add further depth to the film with very colourful performances the cast of the film isn't huge but definitely has the <UNK> is better than <UNK> which works very well br br as well as being entertaining and thought provoking touches social issues such as control and loss of self this further demonstrates the film as an intellectual <UNK> and could also explain why it wasn't a huge hollywood hit has so much to offer and although it isn't to everyone's taste those who like <UNK> work or who like science fiction will almost be certain to like this film it is one of those films that needs to be watched with an open mind but it really is something special
<START> the <UNK> is a moody period piece the meandering story of a jewish woman who upon the death of her father sets out to <UNK> scotland posing as a <UNK> to get work to support her family in london br br <UNK> or mary as she calls herself in a none too subtle piece of symbolic writing is a <UNK> child a <UNK> with dreams of being an actress she strikes up an alliance with her <UNK> and by accident <UNK> a crucial problem in his research with photography <UNK> with success they begin a <UNK> and uncomfortable affair while the <UNK> son of her <UNK> falls hopelessly and inexplicably in love with her br br and like a child she fails to understand the consequences of her actions in the end <UNK> those she <UNK> in order to make a life for herself br br many claim this is something of a feminist <UNK> but i disagree whether intended or not this film only <UNK> with me if i think of it as a <UNK> tale in the end greatest disappointment is the truth that she <UNK> happened upon a way to help a man she wanted to be both her father and her lover and in the end contributed nothing but destruction as such the end of the film gives me the impression that nothing she did no one she used made her happy and that is exactly as it should be br br did i need a movie this long and to teach me this lesson not at all on the contrary had it not been for excellent cinematography unique score and my hope that she'd get her come <UNK> i wouldn't have stuck with it to the end of the film br br fans of <UNK> driver will likely be disappointed by her uneven performance but may wish to see it anyway i doubt young female fans of jonathan rhys meyers will be able to stay awake for the payoff they expect and i can't help thinking this holds too little cultural detail to be of interest even to photography buffs the 3 points i award the film are solely for its visual style and score on the strength of their other work i assume the actors' performances are so disappointing because of a poor script and worse directing but they are in the end <UNK>
<START> catch that girl is really great movie it's a <UNK> movie i watched this movie in international fantastic film festival ' on july 2003 there is action adventure comedy thrill happy romance cute kids' love triangle you must see this movie
<START> i don't care what some of the reviews said this movie was funny the thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained this is not some intellectual comedy this is a clever popcorn movie the three main cast members are great and work very well with each other shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself a former tv cop brought in by <UNK> character to coach the cops on how to be tv cops those are by far the funniest scenes if you want to be entertained and just sit back for a laugh then watch this movie
<START> i work at a nuclear power plant so i am getting a kick out of these replies br br seriously i do go to http en <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nuclear <UNK> station and you can see where i work br br i could not think of a <UNK> industry to work in we are required by <UNK> to report events as minor as paper cuts any issue identified as being a potential concern with respect to nuclear or industrial safety is immediately reported in the action process br br bottom line is that nuclear plants in the us operate with safety in the front of their mind
<START> superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to mary <UNK> period novel this film is a true masterpiece aside from the exceptionally talented rising star janet <UNK> as the lead and one or two established actors the film used mostly little known names yet the drama was all the more convincing for that the social and personal tension is almost <UNK> and i felt as if the cast were <UNK> each other's character as though they would have done in real life i saw that one <UNK> asked if janet <UNK> really had a <UNK> lip a <UNK> to just how good was her characterisation i saw this on tv when it was first shown taped it then later the tape was sadly lost but it remains clear as anything in my mind if you have any <UNK> at all for the social period it's an absolute must see
<START> i have to confess i fell into the cynical trap of believing that <UNK> couldn't make drama unless it meant a lot of crying and i am an australian sad isn't it while this movie does involve crying its not dramatic crying its honest emotion shining through br br also this film is a <UNK> i knew what the final outcome was going to be when i started watching this so i tried to guess who it was that was going to do it i missed by a mile br br i was stunned when i found out the director was only around 21 when he made this film i would love to shake his hand he knows how to make a movie i hope he has more coming br br all of the characters we meet before the main title credit about 12 minutes in is an anti hero all of them troubled in their own way and all of them as selfish as the next one even when they are sympathetic br br the saddest scene in the movie and there are some that are difficult to watch is the final scene where we're <UNK> introduced to the real main character and we're told of their nephew that scene made me cry br br my faith in australian drama has been restored we're masters at comedy but i was getting bored with comedy br br if you happen to check this out you touched my soul and for that i can only thank you
<START> i saw this series in 1999 in london tv and was blown away like another user commented this is what i would have liked to see when i first watched jurassic park life and death of dinosaurs in their natural <UNK> as a documentary the cg are very <UNK> and the diversity of dinosaurs and <UNK> shown makes it also very educational br br the series takes everything <UNK> known about dinosaurs adds a lot of good ideas on what it could have been to make up what then looks like a documentary series what i missed was some small bar <UNK> constantly in one corner of the screen moving between fiction and fact along with the narration and the pictures because you often wonder how much is educated guessing and how much is pure fantasy br br to some clues on facts fiction you have to see the 50 minute making of which is not only very educational about the cg process and collecting and including the <UNK> knowledge into the series but which also is very funny dinosaurs smoking <UNK> and complaining about cg animators br br i highly recommend to watch this series before going into the upcoming disney dinosaur movie or watching any jurassic park like movie again it will surely make you much more critical towards those movies the disney trailers looked especially bad
<START> easily one of the best shows ever made it just gets better with age br br for me one of the chief reasons for this was the english adaptation done by david <UNK> br br a japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in it's original language was more whimsical less flat out hilarious that the version we all know br br the fact that the show <UNK> so strongly for its non japanese fans is i think largely because of mr <UNK> inspired efforts some winning voice over work br br well done sir
<START> what a shame that some good talent was wasted this is a tedious and overly self conscious movie that could tell its story in half the time is that derek <UNK> under that beard doing two roles gosh who would have guessed br br the emotional payoff a the end was weak and unsatisfying certainly not worth enduring the padded length of the movie for i felt quite let down br br the sound was dreadful first they used stock music second it was so loud during some of the dialog that the words were hard to make out only three sound crew and a <UNK> there were more people listed in the credits for either the <UNK> or the legal br br some of the camera work was quite good though and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script br br not a good use of viewing time at least for me
<START> drab dreary and a total waste of my time the plot is incomprehensible so don't think about it too much the acting is odd and wooden i would have <UNK> that they were all professional body <UNK> trying their luck at acting but that might be an insult to body <UNK> there are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster but lots of fires explosions a gratuitous sex scene etc the only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the us and iraq that somehow goes nuclear hmmm is roger corman psychic let's hope that iraq was just a lucky choice for corman and that the rest of his scenario doesn't come true br br
<START> so you're a giant <UNK> and you've been hanging out in the <UNK> for a while and you're tired of <UNK> hitting you with <UNK> what's a giant mutant <UNK> to do head for the big city of course see the sights maybe catch a show on broadway but wait just when you find a nice <UNK> tunnel to call your own some <UNK> humans start attacking you <UNK> time to smash br br anyhow this movie is one step up on most other giant bug movies because it has pretty decent fx for 1957 but that's about it avoid unless you really need to see another big bug smash things or see another perry mason actor in a b movie br br 4 10

<START> what do you mean son of actor not an actor you don't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar it doesn't work that way not in uk at any rate br br <UNK> this version is a low budget scottish movie you can't compare this to the polanski version because polanski has all the budgets in the world br br jason acted throughout school but his big break came in 1985 when he landed the role of robin hood in <UNK> robin of <UNK> television series he has appeared in many films since then including shanghai <UNK> and lord of the rings jason has since moved behind the camera <UNK> the production company <UNK> entertainment he recently wrapped filming on his latest movie which stars cuba gooding jr and ray <UNK> br br and all this has nothing to do with being the son of sean connery if you think jason said to sean daddy i wanna be in <UNK> movie that they are going to film and sean said sure son whatever you say and made a phone call and got his son the role you are mistaken in fact jason connery is being cut out of his father's will seeing as how his father is sean connery that's a big <UNK> of change jason will be losing out on the reasoning behind the decision is apparently <UNK> strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself the relationship has become fairly strained with jason even threatening to change his name br br of being the son of sean connery br br i realize that i'm always going to be compared to my father there are <UNK> all the time should i spend my whole life <UNK> myself br br so stop being a jackass and <UNK> him of not being able to act just because he is son of sean connery big deal br br watch jason in bullet to <UNK> and you'll form a different opinion about his acting ability
<START> at the 2005 phoenix film festival it was no secret which film <UNK> at the top of everyone's viewing list checking out 2004 brought crowds of film lovers to <UNK> <UNK> festival <UNK> who waited in line for hours were turned away at the door despite the two theater screening capacity br br checking out 2004 is a beautifully made moving picture an inspiring comedy for a wide range of audiences to enjoy the director jeff <UNK> <UNK> traditional film technique with a new twist of creativity capturing peter falk at his greatest and most sentimental moments usually shown in intimate close up shots on the silver screen br br with its uplifting mix of witty humor and narrative plot development checking out 2004 is a landmark independent film well deserving of your attention
<START> an interesting pairing of stories this little flick manages to bring together seemingly different characters and story lines all in the backdrop of wwii and succeeds in <UNK> them together without losing the audience i was impressed by the depth portrayed by the different characters and also by how much i really felt i understood them and their motivations even though the time spent on the development of each character was very limited the outstanding acting abilities of the individuals involved with this picture are easily noted a fun stylized movie with a slew of comic moments and a bunch more head shaking events br br 7 10
<START> for a moment let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie even if it is a very important side of it and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope if each one of these two women had been alone imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept they found each other and they fell in love that this love was against all the social religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant they loved each other found relief in each other that was sufficient the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept suffer even and then they can go on with their lives their life very nice
<START> douglas <UNK> <UNK> women's picture <UNK> for universal based on a preachy <UNK> <UNK> novel by the <UNK> lloyd c douglas author of that other beloved piece of crap the <UNK> rock hudson in the role that <UNK> him to stardom plays bob a drunken playboy worth <UNK> millions who is more interested in chasing <UNK> and racing than in finishing his medical degree in the first scene he <UNK> his boat on a <UNK> photographed lake the accident nearly kills and thus he requires a rather mysterious machine to keep him alive meanwhile across town beloved surgeon dr phillips finally drops dead from a heart condition since the local hospital can maintain only one at a time phillips dies so that the <UNK> may live when learns of this he tries to make <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> family especially to the widow jane <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> but indeed anyone and everyone who knew the surgeon <UNK> at like a <UNK> of <UNK> one doctor on the hospital staff even calls it a total waste that the playboy lived instead of the christ like surgeon might have had something to say about that br br these early scenes are where you'll find the typical the director <UNK> our faces so much in the <UNK> of middle class mid century america that one finds <UNK> rooting for the <UNK> playboy to put <UNK> <UNK> under the of these moral <UNK> but alas no the <UNK> plot of the novel must proceed and soon finds himself getting converted by god in the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> otto <UNK> an artist who claims that phillips made him a better man and even a better painter why don't we see any of this amazing art we learn that the <UNK> <UNK> dr phillips would often refuse <UNK> for medical services rendered though who exactly <UNK> for these magnificent is never made clear this is supposed to provide our hero with a whole new <UNK> on life and an example of personal conduct <UNK> even tries to make it all sound very <UNK> exciting once you start this thing there's no way out of it it's an obsession a magnificent obsession so tries it out by again the widow with <UNK> <UNK> but he somehow causes her to get hit by a car she loses her <UNK> apparently will have several more stations of the cross to <UNK> past before he can be <UNK> a decent fellow br br but sirk continues to sneak in his even as the movie grows more and more preachy the most obvious bit has to be the presence of <UNK> <UNK> as the head hospital nurse and friend and <UNK> lesbian lover note the disappointment on face when finally redeemed as a doctor shows up to save life near the end <UNK> own homosexuality an open secret in hollywood at the time is also used to great ironic effect he and <UNK> <UNK> and fifteen years older generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes together which by the way are <UNK> few presumably because any more scenes between the stars would hopelessly expose this whole enterprise one thing we feel certain of if rock hudson was obsessed by anything it certainly wasn't jane <UNK> it's a <UNK> case of tea and sympathy sirk seemed to enjoy <UNK> everyone's <UNK> by having this gay actor who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the era <UNK> drift through these <UNK> colored women's pictures in fact the director worked with hudson 6 or 7 more times to best effect in the follow up to this film all that heaven allows which re teamed hudson with <UNK> but was also accompanied by a realistic plot in obsession meanwhile we must endure god <UNK> <UNK> down from an observation window onto and his medical team as they prepare to save life in <UNK> with a musical score of <UNK> <UNK> from a cheesy hollywood choir br br but to see why sirk is considered an auteur check out the scene <UNK> <UNK> explains to her grown daughter that she can in fact tell the difference from night and day the entire frame is <UNK> here the daughter is barely visible and face is <UNK> <UNK> against a faint light she goes on to say that she hates the night because i know that dawn will never come again a great chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than magnificent obsession br br 4 stars out of 10
<START> sam elliot is brilliant as a tough san francisco detective charlie fallon when his partner is killed while meeting with an <UNK> fallon <UNK> beats the <UNK> to death and <UNK> his body in a river the next day fallon is assigned a rookie partner and given the task of investigating the <UNK> murder sam elliot does a good job of portraying a man who tortured by the guilt of his own murderous actions and grief over the death of his partner who may have been involved in police corruption
<START> <UNK> death in <UNK> qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made while watching we acknowledge we are in the hands of a <UNK> genius endlessly <UNK> death in <UNK> surely is but in other important ways it's an unsatisfying film thomas mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von literary career and <UNK> of his <UNK> manner his <UNK> upon <UNK> of <UNK> self conscious behavior when appears and obsession <UNK> it's evident that hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his <UNK> age <UNK> and carefully lived life in fact upon seeing the ' as mann sometimes calls him <UNK> in two no 1 <UNK> the sight of a beautiful 14 year old boy then attempts to intellectually process the <UNK> <UNK> in blood pressure as he would a work of art a work of art but no 2 emerges as a stalker who takes control of then <UNK> the rational no 1 like the original his sexual <UNK> is <UNK> to make human contact with the object of his obsession and thus remains a far off ideal thomas mann has no mercy for this game every shred of self knowledge comes too strong and too late the excitement of sexual <UNK> is too great to resist that <UNK> is <UNK> by disease means nothing to except that his game now has higher stakes when he finally <UNK> beneath his breath 'i love you ' he knows that all is lost and the <UNK> <UNK> is any of this <UNK> perhaps and visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from but there are errors he and <UNK> <UNK> create as sympathetic mann again did not <UNK> <UNK> the film and we are expected to identify but nowhere on screen is there a man being torn apart from within <UNK> between the <UNK> controlled and the ridiculously <UNK> with ease but what's underneath <UNK> performance has no mann writes a character who is in his imagination doing the dance of the seven <UNK> all too aware of the consequences such freedom invites yet unable unwilling to resist also <UNK> screenplay creates a character not in the original alfred a friend of to <UNK> <UNK> discussion of art and artists these scenes are badly written disasters and the actor who portrays alfred is difficult to watch also <UNK> is a <UNK> age <UNK> composer which i think works for the film and the <UNK> of substitute for novels great music unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly played so death in <UNK> as visconti hands it to us is not the complete success it might have been but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied all students of film especially cinematography will want to take a look
<START> it is characteristic that this film is not better known it obviously lacks most elements that a successful theater film needs heroes villains conflict and resolution romantic love interest br br everything is <UNK> <UNK> here nothing works out as it should everyone is clumsy sad angry hurt and hungry and nobody has a solution for anything in short it is war and it is hell for everybody involved people try to do best but interests <UNK> and so called duty <UNK> the picture <UNK> us back in time to the civil war with an intensity seldom seen in today's cinema straightforward honest images of an intense beauty the actors are very well cast for the story and they make the characters come truly alive in front of our eyes br br a silver dollar in a heap of <UNK>
<START> hard to believe that director <UNK> <UNK> once did the <UNK> and very funny <UNK> 1976 and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillers br br this is very lightweight john <UNK> material crossed with the plot of a tv movie <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and independent crime investigator <UNK> in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two <UNK> college <UNK> <UNK> and pitt decide to send them on a wild <UNK> chase by <UNK> very clever and misleading <UNK> evidence at a crime scene br br fair enough but while <UNK> and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks <UNK> an important event in <UNK> history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side <UNK> cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the <UNK> ending will be set <UNK> the atmosphere br br watch any episode of <UNK> instead it's to the point and far more exciting
<START> alexander <UNK> is rightfully held up as a cinematic masterpiece it has however aged very badly people decide not to mention this and talk about the great battles and the great music the sound effects may have been good then but apart from the foreboding <UNK> all the sounds are <UNK> i may be shot by film buffs for this but i'm sure the modern viewer of alexander <UNK> will agree that the blatant propaganda and the appalling music to detract from the film i gave this film 10 10 because it is undeniably a master piece it does have its great bits however the costumes of the <UNK> knights are superb and the battle scenes are fairly good for the time it is however a master piece that is showing it's age
<START> i haven't seen this funny of a show on fox in a long time and the wait was worth it the kids in the show have something that i can relate to on every episode and even my dad will sit down and watch it it is a show not for all ages that doesn't dumb down for kids it is like still standing but to the next level the stuff that everyone says is stuff that everyone says and actions that everyone does it says stuff that we all think but in a well rounded way of presentation the first time i saw the show i could not believe that it was on fox and that it was allowed to stay on the air after a few episodes from <UNK> boyfriend choices to <UNK> boyfriend choices it is well worth the watch
<START> i watched this show until my <UNK> but still i found it to <UNK> many situations that worry us when we're teenagers although it was a family oriented show until the mid 90's it focused more on the young adults and their situations br br that's why i loved step by step i mean it offered situations for every age and unlike many shows of it's kind it delivered expectations br br let's be honest this wasn't an extremely funny show no but it had some situations that you could feel related to but only funnier br br there was an extremely good charm between patrick <UNK> and susan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was tender and actually funny i was in love with <UNK> because she was extremely sexy loved her legs and witty but <UNK> mitchell stole the show with his cody character he was the man back in the day oh the memories nowadays this show wasn't been able to adequate correctly on the new generations and that's why it should be kept in the vault of memories that's it only memories br br thank you step by step for making my <UNK> funnier
<START> i could almost wish this movie had not been made stan laurel was dying and it shows in his face even more <UNK> and <UNK> than usual a poor script and inept supporting cast
<START> 1960's kid show with ex <UNK> playing handy men for hire as you can expect they are a disaster at everything they do over the course of the 11 minute episodes leaving 4 minutes for commercials in the 15 minute time <UNK> they do things like set up a fence between <UNK> neighbors help a magician on stage and deal with a found <UNK> and <UNK> br br growing up i had never run across this show which appears to have been shot in new york i thought i had run heard of or seen a most of the children's shows from the period either through having watched them as a kid or viewed them at nostalgia conventions until <UNK> video released it on dvd i had been completely unaware if its existence br br the show plays like the three stooges mixed with <UNK> and <UNK> as done by people <UNK> the routines indeed one of the pair claims to have created the legendary slowly i turned routine that <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> its not bad but its really not good either since everything seems watered down the timing is often off though that maybe due to bad direction and the jokes were recycled years before the show first ran odds are you've seen it all before on the plus side its the type of thing that would be perfect to introduce very young kids to the magic of vaudeville style comedy however its going to be trying for parents to sit through even with the short episodes br br for nostalgia <UNK> only everyone else should look to seeing an <UNK> and <UNK> or three stooges original
<START> i first saw this movie back in the early 90's and instantly fell in love with it richard benjamin and his wife paula made the 1981 movie saturday the <UNK> in 1981 prior to making this movie in 1983 i think they work quite well together this movie made me laugh on several occasions it also has a young molly <UNK> who would later go on in the late 1980's to do movies such as pretty in pink and sixteen <UNK> it is fun watching her a little younger although not seen by many people i don't even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie but when i first came it i was glad i did i gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as i think it is a fun movie the whole family can enjoy lastly i would like to say its not available on dvd so i picked up a vhs copy on ebay so if your interested you probably can find one on there it might be in the 20 30 dollar range but i got mind for 12 bucks i wish they would eventually release this on dvd
<START> as a big fan of brian <UNK> and the majority of the movies he's been involved in i guessed i'd enjoy <UNK> i didn't although in ways it has it's moments however if you're expecting something of the <UNK> of society or beyond <UNK> you could be in for a shock in a way this is similar to society being a tale of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrific supernatural <UNK> but that's where it ends br br i'm not covering for <UNK> when i say that the fault doesn't really lie with him as bad direction is bad direction but the direction is sound what <UNK> the movie up is both script and acting stuart gordon <UNK> <UNK> has written an intelligent script but one that doesn't really work with <UNK> style of direction leaving him <UNK> on actors delivering lengthy dialogue when really he wants to throw that camera around and get down with his bad self this matter makes the movie awkward enough as it is but there's worse br br if the movie had been made with great actors the movie would have probably held it's own unfortunately this is very far from the case the acting is wooden shockingly so even for a low budget b feature the inexplicably successful and renowned arnold <UNK> <UNK> every damn line with near <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in one of the worst performances i've seen in a long while the man manages to turn every line of well considered dialogue into the kind of ham line you'll be throwing <UNK> at mates next time you're in the pub <UNK> bob good god am i going mad what's come over me <UNK> ' in fact i may try that one myself next weekend the last minute addition of genre veteran and personal favourite brad <UNK> instead of <UNK> the film like it should almost seems to hand <UNK> the movie in a last <UNK> effort to stop <UNK> from <UNK> but quite frankly <UNK> looks deeply uncomfortable possibly waiting for the next assault of bad acting next to <UNK> and even an eccentric turn from him fails to <UNK> the film br br if the acting was better this movie would have been okay hell it might have been pretty enjoyable but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair and makes the horror element seem tacked on and tasteless instead of an <UNK> part of the film i found the alien torture rape scenes a little difficult to stomach already but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them seem gratuitous as well as unpleasant leaving a nasty taste in the mouth br br so if you really like sci fi and don't have a problem with bad acting pedestrian pacing and a really <UNK> nasty rape scene <UNK> will probably be your cup of tea but since i do i'm probably never going to watch it again once was enough on the plus side this is the only sci fi movie <UNK> ever bothered to make so he obviously wasn't really that pleased with it himself
<START> i've just seen this movie and it made me cry it's a beautiful drama about two brothers falling in love and i think it's a good idea especially for the closed minded to watch this one i have come to love the short film genre after just having seen a couple because they have to make an impression on you so fast and i have to say that this one definitely sat it's mark it described some things that i haven't ever really thought about that way incest for one br br i have to admit that i did not care too much for the ending just once i would like to watch a gay themed movie without wanting to kill myself after <UNK> they seem to pretty much always end in tragedy it was <UNK> though how that they had to be together even if it was in death br br i gave it eight stars and i recommend it too everyone cause i think it gives an <UNK> <UNK> in the world that this movie make you enter br br thanks for listening enjoy
<START> i watch the show every day and it is very entertaining it provides <UNK> of tech news video games pretty much everything geek they are also the official <UNK> of and <UNK> if you are a geek <UNK> or anything really you will enjoy this show they have definitely <UNK> their game since the guy below <UNK> review 2006 it's the only place that i get my tech info kevin <UNK> and olivia <UNK> work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game movie comic universe if you know those <UNK> you will understand the jokes long story short is a hilarious show that gives me and anyone all the news about anything and everything that you care about i'm watching it right now as i type this they are <UNK> san diego covering the red bull air races sweet
<START> gere diane lane back again in another romantic love story they are an excellent team but somehow this film will not be among there best br br the director george <UNK> using a screenplay by ann <UNK> john for nicholas sparks novel does a capable job this is yet another tale of 2 strangers meeting falling in love then they go on there way then when they are about to meet again start a life together br br spoiler but not really tragedy happens one of them dies br br how many times have we seen this already br br those who never saw <UNK> like this will hopefully like it more than i did this story has about every cliché there is br br the only reason this has the ratings i will give it is because of the fine acting excellent production the cast besides our 2 stars includes christopher <UNK> <UNK> davis scott glenn they all give real good performances do the very best with the material they were given br br there is a good but not over done storm sequence the sex scenes are well done no nudity next to no foul language br br ratings out of 4 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10
<START> not one of better not trying to be amusing here either chan entries the shanghai <UNK> has a lot going for it but in the end is just way too confusing and <UNK> to be overly satisfying the film opens with a murderer named the shanghai <UNK> having already struck twice and now is about in a scene at a diner in some way we have a guy a girl and another guy having some implied connection when one guy dies in the streets yes i am <UNK> things here for the sake of <UNK> for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation i haven't even gone into the diner cook who has some involvement and a <UNK> box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to have a problem with that all this is in the first five minutes or so then chan enters film working for the government and flying out to help a friend he also has right to check a <UNK> store of <UNK> and is looking for a man wrapped in <UNK> that he helped arrest in shanghai many years earlier i found the plot very involved as stated earlier <UNK> is back as chan he is ever <UNK> benson <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are back too both do good jobs and are quite amusing but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance this isn't a bad movie not just a very interesting one except for the most devoted of chan fans
<START> the <UNK> is set in <UNK> where some sort of ex cia government agent named griffith wesley snipes has <UNK> down a arms dealer named matthew <UNK> things go wrong though finds out that is working for the us government after a big shoot out most of men have been killed by which the local romanian police force are unhappy about top man <UNK> michael brandon decides to send back to the us at the same time protect a woman named <UNK> <UNK> who is also being sent back to the us however it turns out that <UNK> is wanted by his football club <UNK> boss tim <UNK> who need her in order to complete a deal for a nerve gas bomb which they intend to set off in washington killing millions of people br br this american romanian co production was directed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> beyond any shadow of a doubt that snipes has joined the washed up action film stars club who are <UNK> to making generic action films in eastern european locations yep snipes has joined such <UNK> as jean claude van damme steven seagal dolph lundgren <UNK> <UNK> chuck norris i give snipes a bit of credit since he held on a little longer than the rest with the excellent blade <UNK> 2004 still fresh in a lot of cinema goers minds every film he has made since has gone straight to dvd but it had to happen sooner or later like a lot of the names i've mentioned snipes has lived off the reputation of a few great films if you look at his career he's been in more bad films that good ones like the recent films of seagal the <UNK> is pretty awful the script by martin <UNK> is as predictable boring by the numbers as anything out there the <UNK> is the sort of film you expect to see on an obscure cable tv channel playing at 2 <UNK> in the morning the <UNK> is chock full of clichés snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman at first they dislike each other but by the end they are in love his closest friend at the cia turns out to be a <UNK> while the obnoxious by the book boss no one likes actually turns out to be a pretty decent guy snipes character is allowed to run around <UNK> shooting killing blowing people up like it doesn't matter he never gets arrested the action is dull forgettable the bad guy own a football club so there are lots of annoying football <UNK> there aren't even any funny one liners br br director <UNK> doesn't do anything anything to <UNK> things up the <UNK> looks cheap with a car chase in which the two cars never seem to get over the mark ok the action scenes are relatively well staged but they are few far between utterly forgettable in a <UNK> guy shoots at snipes misses in return snipes shoots at bad guy kills <UNK> sort of way there's a half decent car crash explosion but very little else it seems some of the <UNK> was shot in a romanian football stadium i think i'd rather have watched the game for 90 minutes rather than this film br br with a supposed budget of about 15 000 000 the <UNK> is reasonably well made but not that much really happens set filmed in <UNK> in romania the acting isn't that great snipes just doesn't seem interested feels like he is just there for the money which i don't blame him for at all br br the <UNK> is yet another poor clichéd action film starring a has been actor set in eastern europe why do <UNK> keep making these things not recommend there are much better action fare out there
<START> target is the story of a special agent who after carrying out orders to <UNK> turkish terrorists note that this is one of those american movies for guys who love mindless <UNK> super patriotic crap movies returns home to find that his ex wife and two kids are taking hostage charlie snow has just a couple of hours to do whatever the terrorists tell him in order to get them back br br this was by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen and had it not been for someone i know actually and probably <UNK> taking it out of the video store i would never have watched this giant pile of garbage to begin with br br the movie plays out like any generic action movie story i have ever seen before in fact these are the kind of things they spoof on variety shows that is how bad it is i half expected in living the <UNK> the to mad tv's will doing his steven segal impression to bust out on the screen half way through to remind you that this was just an exaggerated action movie but now our characters are here to spoof how ridiculous it really is there were not even any good fighting or action sequences by the way things are played out you wouldn't even think that anyone was kidnapped that there were any terrorists or that anything remotely interesting was going on br br not only is the story completely and utterly uninteresting the acting is so terribly wooden just watch the part where stephen baldwin as former special agent charlie snow is talking to the <UNK> on the <UNK> they tell him that they have his wife and they put her on the phone she says charlie help or something to that effect and baldwin replies it's okay honey in such a deadpan manner you think he was reading the script and trying to sound out the words <UNK> i imagine that despite being such a ridiculously bad movie one that belongs on the bottom 100 on imdb a list that they should expand to at least 250 movies and should contain nearly every stephen baldwin movie someone with some talent could have at least made the effort not to ham it up as much someone anyone i couldn't get past the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script save that is the only person in the whole <UNK> movie who has any talent whatsoever and thus should not have been in this mad tv's deborah wilson br br this was the capital cheese fest how truly embarrassing
<START> if it wasn't for the terrific music i would not hesitate to give this cinematic 2 10 but the music actually makes me like certain <UNK> and so i give it 5 10
<START> the best scene of the people across the lake is the genuinely creepy <UNK> opening scene featuring a house a murder a lake after that it's pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned a family mom dad sister younger brother is fed up with the mildly dangerous environment of <UNK> and decides to go and live near the titular lake from then on the film features too much lame happy family related doo doo near the lake with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there the couple of scenes where they discover the bodies are pretty convincing in terms of creepiness but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings on featuring just every day life stuff of the family <UNK> in the truth to the matters the mystery as to who's doing the killing is learned too soon leaving only the family <UNK> and the viewer <UNK> during the <UNK> finale featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house like if this made for tv thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film it's not really badly made the content story is just not interesting enough the only highlight in the cast is barry corbin though his performance character is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious blond <UNK> <UNK> lauren the daughter might be a <UNK> face for avid horror <UNK> too as she also starred in <UNK> 1997 and made for tv <UNK> like i saw what you did 1988 the <UNK> children 1987 she hasn't got much to do in this film though but watchable if anything
<START> this is not a story it's a bunch of psychic <UNK> reaching for your <UNK> if you wait for a story you'll be bored but if you give yourself over to it you'll be inside it's <UNK> within 10 minutes the vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape leave room for your own fantasies the strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation the visual echoes of the <UNK> of christ the <UNK> light and deep dark shadows they all reach to your <UNK> to fill in this mind space i found myself <UNK> and unable to escape in front of my television it was like dreaming with eyes wide open a strange nightmare a bad trip a religious experience it touched me deep inside and marked me for live it freed my mind and gave me one of that rare experiences of loss of personality and <UNK> with the world of <UNK> a little freedom for the soul a violent freedom however not a nice movie but a very strong and unforgettable one literally my text has no spoilers for me the great surprise of this film was the unbelievable intensity of it and describing this can be understood as a spoiler the less you know about this film as you watch it the better
<START> i was expecting a documentary covering the 1950 to 1965 era of sci fi and received a big ol' commercial laced with <UNK> political innuendo by james cameron and movie <UNK> baby pushing the own works <UNK> the has in the past referred to the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> movies from the 1950's including such favorites as earth vs the flying <UNK> thing from another world and forbidden planet as well as them deadly <UNK> and <UNK> there are lower budget examples that rarely get mentioned like space monster 12 to the moon and <UNK> man br br this would have been a much better documentary had the few remaining actors directors stunt men and <UNK> plus the non hollywood from the era been interviewed i only wish there was a 0 rating available since a 1 is much to generous
<START> well they've done it again a new <UNK> head film the first <UNK> head film was perfect for its time a dumb gory and clichéd monster flick so <UNK> how it goes some one loses their loved one goes to the witch in the woods gets her to raise <UNK> head and have it murder everyone responsible unfortunately the film makers have deemed it irrelevant to try and do any other than this for the films fourth outing it far more suitable to add some lame romeo and juliet sub plot involving an idiotic family <UNK> over a car and surprise surprise some gory <UNK> head <UNK> so far so formulaic but it doesn't stop there the acting talent in this flick is dire oh so bad half of them can't even keep up a southern accent without <UNK> into their native and often <UNK> accents lance is on board so surely he would bring some <UNK> to the movies proceedings but no lance merely <UNK> on screen lets the words fall out mouth with absolutely no emotion or seemingly direction and walks off again i honestly think he just turned up for the money then went off to his trailer to drunk and <UNK> about aliens br br this film is utter <UNK> there is no redeeming feature other than it ending credits which <UNK> its all over br br despite the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> if you want a no <UNK> that'll make you laugh for all the wrong reasons watch it br br if you want something with more meat and originality avoid
<START> kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times he may have made more classics than anyone else he may have been a <UNK> but man was his first attempt ever bad br br kubrick had good reason to try to make this film from the map it looks like an ed wood film it has strange narration cheap shots bad dialogue ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci fi horror flick and what looks like relatives of the cast of <UNK> madness going insane for no reason br br sure you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there it is a psychological horror study of war the characters became <UNK> and insane there are people playing more than one role there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people and there are a few interesting shots around there but really this is a mess br br of course i am not <UNK> you from watching it if you get a hold of it you are joining a <UNK> group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it

<START> because they all just watch there mst3k with their artificial friends who make mostly not that funny and obvious comments about movies and that's the only way these people watch them and then they comment and down vote them on the imdb based just on that they don't even try to watch the film on it's own br br i watched this film on it's own i didn't read the reviews first i didn't have some people telling what to laugh at i just got the dvd bought for the flip side morons from outer space an old <UNK> and watched it br br of cause i knew kind of what i was in for when it's a <UNK> <UNK> albert <UNK> film but usually they can be quite entertaining br br the film is a non too <UNK> on the brain alice down the rabbit hole story done so many times and kind of similar in basic structure but completely different in content to <UNK> of atlantis another entertaining b movie br br the voice was annoying but then that's the idea which they even poke at with a few lines in the movie br br the hero character had one of the worst over the top voices accents in english language film history but you grow to accept it and enjoy it br br it's not a good film but it's not a really bad film it's just a bit of an average b movie <UNK> kind of film nothing too new nothing too outstanding and probably would be enjoyed more by a younger age <UNK> say 7 14 year olds than i it's a bit of light hearted fantasy br br will i see it again probably not maybe about 10 years ago i would have br br don't be so harsh on a movie because a couple of puppets told you too this film isn't taking itself seriously and it's certainly no <UNK> 2 or space <UNK>
<START> this movie was really stupid and i thought that it wasn't so bad and i could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people then the part near the end where the guy has <UNK> hands ended up being the <UNK> on top of a bad movie i could see the <UNK> in the plastic <UNK> hands for goodness <UNK> the brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones the funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right without <UNK> you really can't move your hands but he did the brother should have <UNK> to death even before he was moving his hands the movie wasn't great but it was okay until the hand scene i was laughing so hard that i don't really remember how it ended it had something to do with <UNK> or something

<START> every time i watch this movie blood comes <UNK> out of my eyes yes you read that correctly i've watched this wretched foul thing more than once br br <UNK> 2 went wrong for so many reasons harold <UNK> <UNK> in a script and <UNK> the direction duties rodney <UNK> wisely walking away from the project because they wouldn't allow him to <UNK> with the script bill murray showing excellent judgement and not being part of it and a puppet being pushed forward as the feature player of a cast who deserved much better br br i can't help but think of <UNK> cannon in this and wonder why she's <UNK> laughing and smiling the only conclusion i can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil stay with me a moment she must have been watching as the film came together and <UNK> in the <UNK> agony that it would <UNK> on countless soon to be extremely sorry movie goers who would have this film inflicted on them she may also have been extremely drunk that's what i need to be right now to wash the foul taste of this complete and utter failure out of my mind if i'm lucky it'll be washed out forever br br i have seen this film several times i blame several of them on childhood and being a very dull and dim witted boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility perhaps puppets are just funnier when you're a kid no the muppet show is funnier now guess i was just dull <UNK> 2 is that rare kind of film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the end credits that it couldn't have been as bad as all that it was it is it will only get worse with time br br my reasons for going back to this film mercifully are becoming fewer randy quaid is limited in his role as jackie <UNK> lawyer his opening scene isn't bad and brought out my only chuckle we see him a few more times but it becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and <UNK> with unfortunate <UNK> from incidentally amusing to vapid <UNK> randy quaid <UNK> himself well and this film owes him big time because if there was reason to watch this film as anything other than a torture <UNK> he was it br br maybe that's the trick of the movie it has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it are horrified at what they've done to themselves but later because the <UNK> were so slim can remember only what did actually <UNK> them years later they <UNK> watch it again and the cycle repeats br br jackie mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness i'm not sure he deserves it he's really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a rodney <UNK> <UNK> that's who the movie was written for but i'm not sure even he could have saved it ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction bad editing shall we count continuity errors and a <UNK> of the same story with none of the <UNK> humour or heart that made the first film endearing br br dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by randy <UNK> <UNK> determination it isn't even bad enough to laugh at i've definitely seen worse but trust your memory this one is a dog if you've never seen it you've made excellent life choices and i <UNK> your excellent judgement

<START> this is what james cagney is all about <UNK> <UNK> hard as nails and no nonsense charisma br br although the plot sounds serious the film is anything but it is done in the 30's screwball comedy style and works well with his with fiancé mae clark and his reactions to the tall stories of his colleague james burke br br what raises it above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it dialogue is good but it is nothing unless delivery is spot on and can <UNK> about the characters involved this is done well by all throughout br br good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable

circumstances that brought about the change of orders putting <UNK> in charge of the detail the black white photography enhances the dire nature of this western only the <UNK> amounts to a last stand western until the last minute <UNK> reportedly peck hated this movie but then this is not a spit and polish western in technicolor if anything only the <UNK> lives up to its warner brothers origins it is small but significant and it is <UNK> with loads of drama and <UNK> characters virtually a dirty dozen western
<START> this has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies charles band made the best movie of in this little seen gem highly realistic and incredibly <UNK> with a visual flair david <UNK> would envy its not hard to see why band went on to make such classics as 2 deliverance from <UNK> 'the <UNK> pierce <UNK> of <UNK> and tales of the <UNK> br br with a highly sophisticated story a tiny body with a large head controls a family of <UNK> who perform experiments on naked women this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer but for those who see it band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece the head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one's inner self that we all must face at one point or another and for this reason i was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level although many earlier critics have compared <UNK> film to re animator and other lesser works this stands head and heels above the rest it is <UNK> but not <UNK> the gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline rather than to just get a cheap <UNK> out of the audience also the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch easily the best work done in a horror film since well ever the work in this film makes <UNK> effects look like the work of a blind <UNK> <UNK> br br the only problem i have with this film is the <UNK> amounts of full frontal nudity which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the <UNK> goal to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time if it were not for this slight problem i would have given this film a perfect 10

<START> i was a <UNK> while in the u s a f and remember this movie very well we had just been set up with <UNK> sound o o o o o well it was a big deal in 1959 <UNK> came with the <UNK> the <UNK> played while the projected curtain image was closed and i followed suit with the theater curtain closed too for <UNK> the theater curtain was closed and after five minutes i <UNK> the movie with the projection curtain closed while music used as a curtain call to the second part being the first <UNK> movie i had ever seen and being such a huge musical production i certainly enjoyed watching it every time i showed it for the run
<START> i like science fiction movies and even low rated made for tv bargain bin movies i may still find interesting well i found this one in a bargain bin and brought it as a selection to a movie night with a group of friends br br i was literally that i brought this movie br br right from the beginning the acting is bad the story is bland and the plot is almost non existent all this leads right to what the movie really was a soft core porno <UNK> movie br br the movie started with a woman prison where the prisoners are all sexy women working in some sort of mine first clue that this movie is not serious attractive women in a prison being forced to do physical labor yeah right whatever p once the plot continued it was overshadowed by pointless scenes of people having sex halfway through the movie my friends and i stopped watching it was so stupid the next day i thought that i would give the movie another chance and watch the rest i watched about another 15 minutes and gave up again br br if you are looking for a decent science fiction or even a sci fi monster movie do not watch lethal target if you want to see a low budget soft core porn that is light on plot then see lethal target
<START> the amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a good independent <UNK> film in fact the huge success of ma is also an evidence br br i'm not going to start of how important film making is as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the world br br and i'm not going to say how much our society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in our country religion politics women's rights education general health terrorism law and many many more br br along came news about the fist <UNK> movie which should've been a <UNK> to some of the issues we have especially towards the youth instead we experienced a bald movie for that matter br br the ignorance and <UNK> of the script was obvious it was as if a 13 year old had written it br br now i've heard that the budget for this film was huge i would like to know where the money went huh the effects were really ugly the editing was poor the script was you really don't know what the story is and what the director aims at from this film br br a note on the actor who played the religious brother his performance was good but with bad direction another thing with the role of the religious friends he had that is not how religious guys act here in <UNK> <UNK> they are not evil as this film <UNK> in fact they are some of the <UNK> people you'll ever meet with some really <UNK> way of living and that is what should've appeared in the film br br the youth are following the religious here because of a reason and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental and with the well formed principles the religious live on the youngsters follow them again this is what should've appeared br br we need another first film with a <UNK> writer actor director composer even cameraman so that they all work with passion towards their experiment not just for the money br br and we should do what shakespeare did hundreds of years ago we should include phrases from the <UNK> in the script of the movie as the people in our society still see art as a form of sin the challenge a <UNK> movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle
<START> this movie is by far the worst movie ever the story line is weak and never shows what happens to the people after the 20 was left they hands this really bugs me it drags on and on with out any meaning very boring the only good thing was the cast wow lots of big time actors and actress in it but besides that it was horrible terrible and repulsive do yourself a favor do not watch it br br i gave it a 1 out of 10
<START> seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release i don't quite get it why has this been such a huge hit in 1986 its <UNK> <UNK> from every scene the jokes are lame and predictable the sex scenes are exploitative and over the top that is not to say that miss does not have nice boobs the singing is the only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing a <UNK> that dates the movie firmly to the mid eighties it's really quite puzzling to me how incapable i am to grasp what <UNK> the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 and apparently still today reading my fellow <UNK> comments
<START> first real movie in this year amazing long shots sometimes with fix camera so specific for <UNK> cinema let aside dogma a true auteur film i find it it simply delighted all my senses and keep in mind how the image goes violent and painful during the scenes when he's trying to kill himself that's the point i don't think it stands up in the whole plot why if this was an ideal world couldn't you die but still you were keeping your conscience either was the real world with <UNK> rules or was a fantastic world but in this case no <UNK> like people remembering how it was before can happen br br it reminded me of <UNK> and maybe more of <UNK> brave new world especially in that part where sex was actually available to everyone since it was viewed like a right to pleasure it lacked a plot but i think it was better like this since you realized and <UNK> the whole strange behavior of everyone the absurdity and the lack of real <UNK> in this happy world br br i think also that the end was brilliant true world is indeed a <UNK> <UNK> you're eaten if you are not strong enough
<START> a woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable <UNK> of <UNK> then again are these really <UNK> it seems as though there's a ghost on the loose guess what the ghost has long black hair that hides its face and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that making for a very weird looking <UNK> <UNK> theme music plays from unexpected locations to <UNK> the arrival of the ghost and bizarre sound effects which resemble the sound of small <UNK> being <UNK> always <UNK> this hapless spirit does any of this sound familiar well if you've seen a few asian horror movies in the last 10 years it should <UNK> heavily and <UNK> from the ring one last call and a few other recent horror hits this film tries to carry an uninteresting and worn out plot to a climax but we've seen it all before avoid it unless you're desperate or haven't seen any other asian horror movies in the last 10 years
<START> <UNK> directed and <UNK> photographed psychological mystery thriller with an exceptional lead performance by a <UNK> donald sutherland and potent support roles from donald <UNK> and david the material decides to keep it all <UNK> and moves from the investigation period into the back story of the victim the seldom and quite <UNK> nature of investigation pulled me in but when it flashback to the <UNK> side showing her final days weren't as compelling and became somewhat <UNK> and stock like while the script is strongly detailed and to a certain degree complex in <UNK> us along however the final and surprising revelation should have been more bone jarring and it's not helped out by its sloppy execution howard <UNK> music score has an emotional <UNK> to its <UNK> that simply <UNK> and director claude <UNK> capable handling well for most part has a strong <UNK> and tight manner which gets the best out of moody locations and <UNK> cast the young faces lisa and <UNK> do an incredibly good job as well
<START> based on the best selling novel by the <UNK> runner is a story of friendship betrayal and the struggle for redemption set in afghanistan prior to the soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the days of <UNK> rule all of the elements are present for great drama but under the direction of marc <UNK> finding <UNK> the film lacks the kind of <UNK> emotional impact that makes for a memorable experience though it is entertaining well acted and occasionally moving br br set in 1978 in <UNK> but filmed in china because of the dangers in afghanistan the friendship that opens the film between two young boys is very real though they are miles apart in social and economic circumstances 12 year old <UNK> lives in posh surroundings with his wealthy and educated father <UNK> played by the great although his wealth seems a bit <UNK> in one of the <UNK> countries in the world though <UNK> is a loving father he <UNK> to khan shaun his friend and business associate that <UNK> is too soft and that there is something missing with that boy the family has a servant ali who <UNK> on his every need and whose son <UNK> <UNK> khan is best friend br br the two are separated not only by class but also by <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> writer is a member of the majority while <UNK> is a a minority <UNK> 10 of the population though we learn little about their traditions or social situation they are bound together by their love of <UNK> flying a popular sport in <UNK> and by reading <UNK> folk stories to <UNK> who is illiterate the <UNK> <UNK> flying competition to the boys is a big event in their lives and the cgi effects are breathtaking the <UNK> strings are covered with glass <UNK> and the winner is the one whose <UNK> string can cut down the other <UNK> in the sky <UNK> is the <UNK> runner who has an uncanny ability to locate the fallen <UNK> and bring them to <UNK> as a <UNK> after <UNK> wins the important contest however a sad event occurs that will shape the rest of his life br br bullies led by the older who later appears as a ruthless <UNK> leader attack <UNK> because he is a and brutally rape him off camera while <UNK> is too frightened to try and prevent it unable to confront his perceived lack of courage though one must wonder what if anything he could have done to help <UNK> guilt becomes the driving force in his relationship with <UNK> and their friendship becomes strained in one incident <UNK> throws at <UNK> as if begging him to fight back and <UNK> him for his <UNK> but <UNK> doesn't take the bait continuing to be loyal in spite of his friend's <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> his father to dismiss the servants and <UNK> <UNK> of stealing his watch <UNK> admits to the <UNK> even though he is innocent eventually circumstances force ali and <UNK> to leave out of shame when the russians <UNK> afghanistan <UNK> and <UNK> also leave fleeing to <UNK> and then to california where the story picks up years later br br <UNK> is forced to work at a gas station and to sell <UNK> at an open air market while <UNK> <UNK> seemingly going through the motions of living studies to become a writer at the local community college after he falls in love and marries <UNK> the daughter of a <UNK> general <UNK> finally his first novel a season of <UNK> and things look very positive when <UNK> receives a call from khan asking him to visit him in <UNK> telling him there is a way to be good again the <UNK> of guilt that has haunted him all of his life <UNK> <UNK> to go home he returns to <UNK> and with great risk goes back to an afghanistan now controlled by the <UNK> to confront the demons of his past and to discover a startling secret in the process br br the <UNK> runner is a sensitive film that deals with the internal pain that comes from knowing that you were not true to your best instincts and allows for the possibility of moving beyond shame to a new level of responsibility it also does not hide the pain caused to afghanistan by wars and revolution a pain that is perhaps represented by the suffering <UNK> unfortunately it <UNK> complex situations to the level of good guys and villains and <UNK> what actually happened the u s who engaged in anti government <UNK> <UNK> within the country from any responsibility for the disastrous war that left over one million dead and millions more disabled though we are inspired by the outstanding child actors and moved by the freedom that <UNK> flying represents the <UNK> runner <UNK> its power when it attempts to substitute melodrama for history
<START> i kind of like <UNK> it do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it for an <UNK> a non american the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much br br i <UNK> like that and <UNK> goes from being lawyers as they were in the early parts of the tv show to become super <UNK> that stops wars and <UNK> entire <UNK> its almost like watching a <UNK> video from the us army br br i still watch the show so it´s not that bad but i would prefer more episodes when and <UNK> <UNK> military <UNK> and <UNK> save the world in the future
<START> i didn't know what to expect when i rented this widescreen dvd i knew it had a cult following but i had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent don't torture a <UNK> actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end and after all was said and done it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience one major <UNK> i would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read english subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date this year it is one of my favorites the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly eve i'm afraid i was not her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or characterization by james <UNK> don wake i hope we see more of him what a great little film highly recommended to all
<START> and <UNK> bring dr <UNK> to their home to save him from the assassin while <UNK> looks in the book of shadow how to <UNK> the demon and <UNK> fight and chase on the streets to destroy him however they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches they become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house <UNK> <UNK> on cole and goes to the underworld with leo to ask him to <UNK> and <UNK> time while a fanatic woman shots <UNK> who dies the source <UNK> <UNK> to stay with him and in return he would save her sister <UNK> accepts the deal and the time is <UNK> to the moment is attacking <UNK> and dr br br all hell breaks loose is a good but incoherent episode with <UNK> dead and the power of three destroyed why should the source <UNK> time to save her but this dramatic show is certainly one of the best of the third season and let the viewers <UNK> waiting for the next episode my vote is nine br br title brazil no <UNK> back in time
<START> excellent piece of work br br i am not a <UNK> nor a <UNK> board fan but work this good about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would have been riveting a must see br br there is a lot to enjoy here excellent visuals great sound track mix huge body of documentary work both pictures and film br br the life work and love of the subject is captivating
<START> what is your freaking problem do you have nothing better to do than sit on your fat <UNK> and <UNK> about about how you find something in bad taste here's an idea go outside that's right walk outside your mom's basement that you've been living in for 13 years and go outside but i can't leave star trek is on in 30 minutes and i still haven't married that <UNK> on world of oh my god in that case stay inside alright i might have gone overboard there i mean star trek is okay but i don't really watch it that much anymore either way do you really have to write crap about mind of <UNK> it's a good show maybe you're just <UNK> your anger because that girl dumped you on world of or you're <UNK> try putting <UNK> in your <UNK>
<START> i was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it didn't live up to expectation br br a good movie has the audience <UNK> <UNK> with the main actor unfortunately this was very hard to do with samantha <UNK> br br the storyline seemed very disjointed and didn't flow as it should could have done br br <UNK> sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part beautiful scenery and the acting of <UNK> <UNK> and cliff curtis was about the only plus br br maybe by being a <UNK> i set the bar higher for <UNK> made films maybe the change of director supposedly hard to work with main actor has biased my opinion br br maybe i'm just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great br br a lot of which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special br br it could have been great it wasn't
<START> the acting is good the action is good and so is the plot if you like some good fast entertainment with an air for authentic action scenes not the hollywood looks great but is totally ridiculous kind you're in for a special treat just sit back and enjoy
<START> i think dirty dancing was a great movie they tried to make another one <UNK> nights which was good but it was nothing like dirty dancing i would like to see another dirty dancing with the same people without them i think it would be a mess a lot of times movies are made then when they try to add on more they start to change the people an make the movies go down hill i would love to see dirty dancing have another one to see what happened after they were able to be together patrick an jennifer did so well together this movie was made in 1997 its time to make another one but this time start where it left off an keep the same people in it
<START> while i agree this was a 1950s sitcom i don't feel it was typical firstly donna reed was a strong woman unlike the regular 50s sitcom <UNK> she made a stand for women's worth and <UNK> remember the episode where the tv <UNK> says just a housewife and donna stands up for all women do and represent especially those that don't work outside the home and when the women <UNK> against something in the series it was not something trivial it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men remember donna reed was married to the show's producer so she had much more <UNK> into making hers a more powerful character br br the children were intelligent but not <UNK> they were normal kids and they could act br br something else that made donna reed show stand out was not only did the children look like their parents but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation which then came out in the characters <UNK> and paul peterson have often written and <UNK> that they were treated like the children of donna reed and carl and that the adults were <UNK> protective of the child actors and treated them <UNK> donna and alex also had somewhat of a sexual chemistry that wasn't seen on the other family shows and the characters could be flawed and in major ways and yet accepted for the flaws and mistakes these were not super parents that did no wrong and had no emotional <UNK> and <UNK> they were normal people acting as normal people br br women's rights drug abuse child abuse single fathers poverty children who need good health care but can't afford it it was all shown on this show pretty groundbreaking for the era br br donna reed show didn't last for eight years without a reason and it could have possibly endured had it not been for tony <UNK> and donna reed <UNK> br br this show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality br br in summary i agree with the original poster who obviously cares for the show but i think that the donna reed show has so much more to offer than casual entertainment
<START> obvious <UNK> vehicle for ryan <UNK> it seem the studios were hoping he could play a lead tough cop and not look like he's <UNK> 16 he can't br br <UNK> jason <UNK> and snipes serve as <UNK> to <UNK> but when they're not on the screen <UNK> <UNK> his shallow acting style has nothing to <UNK> off of br br the script is a typical late 20th century <UNK> good cop bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s tv cop shows such as the streets of san francisco snipes <UNK> his role as the eternal black hat villain playing a slightly less crazed madman than his <UNK> man role however there wasn't much for snipes and <UNK> to chew on <UNK> character <UNK> he'd given up <UNK> and <UNK> something this movie badly needed <UNK> of br br truly forgettable moment ryan <UNK> on <UNK> dogma <UNK> are you a <UNK> <UNK> no it's just something i picked up along the way
<START> whenever this film gets a mention usually the discussion begins and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag scenes often overlooked are the at times <UNK> characters that <UNK> the film around the three central characters br br one character that stands out is rebel played by the great veteran australian actor max <UNK> rebel is a blind drag <UNK> who nearly runs down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any <UNK> br br in the back story we discover that rebel master <UNK> of street racing cars and he and his wife seem locked in a time <UNK> of the 1950's rebel goes on to play a small but pivotal role in teaching mike played by terry <UNK> the almost spiritual truth about street drag racing it is not speed reaction times that make a great <UNK> it is the one who feels the car best who will become the greatest br br this is best <UNK> as rebel explains to mike after a test drive you got all the agony just missing the style br br graham bond is another well credited actor <UNK> his talents as a crooked police officer looking to get in on some of the financial action being generated by the street racing the confrontation between bond and fox played by richard adds tension to the story bond not only expects results but also fox to drum up racing business br br for most of the movie fox displays a real manipulative and evil side yet in the climax he presents a sense of honor that turns the final few minutes into an extremely tense and memorable ending it is almost as if the film is on its true intention to show us the culture of street racing rather than the day to day activities of people br br one of the major complaints about the film is the script although it is nothing exciting i believe the complete lack of any chemistry between <UNK> girlfriend played by deborah <UNK> and his mechanic played by <UNK> <UNK> has more to do with the problem any scene in which these two interact simply should have been cut br br lastly in terms of the actors one truly standout performance is delivered by <UNK> <UNK> who plays a deaf and crippled member of <UNK> inner circle his back story is never explored was he injured in a race born that way what is it that fox sees value in to keep him around br br the reality of the film is simple it is about street racing and the culture behind it when the cars are flying and action sequences are in motion it is the only time director john clark and his writer barry seem really comfortable with what they are doing br br so if you are looking for an in depth exploration of human relationships moments of life defining drama then this film is not for you if your pulse races at the thought of a blown <UNK> or the iconic <UNK> phase 3 blazing away on the streets of sydney then you wont find much better than this film
<START> imagine if you will four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in st <UNK> to check for the existence of the <UNK> if you watch this in the dark and late at night you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of blair witch project what is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough but seem to lack genuine personality it seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens this movie is excellent for when you have both eyes barely open and everyone is and
<START> mild spoilers br br the premise goes like this a store gets burnt down and assistant sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which sergio agrees br br so far so good but there s a fair <UNK> of logic involved sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25 000 dollars but why come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail a very real for <UNK> for the sake of 25 grand i know i <UNK> t and seeing as you d have a criminal record no <UNK> would want to touch you with a <UNK> pole so is 25 000 dollars all that much for a life of and <UNK> <UNK> there s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise since mister has told sergio that his son did the fire he seems of the possibility that he may know too much <UNK> t alarm <UNK> be <UNK> in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something br br i guess we re not to think about such details since a <UNK> s love story <UNK> t to be an intelligent thriller it s a light hearted romantic comedy chick flick that s probably best as a girls night in looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its <UNK> but as a cynical male i <UNK> t too impressed and william baldwin does go way over the top
<START> this film is a great rampage of action and comedy it gets right in to it right from the start there's no boring build up the chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending even though my <UNK> were not satisfied the special effects worked brilliantly and were believable would have liked a different ending but it still had me <UNK> in emotions the story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment br br
<START> spoiler alert br br a cliché <UNK> film that somehow makes an anti death with dignity statement though it attempts to do the opposite washington is a <UNK> <UNK> officer who has been suffering and wanting to die for the past four years apparently he wrote his huge selling book only a year ago though so it hasn't all be despair he <UNK> for an <UNK> suicide with his doctor who will return in a week br br in the meantime he helps out on a serial killer case he <UNK> the <UNK> i don't wanna do it but i'm just so good at it cop jolie and they track down impossible clue jumping to highly unlikely conclusions in matters of moments hey that old <UNK> means that the killer has the <UNK> wife in a steam tunnel by the old building right it's laughable yet no is smart enough to figure out that doctor who's going to assist him is the killer br br when he comes to washington to murder him ahead of schedule he has a change of heart and struggles unbelievably for his life cut to the obligatory bad guy about to shoot the good guy scene when bang the gun goes off but the bad guy didn't fire no the woman steps out of the corner she has just shot him in the back
<START> i can't really remember any details of this movie except that the setting looked awfully familiar then i realized it was filmed at the lazy lizard hostel in <UNK> that was one of my favorite places to visit when i was younger and <UNK> around the country the guy who owns manages the hostel managed to get himself in the movie all i remember about the plot of the movie is that it involves <UNK> and naked women it is great to watch just for the scenery i mean the rock <UNK> if you are just looking for soft core porn you will probably be better served elsewhere i don't even know if this movie is available on tape or dvd
<START> this movie is sweet not <UNK> just warm spirited and kind i found it only mildly funny and the premise is wildly improbable but the characters are so charming especially <UNK> <UNK> that they had my full attention right from the beginning and soon had my affection too br br bonnie hunt has done a great job in her directing debut and a good job with the writing as well i highly recommend this movie and will see it again i'm sure
<START> dark reality is a saw like movie that is slightly <UNK> while the plot and story are good there is a little too much unnecessary nudity while i feel the film was technically well done the acting was <UNK> it was just a little too dark for my mood while i was watching it it basically says that there are a lot of missing people out there that will never be found and are perhaps being tortured by sick i feel that some information on the <UNK> and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some it came of as a snuff film just made for the violent content if you like to see women beaten tortured and killed then this is for you if you're looking for something a little and more <UNK> and <UNK> skip this one
<START> this movie tries to run away to the typical <UNK> fighting because i'm <UNK> to defend the <UNK> the <UNK> are all bad guys i'm against <UNK> typical of german war movies how by not talking too much about it and just referring the war and the <UNK> nevertheless i would like to see a german movie which would be something between the <UNK> of come and see and the bad <UNK> <UNK> boot i say this because <UNK> this factor the german movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the german side you easily see some of the german <UNK> relations very different from the ones in us army br br this is a movie which tries to get a real sight of what was <UNK> and i was not there and i doubt most people were there now but if i would choose one movie depicting this battle for sure would not be the all american enemy at the gates why do i say this because even the best soldiers are not hero's and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the <UNK> this goes for all the ranks and in the end you see von giving the example
<START> who should watch this film anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k dick thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with i laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spot on this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix by a long shot i didn't fall asleep in for a kick off action special effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical <UNK> that is exactly what the matrix is is gross it is disturbing and it is funny david <UNK> has done some <UNK> stuff <UNK> and some works of genius too <UNK> is another one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one of my all time favourites i can't remember the ending which is a good thing <UNK> it means i can watch it again or perhaps i never watched this film at all maybe it's an <UNK> memory or maybe it <UNK> happened to me i don't know at any rate it is now <UNK> <UNK> into my overall illusion of reality and i'm glad
<START> there is no denying that this is a bad movie the acting isn't great likewise the script acting and direction still i cannot wait until its 2 23 99 video release from anchor bay everyone knows there are several bad movies out there that have a tremendous appeal to them this one tops my list
<START> i really did not want to write a harsh review of this movie because i genuinely appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget let alone attempt something as ambitious as a sci fi br br however this movie is truly awful the acting is among some of the worst i have ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget movies that is a pretty serious <UNK> to make there are plenty of aspiring actors out there who would work on a <UNK> <UNK> scheme if they believed in the movie and what the director was trying to achieve i'm sure the actors did their best as did everybody else involved in this production but it simply was not good enough to pull off something of this <UNK> br br then there is the dialogue very poor indeed there is no excuse for that i got the impression the script was <UNK> written on the back of a beer <UNK> after some epic <UNK> session i hesitate to use the word but that's exactly what the script is i had no empathy with any of the characters indeed they <UNK> on me with the result that on more than one occasion i wanted to <UNK> a couple of them mr has <UNK> himself by taking on too many roles clint eastwood he is not again there are talented people out there willing to work on <UNK> if they believe in the project br br much has been made of the special effects in this movie for the money they are exceptional if somewhat <UNK> it is like someone said i have after effects and boy am i gonna use it whoever did the cg work was among the most talented of this crew br br quite simply the money was not available to make as ambitious a movie as this attempts to be kudos for attempting it but unfortunately it fails to reach its <UNK> goals in far too many ways br br i <UNK> everyone involved with its production i really do but for their next effort they either need to get a better producer or lower their sights to something more <UNK> br br in conclusion i cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic of film students or <UNK> <UNK> if you want to watch a true masterpiece of low budget sci fi films try the student made dark star by a certain mr john carpenter
<START> this film wasn't good at all i was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content i was forced to watch it's a well shot film about family looking to <UNK> after the death of the family's <UNK> <UNK> union dies the film stars billy dee williams as <UNK> brother well actually <UNK> union portrayed the woman in her early years which should help explain why the woman was billy dee williams older sister this had to be billy dee <UNK> worst performance in his career ever he looked as if he didn't remember his lines in a few scenes he was an unlikable hardly ever <UNK> character who <UNK> a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well the two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman lucy was trying to connect with him his other daughter didn't want anything to do with him billy <UNK> character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from paris for his sister's funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her <UNK> why they had to fool him because he didn't like attending <UNK> i know you're asking but he didn't want to attend his own sister's funeral too yes he claims he didn't like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects he didn't want anything to do with that now we're suppose to empathize with that a hole the rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters the director and editor didn't care to consider the pacing of the film the flashbacks were painful to watch it was a bad film however it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals a film that <UNK> african americans <UNK> on <UNK> to find a love that they can settle down with even if it is a healthy relationship when lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals it makes me question the judgment of black people on film in these same festivals the only films that win awards are educational films about african american culture and black films directed by <UNK> directors i'm not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color the problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses these films are often one sided forms of these films fail at <UNK> the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is <UNK> around the writers and directors never <UNK> the scenes and sequences that <UNK> your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that <UNK> it these films always <UNK> the argument what i am saying is are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content which to me means directing acting writing cinematography editing etc or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about african american culture are we suppose to expect a film like <UNK> to have a shot in the world against films like million dollar baby and <UNK> what happened to film being entertaining when i mean entertainment i mean the ritual of sitting in the dark staring at the screen <UNK> tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying meaningful emotional experience why can't these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching why can't these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest telling the truth i believe we have no responsibility to cure social <UNK> or <UNK> faith in humanity to <UNK> the spirits of society or even express our inner being we have only one responsibility to tell the truth robert <UNK> now that's something i totally agree with these same black film festivals put down <UNK> and <UNK> as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks however it's an honest film about a <UNK> with a dream a <UNK> can't dream i recall the last time i saw a real <UNK> he was a human being and aren't they <UNK> and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large not just in the black community but all over the powers that be in black hollywood believe that films like this are making <UNK> americans look bad in the eyes of others as if others don't know that there are <UNK> in the hood the truth is until african american people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world then our films will never have a chance in the world this film was awful the best thing was the cinematography and <UNK>
<START> lonely among us definitely is one of the best first season episodes the storyline although somewhat confusing creates a lot of suspense supported by the creepy <UNK> driven soundtrack this is a typically alien body invasion scenario but finally turning out to no evil purpose the death of assistant chief engineer <UNK> to me was an accident the two <UNK> species deliver an entertaining frame best make up so far finally adding a little black humor to the series the final scene patrick stewart obviously enjoys stepping out a bit of his <UNK> character and exploring some new <UNK> as does data by posing as sherlock holmes another all time classic the special effects are also convincing and director cliff <UNK> did his job well he is the first one trying to compensate <UNK> lack in acting ability by <UNK> her looks she does look beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress <UNK> her appearance a lot <UNK> lightning scene on the bridge gives him a slight air of the emperor of star wars return of the jedi which is a personal impression but made me smile br br there's also some playing with the lighting of the corridors <UNK> night aboard and the first moving camera pulling back from <UNK> when he's entering the <UNK> room to <UNK> into the cloud nice work the clever cutting creating continuing dialog through different scenes <UNK> <UNK> report rounds up the impression of a really well crafted <UNK> episode the first one where even wesley <UNK> seemed almost tolerable br br the ending however is a bit confusing just as if the producers were running out of time p for <UNK> is a little far fetched and his return far too easy but that can be left aside regarding the many strong moments this episode has to offer
<START> joe is the movie about the dark side of the force of the 1960's in america and susan sarandon had nice boobs this movie scared me so much when i saw it in the theatre that i never liked peter boyle until young frankenstein and was still quite <UNK> of him even after that comedy looking back now from today's experience this film seems current again in being direct and to the point of half the <UNK> of john joe the <UNK> <UNK> and their fear of <UNK> a black man as president of the usa in the coming weeks a black <UNK> would be seen as sweet revenge of the but bound to again bring fire to many minds if not the streets this time by joe <UNK> so the spirit of joe in the film is <UNK> in the campaign of joe the <UNK> still i love to be american and be terrified at both and by the knowledge that they illustrate what ironically gregory peck said our <UNK> law also is a living breathing reality god help us
<START> this film is based on a true story the author of the novel bearing the same title had a brother who turned mentally ill i found this film very moving following the main character's path down into illness to see how he tries to cope with life after <UNK> and how he makes friends at the mental institution it all is very convincing there are quite a few <UNK> funny incidents also in the <UNK> the title of it gives nothing away concerning the story you must watch it to understand and listen to the music which is <UNK> and turning your heart and soul upside down and back as the film moves on a must see for everyone
<START> this is a good <UNK> for a study of corporate power and the between required public life and the need for <UNK> robert taylor has been <UNK> by corporate head <UNK> <UNK> as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation he sends him to england to <UNK> a deal where taylor is both taken <UNK> by the <UNK> and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a <UNK> while he's at it he comes back handed having done his duty but having told the truth to the english about his motives he attempts to marry the <UNK> rather than the <UNK> niece and so begins an attempt by <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> as a suitable wife for a corporate executive it could have been <UNK> <UNK> and less romantic the amount of time spent on the romance <UNK> the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate <UNK> br br somehow the costume design was nominated <UNK> for an oscar it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress <UNK> studio politics at work yet again no doubt br br what is however is the black and white <UNK> cinematography which is excellent this if anything deserved the oscar <UNK> it was <UNK> first film in b w br br not as good as it could have been but not terrible either
<START> this show was a pleasant surprise after watching mad tv on a saturday night spike is an excellent host that you can tell is still getting used to it but he is doing great <UNK> to his new job i can imagine it being a difficult transition from writer seinfeld to host however unlike a lot of new talk show <UNK> he does not let <UNK> ride while trying to figure out what to do next he is quick minded and each segment and section rolls into one another smoothly it also doesn't hurt that he's kinda sexy in a nerdy type of way so he's not hard on the eyes like leno or <UNK> i can't remember the exact episode date that was my favorite but i especially loved the idiot <UNK> skit with a fake j lo and katie holmes great new show
<START> awful awful awful br br i loved the original film it was funny charming and had heart this piece of junk has none of those things br br <UNK> jokes from the original film stupid plots bad animation different voices with the exception of and that sound nothing like the ones in the original especially <UNK> br br the characters are off model the animation is flat and boring it's just a bad job all around br br and why is a jerk again i thought he had <UNK> but since when are these tv spin offs loyal to the original rolls eyes br br i'm sorry but there is nothing <UNK> about this at all br br avoid at all costs
<START> one of earliest films made in france is possibly his only political satire the story of the <UNK> who wanted a king mirrors its title as a group of high feel that democracy has gone flat so they demand a king from <UNK> to rule their land when he sends down a <UNK> the <UNK> ask for another king saying the <UNK> is but political <UNK> <UNK> sends down a hungry <UNK> this time whose frog <UNK> eyes <UNK> the town's residents as the original is about to slide down the <UNK> he speaks his moral let well enough alone this film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet <UNK> <UNK> tricks the audience into believing they are all moving at once by keeping the background in constant motion and <UNK> only about six <UNK> or so at one time the slightly corny dialogue and problems with lighting in a few places <UNK> the quality of repeat viewings however its historical significance in <UNK> life make it of importance to watch his feelings towards government immediately following his flee from russia are likely expressed in this film in addition the technical <UNK> of <UNK> so many characters at once in a stop motion film is astounding
<START> now i love bad old movies as much as most people and i understand that a budget is a budget that said planet of the dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get the thing has no actors and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming <UNK> there are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid the only thing not wasted was paper the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long surely no one actually wrote dialogue this pointless i'm constantly amazed that such movies ever got made much less released i'm only glad i didn't pay to see this waste of time it's 75 minutes of my life i'll never get back
<START> the film had no help at all promotion wise if there was an advertising <UNK> on tv or radio i didn't see hear it the only newspaper ad i saw was on it's opening weekend a <UNK> b w head shot photo of andy as val com behind jail bars with <UNK> wanted runaway robot which was also the poster in front of the 3 movie theaters i saw it at not the nice little color poster on this site with of all the cast and cartoon of which really wasn't that good they ought to have used an action scene from the film itself didn't they have an <UNK> photographer a poster is supposed to help a <UNK> audience decide if they want to see the movie there were so many people who couldn't get into their sold out choice and wanted to know what was about and that poster didn't help that <UNK> <UNK> and the only other photos <UNK> to papers were so <UNK> in b w that they were worthless there was no trailer for the film only a slide at one theater <UNK> of the word inside a heart shape with a <UNK> arrow through it and one that was a totally black picture just andy and voices saying val com my pleasure center is so is mine do you think we ought to tell our owners that is no help to people who hadn't been aware of the movie br br during the filming andy told <UNK> that he couldn't eat once his plastic lips were applied so he would load up on breakfast and fast during the day's shoot i don't know what <UNK> did but at the time i'd wondered why they didn't just <UNK> <UNK> drinks through long <UNK> or eat astronaut style food via <UNK> br br phil co the baby robot seemed to have been the pre <UNK> to short johnny five with the same eyes similar face i've been trying to find if they had the same designer but no help i have vintage magazine <UNK> about the film and the design team was immensely proud of their work and were going for a special award for their innovative device to create smoke for <UNK> just shortly thereafter did not use that device though they ought to have for return of the <UNK> scenes with <UNK> the <UNK> a man created steam around <UNK> by blowing <UNK> smoke into a tube joking that all he needed was a glass of <UNK> and he'd be a happy man i thought that using of real <UNK> products was <UNK> to people who were upset by smoke br br john williams who had then recently succeeded the late great arthur <UNK> as the <UNK> of the boston pops which was then a ratings hit but it never <UNK> from death and is now a shadow of it's former glory was using the show to promote films with which he <UNK> the music he'd premiered the empire strikes back score there and you would think he'd have helped along by playing a few numbers there the one thing that critics had liked of this film was <UNK> score yet it was not available for purchase i saw one <UNK> album in 1982 with half half another film but it disappeared i only just tonight saw the cd listed on this site and have ordered it if i can ever get a <UNK> and time to type out the <UNK> i'd like to create a tribute site i liked the movie and don't care what <UNK> say br br the only trouble with the film was that near the end it was messed up logic wise the robots ran away from the factory to have the freedom to decide their own fate make their own choices yet when the <UNK> owners tell them that phil needs to go to the factory to have a purpose <UNK> into him they don't even question it they just glance <UNK> at each other and they go along the way each of the adults lose <UNK> power and die they aren't really dead as they are robots and only need new <UNK> yet it is treated as death with little phil crying over them and rolling away so what was the point of this phil never gets back to the factory and gets a purpose and of course the <UNK> owners could've driven them or given them all <UNK> with back up <UNK> but the real point was to have this poignant scene where the robots all wore down and phil is left to cry br br at the end val com is a golf <UNK> and <UNK> com is i'm not sure what is an entertainer what else is he supposed to be i'm not sure that they made it clear the <UNK> owners seem to be taking it easy lying on <UNK> <UNK> drinking <UNK> from phil their bartender <UNK> and new daughter i think the name is maybe it's doesn't seem to be much more than a table <UNK> br br there is missing footage which is sad from photos i <UNK> that the stuff missing includes a sweet scene where phil is having a christmas with val <UNK> him with a <UNK> <UNK> wheel <UNK> is <UNK> a horn has taken the <UNK> helmet to give to phil as we saw and they have christmas trees i don't know if any missing footage supplies better logic or if the writers just couldn't think of a better crisis resolution the film was <UNK> to <UNK> 75 minutes to pair it with other failing films no other reason than that for a dvd i would love to be in on creating as i want to see interviews with the cast crew and john williams and the <UNK> interview the making of footage and and <UNK> the missing footage to make it better
<START> i think that complete <UNK> is a very good tv show and they should make many more episodes it is one of my favourites it is very funny and it is really good acting i say that you should give them a chance to do more episodes that they can and they should they should put complete <UNK> on <UNK> more than what they do i'm sure that many people will agree with me i like the tv show because it is a very good programme for people our age and it is very funny i also like complete <UNK> because it isn't always about the same thing and things that happen could be real unlike other <UNK> when they advertised it i didn't like the sound of it but i watched it for the first time and i loved it complete <UNK> is an excellent comedy and i miss it being on tv i can't really compare complete <UNK> with any other tv series because it is different
<START> lets be realistic here this is one of the worst shows i have ever seen my wife and kids showed real promise in its first season and only went down hill after that it is so bad that words do not describe the acting and writing are so dreadful on a consistent basis i wonder if damon wayans was producing such an atrocious show on purpose from top to bottom every performance is ridiculous damon wayans completely phones it in and george gore ii is so horrible i cringe at every over acted line can anyone really watch this show and find it to be entertaining let alone funny please i <UNK> you do not watch this show as soon as tv stop picking this up in <UNK> we can finally be rid of this absolute garbage
