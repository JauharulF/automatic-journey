<START> my friends and i saw this at the san diego black film festival it was great <UNK> is a strong black woman and <UNK> reminds me of my grandmother br br <UNK> is fine seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission can someone forward me his contact info br br my friend thinks <UNK> is the <UNK> of the two she's been a <UNK> fan for years though so she might be a little biased the cousins were funny and just as <UNK> as <UNK> described them lol br br i am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters
<START> now before people start having a breakdown about this movie those who play <UNK> anyway this is a film it's been given the hollywood treatment to entertain people and therefore those who play <UNK> myself included are naturally gonna pick holes in the choreography of the game in the film it is a decent film and bring to the attention the morals and ideas behind the game of <UNK> br br the film is based on a real team a real coach and his work helping guide kids in the right direction to be better people in the future and also is based on real people who have played for the <UNK> team its just a typical sports movie with a character who is misguided and eventually finds his way on the right track again through the <UNK> medium in this case is generally a feel good movie that is enjoyable but has flaws in terms of it's portrayal of the game however like i said it is a film under the hollywood treatment
<START> again like many other tv shows a certain actor actresses in thrust into the <UNK> in this case miranda <UNK> having built up her reputation in previous movies series especially by <UNK> and dan schneider she is now the star of the show gets to sing the soundtrack which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that wonderful it creates as much <UNK> in popularity vs her other co stars especially nathan who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode except want to fight music would never have met the <UNK> without this show and her singing the main theme song which was not written by her and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby let's not forget that she lip sync sings her song live too is that how you create <UNK> nowadays br br back to the show <UNK> reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini <UNK> <UNK> type <UNK> and mentioned <UNK> many times through out <UNK> and seen in many cases though not of the other actresses are mentioned <UNK> have been mentioned once <UNK> let us not forget oh my god a come phrase are any of the <UNK> actors christian granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids i'm surprised at the <UNK> of mentions of the female especially in the first episode where the phrase <UNK> boobs were mentioned i'm not sure whether kids would thus <UNK> from saying that at home in school afterwards br br it's not that i'm against the mentioning or showing of female <UNK> which girls will wear but for a show from <UNK> the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff i doubt that other <UNK> shows have such content in them br br as mentioned is other reviews the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts for example when the character sam cries how on earth is that a time to laugh it <UNK> people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence br br as mentioned <UNK> is made the star of the show and thus <UNK> the <UNK> fame and support from die hard fans who even <UNK> a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down see http www youtube com watch v <UNK> is the second star of the show but she faces competition from <UNK> in the music industry compare the popularity of her new single vs covers as noted the third co star nathan is the least noted of the lot he is portrayed as a <UNK> boy who suffers the <UNK> of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character's crush on <UNK> <UNK> beyond that isn't breaking into the music industry and as fame grows with each episode falls behind i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors br br the content of the show is of course fictional but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times thus the laughter track is used it also contains several continuity errors how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine us special forces have their own <UNK> and the air force doesn't use us <UNK> that is for <UNK> a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy br br once again it is a show that is <UNK> with mentions of the female <UNK> exposure of skin and over used laughter tracks it is a series which <UNK> a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs actions are excessive supported by her fans leaving her co stars behind
<START> this 1988 movie was shown recently on a cable channel we wanted to see another film which supposedly was starting but because a mix up rent a cop was shown in that time <UNK> never having seen it when it was <UNK> released we took a chance at it bad decision br br one wonders what possessed the people behind the picture to go ahead with rent a cop or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution it appears this movie <UNK> big time this film doesn't add anything new to its genre it's totally predictable as once the basic premise is shown we know how it will end br br burt reynolds plays a wooden church this actor can do better but who knows what was going on behind the scenes or perhaps the direction given to him by jerry london had the opposite effect mr reynolds has one expression throughout the movie he just doesn't register any emotion at all br br lisa minnelli as the hooker who witnessed the original slaughter at the chicago hotel makes no sense at all the romance between her della and church seems phony from the beginning she and mr reynolds play one dimensional characters br br don't waste your time with this turkey
<START> perhaps one of the best movies ever made <UNK> and friendship runs deep and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship as a <UNK> i can honestly say this epic is as accurate as it gets brothers fighting brothers can you imagine what life must have been living during those times the best part of the movie for me was when the south <UNK> general grant is <UNK> president lincoln to really stick it to the south he says mr president a lot of folks want the south to bleed over what they've done president lincoln turns to him and in a very tired voice says the south has <UNK> enough and so have we i burst into tears and take a deep breath what a president it's like a father saying his son has been <UNK> enough and despite his anger he realizes his point has been made this war was a very dark time for our young country and it had to be fought president lincoln knew this i'm <UNK> everyone who reads this to watch this movie and add it to your dvd collection then thank god that our country was <UNK> as jesus said a house divided against itself cannot stand
<START> i saw the biopic of ed wood many years ago tim burton <UNK> loving homage to this extremely <UNK> but yet enthusiastic filmmaker br br then i saw plan 9 and it actually <UNK> me to no end a silly story kind of bad production values but still entertaining and even funny br br then this what can you make of it well since wood has been reported as being a cross <UNK> it is startling to see a movie that deals with it like a cartoon yes there are some stabs at teaching the audience something about the subject but mostly this is some kind of really twisted self parody br br one of it's problems is that it has a hundred points of view on one hand it is a <UNK> for tolerance another portrays <UNK> as a disease and finally it tells the audience okay if you are now then wait until you see this the problem must have been that wood had to compromise in order for the film to be made you can almost sense it when you see the opening title from the producer personally <UNK> by so where are we this is neither a serious subject movie or an all out br br the entertainment value is practically <UNK> the wooden voice over is mildly amusing but only because it sounds so misguided this was made in the 50s though so one can argue that was brave making a film that even mentioned the word <UNK> it all comes down to what the film itself is trying to <UNK> against the rape scene while mild is there simply to do that br br so sorry this is a misfire but the <UNK> is not <UNK> alone
<START> i have to agree with the previous reviewer although the <UNK> did a great job of playing the possessed girl i seriously don't think that isabelle the character she was playing was possessed i have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not i also had to watch some parts of it over again to make it clear as to what the letter said what the characters' names were and i'm still not clear on a few things that happened whether they were real or not i'm trying to find the original story that it was based on to compare facts but i can't seem to find anything about it online br br it wasn't a bad movie but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy special effects wise the movie wasn't bad for a grade b pretty much and those possession scenes made it all worth while that is if you have nothing better to do lol
<START> national <UNK> christmas vacation 2 cousin <UNK> island adventure 2003 randy quaid <UNK> flynn dana <UNK> jake thomas sung hi lee eric <UNK> fred <UNK> ed <UNK> d nick embarrassing direct to video flop has <UNK> cousin eddie and family on an <UNK> paid vacation to the south pacific by his boss hoping the <UNK> won't sue his company after being bitten by a smarter lab monkey idiotic spin off can't measure up to any of the vacation films even european vacation with a question of whether or not the filmmakers thought the script was actually funny not even quaid <UNK> or <UNK> can make it remotely watchable <UNK> min not rated
<START> <UNK> is <UNK> masterpiece full of drama emotion and powerful memorable music the <UNK> must have rolled in his grave when this <UNK> travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap <UNK> and its portrayal of the naive but <UNK> as a horny <UNK> opera certainly can be adapted to cinema look at magnificent la <UNK> but when a work is as superb as <UNK> it doesn't need cheap gimmicks it might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the <UNK> with second rate sound quality at that
<START> <UNK> 4 is a good movie a bit of a twist to the series as it takes place in space not in an <UNK> community good effects and acting make this movie a must see i would recommend this to horror science fiction fans everywhere br br 10 out of 10 br br fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive sleep away camp <UNK> party massacre and other full moon pictures flicks for other <UNK> check out the other comments i have sent in by <UNK> on my name above this comment section
<START> i've watched hundreds of kung fu movies and i've heard some good thing about this movie so i decided to give it a try what i saw was one of the worst displays of movie making i've ever seen br br i can't help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in hong kong in this movie everyone overacts to the point of stupidity even conan the barbarian had some <UNK> this movie just has half evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no self respect the <UNK> character should've be killed for sucking so much she really didn't deserve to live <UNK> the end the entire movie was a melodramatic mess with horrible acting bad directing and bad action they should've just <UNK> this movie to 'the stupid one armed <UNK> with a blade here's a question why do some director use quick cuts for some action movies answer to can hide the <UNK> of the actors nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow the movie tried so hard to show intensity but it became almost laughable please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kung fu movies or any taste in movies
<START> this is a stunning movie raw and <UNK> moving it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie <UNK> to monstrous consequences all of the main players are <UNK> tom <UNK> broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of <UNK> for <UNK> and hands going up to faces among males and females alike julian <UNK> has <UNK> again he's a national treasure <UNK> park vanity fair mary <UNK> and now this can he do no wrong go and see it this is a film for real grown ups

<START> japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own while that may be true it applies to all except for one thing that being major league baseball but not to worry mr baseball is there to try and change all that but just who will change whom is the part of the movie that really makes it rock tom <UNK> is one of my favorite actors and really shines on in his comedic roles the storyline may be true to life however the subplot is dead on the japanese people are a gentle <UNK> people with ways and traditions very different than those of western society all of these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable funny film it's definitely worth the watch
<START> now i realize that most people on here trash young warriors or <UNK> it as so bad it's funny type entertainment but let me make something clear it's actually a quality piece of low rent action if you're willing to watch such cinema without a critical eye in fact it's a good deal more entertaining and thought provoking than the bulk of the action films of the 80s br br the key is in the film's subject matter i'm always a sucker for movies that tackle the subject of <UNK> especially when they <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> of the characters involved young warriors may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first death wish film and yes i do think the first one had both of those elements but it's trying to be different from the run of the mill cannon films of the period in that it's genuinely unique br br the plot is simple don't worry there won't be spoilers a group of college student <UNK> change their ways when one of their family members is <UNK> by a tough street gang the students take to the streets in an effort to combat general street crime being that they don't know who the gang responsible is they eventually <UNK> some heavy <UNK> machine guns and <UNK> and <UNK> the night fully armed however these are not <UNK> types they're vulnerable inexperienced <UNK> who make <UNK> <UNK> nearly each time they set out to clean up the city usually with their frat <UNK> dog in <UNK> they finally figure out who the gang is and go after them but by then you won't be expecting a standard climax in which the good guys walk away <UNK> br br one thing about the film that struck me as strange yet effective is that the bulk of the first act offers no indication that we'll be seeing any action or violence later on as it's treated like a goofy frat comedy you'd see on <UNK> up all night where i believe this was actually shown at one point the comedy set up actually <UNK> me into forgetting that the vhs cover showed a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun <UNK> to his back then when the violence finally arrives it's not fun or cute at all it's shockingly disturbing from that point on the film becomes a full blooded <UNK> action yarn containing some startling <UNK> and gore br br the acting while nothing special is far more <UNK> than i anticipated james van <UNK> who plays the protagonist gives his all and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of movie the rest of the cast is equally invested including the always <UNK> ernest <UNK> as the hero's cop father the cinematography is also above par and the action scenes are handled with a level of <UNK> that i personally wasn't expecting br br i can understand why some people thought this movie was worthless as much of it is extremely dated but those <UNK> struck me as nothing short of cool in and of themselves van character is studying animation and his <UNK> early 80s style work that's on display in several scenes is a retro film <UNK> psychedelic wet dream i'm sure most contemporary viewers would <UNK> those very moments as low points in the movie but i disagree also joe <UNK> soundtrack which sounds like it could have only been recorded in <UNK> seemed particularly fitting and enjoyable regardless of how old it seems today br br young warriors is one of my favorite action films of the 80s and i highly urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look sadly however it's only been released on vhs as of this writing and it isn't being shown on tv these days a nice dvd presentation would make me moon walk around my living room with such intensity that i'm sure my <UNK> would <UNK> in the meantime i <UNK> you all to go on ebay or amazon and <UNK> up the ten bucks or whatever for the old big box tape it really is a remarkable <UNK> of ambitious trash cinema
<START> i got hold of a <UNK> copy of this i had seen it several years ago my only recent experience had been mystery science theatre where it was <UNK> <UNK> one never really gets a chance to get into these movies because of all the <UNK> i love the <UNK> of fifties horror movies they give us a pompous lecture on the defense systems near the <UNK> these were there to protect us from the expected soviet invasion but they should come in handy given the threat of very large insects br br this particular one flies for some reason despite its <UNK> made of the stuff <UNK> are made of they can still <UNK> off air to air <UNK> and <UNK> fighter planes br br anyway it's more fun first the obligatory deranged case who saw the flying thing <UNK> his heels in a hospital it just teaches one see an <UNK> as big as a house keep your mouth shut i wonder if the poor guy got to go home after they found the bug br br otherwise this is a pretty ordinary effort it follows the usual efforts to come up with a way of the stubborn bug and leaves us open to other possibilities the russians next time i still get a kick out of these films and this one is <UNK>
<START> not like i went in expecting a lot out of it but i was at least hoping for a fun dumb big budget movie this isn't even that this item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies i've ever seen and believe me i've seen a lot of them bad acting zero characterization little to no thought almost non existent plot and that that's there you can drive semi <UNK> through the holes in sure it has action and is loud and has more action and more noise and blood and action these things alone do not make a good or even halfway decent movie beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made all i can assume is they haven't seen many i suggest seeing near dark instead
<START> i remember when this show came out it was originally advertised as a mini series at the end of the last episode it said to be continued to the <UNK> of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing it ended as it was supposed to so yes you can blame the series for having no ending the plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher but it was a boring show that way too long and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would so they never made any more quite a few of the comments blame its <UNK> and lack of ending on the viewing public when the truth is that for this show that is not the case it ended the way it was actually planned to end it is just a lousy ending
<START> i saw this originally on channel 4 uk and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me however i saw it on irish tv recently and there was an added narration by roy <UNK> we're going to need a bigger boat this ruined the film for me his <UNK> monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film and if anything takes from the films brilliance i wonder at the new dvd version that has no roy due to legal reasons would stop people from buying it well believe me the film is much better for it br br cheers br br <UNK>
<START> this film is striking only in its <UNK> and use of cliches sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending but don't be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly only a little unexpectedly though nothing worth watching the thing through for br br from the <UNK> and <UNK> hero to the <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> team the characters were entirely wooden and obvious the two fbi agents smith and <UNK> <UNK> gave some hope of humour but that came to nothing br br i am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film a turkey br br
<START> i have seen this movie and anybody who has every been with the marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie it is a must have for any collection jack <UNK> does an excellent job as the hard <UNK> <UNK> my father went to marine boot camp at camp and says this movie is so accurate that he feels like he is back in basic training there is a line in the movie where jack character gets mad at a boot for killing a sand flea well let me tel you there are nothing but sand <UNK> at the camp i have been there and can appreciate it as a matter of fact the exit to the camp is las which in english means city of the <UNK> you must watch the movie to appreciate what i am saying anybody who is into wwii movies all the battles start right here with the <UNK> sgt a must have for you collection
<START> this movie can't decide what it is a soft porno or a sf movie not enough plot for a real movie but way too much for a porno br br in a galaxy far far away a good princess we know she's good because she has long blonde hair wears a white <UNK> is polite and is <UNK> <UNK> about her dying mother when we first see her <UNK> the kingdom over her elder sister who is evil and we know this because she has dark hair and wears too much makeup <UNK> her male sexual slaves <UNK> and <UNK> her lip all the time and talks <UNK> about the horrors she'll <UNK> when she's queen the evil princess gets upset and tries to stage a coup but the good sister gets away to earth of course she <UNK> buck naked in a bar during a wet t shirt contest it really goes downhill from there the acting is ludicrous the dialog sounds like it was written for a porno and the general storyline is ridiculous there's not even enough skin to make happy the sort of person who'd watch this for skin i love good bad movies and this one's not even enjoyable on a bad movie level
<START> this is one of those wonderful martial arts movies that begin with two <UNK> of tough gang members facing off in a park and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts it turns out they all know karate and kung fu the ever wooden <UNK> <UNK> plays as usual a cynical deadpan good cop this time in los angeles she and her police partners are trying to break up a ring and when that plot line is exhausted the story just switches over to something else and <UNK> becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy great looking <UNK> within the film's obviously rock bottom budget there's some helicopter action some <UNK> action some car chases a <UNK> where <UNK> beats up everyone in a country western bar some swimming pool scenes with <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and a surprisingly good <UNK> chase about a dozen and a half cops get <UNK> down a lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense don't worry about them and <UNK> is a federal crime so where the hell is the fbi i guess they were too busy the fight choreography was done by <UNK> <UNK> frequent co star richard taylor whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie he also tended to make <UNK> a better actress when they appeared together and frankly she could use it she seems tired and bored and does her best acting in guardian angel when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues the dog almost out acts her she also wears some of the most god awful clothing any leading lady has ever worn in any movie loose <UNK> leg <UNK> with pale acid washed areas over each <UNK> were the most shocking the other actors are all over the map you can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way hey me and some other guys i know are going to be in a movie you wanna be in it too no dude i'm serious then there are the <UNK> professionals the most fun is <UNK> the stunning french model and veteran of red shoe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> place and of playing many many other variations on the sexy french <UNK> here she plays a <UNK> killer as if she were in <UNK> or an <UNK> episode and not some direct to cable trash like this there's also the tall dark and handsome daniel now a regular on the bold and the beautiful john <UNK> who has played a <UNK> old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here and the veteran arab character actor perhaps best known as <UNK> <UNK> from the mummy and the mummy returns for these professionals guardian angel must be the most laughable entry on their <UNK> i gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters who are enthusiastic martial arts students both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change they're still a bit too young to care what a low quality picture this really was and just enjoyed cheering <UNK> on as she did her <UNK> high kicking stick fighting thing if you like this kind of flick you could probably enjoy it on that level
<START> most of these reviews are dead on so i'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions i've seen on here br br while the characters seem and look young hence the controversy the actor actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 <UNK> here in the usa that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to <UNK> it br br i'm sorry not to have seen more by sean in this movie at least his expressions are <UNK> and obvious you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry afraid or confused had a healthy career who's life was cut unfortunately short by cancer in late 2006 she was a beautiful and talented actress br br vhs tapes of friends can be found at amazon com occasionally but usually for a significant price i've seen it as low as 60 or so and as high as <UNK> as of this comment there were two for that price the sequel video paul michelle is not quite as <UNK> and can be <UNK> when available on amazon for between 16 and 70 on average
<START> j carol <UNK> and ralph morgan star in a movie about a mad scientist in love with a daughter when his advances are <UNK> he <UNK> the father with a <UNK> disease so that she will be forced to come to him to get a cure br br god this is awful its dull and boring and you'll nod off before the <UNK> gets i was on the verge <UNK> it picks up once things are set in motion but this is one of those old movies better remembered then seen again br br if you must see it come in late br br 4 out of 10
<START> this was truly a tense and dark episode excellently executed wonderful acting and atmospheric directing is one of my favorite episodes along with and <UNK> these are quite good in dark atmosphere in my case it seem quite realistic to me their paranoia their suspicion and their ever growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors however had a problem that i got over after a few watches it was too short i wanted more br br overall had what 98 of all x files episodes have excellent acting intense story writing gritty directing all the works br br 10 out of 10
<START> unreal after reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers i was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews <UNK> all rated this film a 10 upon comparison with other great films these reviewers felt that the quick and the undead is a better film than the <UNK> sense 8 2 saving private ryan 8 4 lord of the rings 8 7 godfather 9 5 gladiator 8 1 and dawn of the dead 7 8 to name a few hopefully these <UNK> <UNK> their next <UNK> <UNK> that they hear of because it is completely obvious that these reviews have been br br i was led to believe that this film featured a unique concept in the genre of zombie film making sadly upon watching the quick and the undead it is obvious that these reviews were generated by people who either were involved in the production or have a <UNK> interest in the films <UNK> financial success nothing <UNK> this in my mind more than hearing that a portion of this film was shot in texas were <UNK> <UNK> of the early <UNK> <UNK> the film are from the zombie film horror b movie culture on a whole is a <UNK> group but this film is sadly beyond any redemption the characters are recycled and the plot poor the film quality was not bad enough to be labeled camcorder and at least they used a film quality camera the acting is horrible the star trying <UNK> to come off as a clint eastwood wanna be clone christ on a bike even the lead actor's name is clint he was just terrible the only resemblance to clint eastwood is that the lead is using the wood from eastwood's name in his style of acting the zombie makeup was above halloween party quality but not applied completely to the full undead cast members <UNK> of zombies were not made up on their hands the plot was so hokey that it had me hoping for a power <UNK> a <UNK> on the dvd <UNK> or that the zombies would turn their attention on the director maybe the film has worth to some viewers but not for my hard earned dollar luckily i used my free rental <UNK> to check out this dvd maybe this film will be rescued by <UNK> entertainment <UNK> named releasing a special <UNK> dvd which will tie up loose flaws and deliver the promised goods some how i think <UNK> lets just hope that their next release the flesh keeper is truly a keeper of a film and not a <UNK> generation recycled version of the texas chainsaw massacre fingers crossed here folks but only if you care
<START> note i've tried not to give away any important plot twists or the ending but if you're concerned about that please think about viewing the film before reading further thanks br br this was obviously a fairly high budget production released by paramount the story follows the supposedly true exploits of man jack shepard in <UNK> london he was a who got <UNK> into a life of crime by the <UNK> thief taker to save his brother's life after being double crossed by the thief taker we turns into a sort of robin hood type figure and <UNK> the support of the common folk he proceeds to make escapes from several <UNK> including the infamous <UNK> as well as having time to entertain numerous noble ladies br br i really enjoyed the film even though the plot was a bit predictable the film was shot in and <UNK> ireland and the sets were very well done and seemed realistic i think captured the <UNK> atmosphere of london in the <UNK> quite well and i enjoyed his creative use of camera angles and unlike many films depicting this period pulls no punches in showing us the <UNK> conditions in which the poor lived in one scene several folks fight over a meat pie that has rolled through the filth in the street br br overall i really enjoyed this film i will admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and underlying political commentary that <UNK> next film the last valley has a <UNK> to the vietnam war but it still merits a viewing or two it is <UNK> that it has not ever to my knowledge been released on video or dvd
<START> brian keith as cole and richard <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> make excellent villains they just love <UNK> the locals in the most brutal way possible and <UNK> <UNK> at any suggestion that there might be a more <UNK> way to achieve their ends it's a pity that <UNK> <UNK> glenn ford gets in their way
<START> i never read the book now i don't really want to i had no clue what this movie was about when i walked into the theatre i still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across but i do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life two precious hours i can never get back br br the storyline was so predictable it's laughable werewolves or something a very romeo and juliet type plot i predicted the within five minutes into the movie and i was correct br br the acting isn't horrible the only two cool characters in the movie were the british cousin guy and the rambo graphic novel the other characters are too the dialogue is very bland and predictable br br the absolute worst part of the movie is the <UNK> between the humans and the wolves if you wanted something kick ass like van you're gonna be really upset imagine a bright light then a wolf yep that's about it br br just avoid this movie period especially if you've read the book because you'll just wanna punch babies
<START> although i don't like <UNK> at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago i still think it is one of the best coming of age movies i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch i saw the opening titles of that movie and then i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there it really affected me personally i still remember how i felt when i first saw it i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a shy boy <UNK> about kissing his dream girl no offense but if that was an american movie you would certainly see at a certain point mainly climax the shy boy making love to his girl and i really can't grasp this <UNK> concepts till now i have a simple request if anyone knows how to get this movie on a dvd by mail please let me know cause i need a shot of memories thanks
<START> touching bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 year old girl who finds out that she's adopted and is determined to find her birth mother the film's major success is the performance of p s who plays the girl the first half of the film is very good there are a few really good songs too especially the number that introduces the protagonist unfortunately the film's second half which takes place in war torn <UNK> <UNK> feels like an entirely different and disappointing movie it's big on explosions and special effects with <UNK> <UNK> soldiers and rebels <UNK> <UNK> running from <UNK> and being <UNK> by stunt <UNK> all the film can offer as insight are cheap <UNK> like some day there must come peace and perhaps the children will find a way the final sequence where the daughter and mother are reunited is good but so over the top with the music and a well timed <UNK> that it feels like a cheat i know i know it's all in the style of bollywood but this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple powerful central story bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times too
<START> honestly i have to admit that i go and see certain stupid films based on the hype they have generated or are currently <UNK> this dumb salman khan govinda feature is one of those stupid films okay by now we've all seen starring will smith as a date doctor trying to help out odd people find true then why would we need to see salman khan re <UNK> this <UNK> lies the 64 000 question in case you were wondering govinda plays the oddball in search of the love of his life an <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> br br lara <UNK> is along to play eva <UNK> and real life love <UNK> pretty much plays her character like every role you've see her in thus far no stretch no acting required and for nearly three and a half hours we get tortured with spoofs of other bollywood films and characters or better yet we get treated to low rate performances of past hit films <UNK> <UNK> co stars f
<START> not even cooking can save this disjointed idiotic nonsense starring as a tv chef from the food channel who with help of the crew to try to make the show better poor plot and stupid script throw this show down the drain robert <UNK> wasted in the poorly supporting role and sadly this was his last one ever r i p br br this is the worst show of 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade br br i feel very sorry for for making this sitcom he even said himself it <UNK> br br it's hard to believe that they are the same producers of <UNK> women that did this mess br br tv review 1 star
<START> did anyone notice when miss <UNK> went skinny <UNK> she left the water wearing white bikini <UNK> and yet had previously taken it all off to join cabin boy this could have been a good film without miss brooks phony accent and a year on the island please how come that kelly looked always clean and ready for a <UNK> photo shoot what started out with premise turned in to soft porn and billy zane come on you cant be that hard up for film offers check out dead calm also when the people took her away how come she <UNK> her face and after all that time didn't feel like throwing up i suggest billy find decent scripts kelly stick to photo shoots and cabin boy play the son of zorro in a future sequel
<START> wow what an overrated movie this turned out to be it was supposed to be an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed killer holding a woman hostage and in terror in her home well i doubt it <UNK> audiences in the early <UNK> and i know it would put today's audiences asleep br br sends <UNK> down the spine <UNK> the new york times no the only <UNK> i get is that anyone is left on the planet who believes anything the n y times <UNK> about anything br br well it was about a deranged man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man howard <UNK> robert ryan was actually harmless and friendly in fact this was one of the <UNK> roles ryan ever played yes <UNK> was nuts but he never <UNK> the woman and only wanted a friend to trust br br the film even turned boring after awhile with very little going on except a lot of <UNK> br br beware my reader this sucks
<START> if you're going to spoof james bond it's a brilliant idea to find a leading man who resembles both sean connery and leonard so step forward jean who captures perfectly the connery <UNK> that <UNK> as a smile plus the self <UNK> of thinking he is suave plays it like a <UNK> who can hold his own at karate the plot has him looking for our man in who has disappeared mysteriously and includes such <UNK> as a nazi cell <UNK> inside a <UNK> if there is a jarring note it is the leading lady who has all the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> and is <UNK> but only just by it's good for one viewing but that's about it
<START> this is a must for all but especially african americans it is about time there is a movie that expresses and shows the concerns going on in african american relationships it also allows other cultures to see in a fictional humorous manner how positive african american relationships are and the <UNK> of them instead of the <UNK> stereotype that <UNK> the african american community i love this film a must see
<START> though i saw this movie dubbed in french so i'm sure it lost something in the translation lack of accents etc it was an excellent fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room a real pick me up that portrayed accurately and positively the <UNK> of individual sexuality gender role and finding a place within the <UNK> to which one is supposed to belong male gay urban 30 ish etc i was very proud of french television for showing such an honest and positive portrayal of the gay community while the fact that the gay lead character ends up somewhat straight in the end is mildly disappointing that's life and that happens sometimes this is a great movie whether alone or with a date a really enjoyable experience
<START> michael played by steven robertson has <UNK> and lives a quiet and dull life in <UNK> home when a newcomer to the home <UNK> <UNK> befriends him he proceeds to show michael how to live past the <UNK> despite or maybe because of <UNK> <UNK> unable to move all but his head and a few <UNK> on his hand <UNK> is <UNK> independent and extremely rebellious his affect upon the quiet and <UNK> michael is spectacular and the two soon leave the care home to set up lives in the outside world where they <UNK> the help of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a care assistant br br this film is one of the gems of the year much like last year's in america the film goes from being extremely funny to <UNK> touching <UNK> and truly moving without once seeming <UNK> sweet knowing exactly where to <UNK> at the <UNK> and where to simply let the story and characters do their thing <UNK> has crafted a wonderful film which tells us all to look past the surface and see what lies within br br the true strengths of the film come in the lead actors so convincing are their characters that you truly do believe that they are disabled to further manage to convey humor and sorrow on top of the already great performances is amazing the pair really seem close friends and as their tale unfolds you care completely for them br br this is definitely one of the finest examples of film this year telling a very relevant story in a simple way if this film fails to touch your heart then you must contain pure ice inside
<START> wow this movie really sucked down below the normal scale of dull boring and unimaginative films i've seen recently the acting was poor and robotic the story was so bland you could have summed it up with a simple 5 minute short audio was so poor and dirty it was hard to even listen to perhaps it was <UNK> from the camera it was shot off of i'm not sure which movie the 3 glowing reviewers were commenting on but it wasn't this one perhaps the director had his hand in seeing that his film received a good review at least before the real reviews started to show up br br save your time or you'll just be wasting your time and money on this film absolute <UNK>
<START> matt is a loyal communist in a <UNK> steel mill who works to <UNK> workers into the party even though this <UNK> himself from his son family and neighbors what makes this even more difficult is that is actually an fbi agent posing as a communist in order to obtain information about party activities the party is trying to create a strike at the mill <UNK> the pro strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda also has to <UNK> with beautiful eve a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that is a double agent when eve learns the ugly truth about the <UNK> real motives the <UNK> decide she must be <UNK> and must aid her without <UNK> himself the film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but by today's standards very cheesy propaganda and little action or thrills <UNK> is very good in the main role but even he and the rest of the cast seem <UNK> few surprises here and how did this film receive a oscar nod for best documentary rating 4
<START> terror is saved from a <UNK> by the presence of canadian <UNK> simmons as the heroine she is a delight to watch from the front back and side otherwise what you have here is your standard monster movie playing like a low budget <UNK> version of the <UNK> john rhys davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported and the very monster is simply a man in a suit he does commit about 100 senseless gory killings at least so the body count in this one is pretty awesome formulaic to say the least i love the moment when simmons <UNK> tells someone what stands for goat eater scary
<START> house calls is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as how they used to make them it stars walter matthau in one of his best roles as a recently widowed doctor who goes out on the dating scene again and hits <UNK> as he seems to have a different woman every night he then meets hospital patient glenda jackson and soon develops a relationship with her but it's one that will be severely tested as she informs him she is a one man woman and expects him to be a one woman man br br this is a sweet very funny film also starring art <UNK> as the <UNK> hospital <UNK> and richard benjamin as <UNK> friend and fellow doctor it's a must see for any matthau fan or any fan of light comedy br br you won't be disappointed
<START> this film very succeed in the film festival in <UNK> czech <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> s based on a very good book excellent actors good camera the best director and <UNK> it was probably the most black comedy i've seen br br i really do recommend it to you
<START> most of this political thriller presented as a mostly run of the mill movie with a somewhat better development of many of the major characters that was much appreciated until the big twist and powerful climax that <UNK> twists experienced in silence of the <UNK> or the sixth sense reese <UNK> as the <UNK> wife of the missing egyptian husband and as the strong armed <UNK> offer strong performances jake <UNK> unfortunately is handed a more two dimensional character and has to <UNK> with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn cia <UNK> that has been presented many times before in other movies early on there is the nice scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of saving private ryan the silent scene that was used so effectively in <UNK> one consequence of violence the script also provides a little more glimpse into the mind set of the enemy but still doesn't allow the audience really much understanding again <UNK> the audience to <UNK> in stereotypical characterization the cinematography and photography also is somewhat of a letdown because unlike <UNK> or <UNK> down the crisp raw visceral presentation is missing not allowing the audience to really be there in the movie there is some distance that keeps the audience from realizing the intensity of the emotions occurring on the screen however overall the movie <UNK> itself by the end offering the audience a <UNK> look into the complexity of the united <UNK> use of rendition and the possible complications and consequences that may occur through its use eight out of ten stars
<START> <UNK> <UNK> inspired portrayal of miss <UNK> drag it is one of the great comedy characters in film equally wonderful is <UNK> character ruby gates br br this is a movie you should <UNK> up on the <UNK> with on a wet <UNK> afternoon and be transported to a time long ago when terrifying <UNK> school girls only gained our respect not our <UNK> i hear that a remake is in the <UNK> with rupert everett as miss he will have a hard job competing with the master or should that be mistress <UNK> <UNK> br br go and rent it it beats so much of what today goes for comedy
<START> i gotta go with my boy allen who also reviewed this film zombie <UNK> as my copy is entitled guess they left out the ninja part after realizing there isn't a single ninja nor reference to ninjas anywhere in the whole f <UNK> film is a total wasted of time honestly one of the most boring retarded films i've ever had the <UNK> of viewing br br a hooker is repeatedly un <UNK> raped by two zombies and then by a cop again un <UNK> when the cop doesn't believe her story she meets a guy who was beaten up by said zombies and the two try to find a way to seek vengeance on the undead <UNK> br br first off there is no or really other <UNK> at all to be had in zombie ninja <UNK> i was hoping to at least get some sort of horror porn hybrid a la porn of the dead or re <UNK> or perhaps perverted stories but no there was absolutely no sex in this film at least a bit <UNK> the ol' in out might have redeemed this boring garbage to some degree but without it we get a bunch of poorly shot scenes of complete boredom with zero payoff i'm all for trash films and most other schlock gore porn and exploit material but this one honestly sucks in every <UNK> way save your time pass this one up 1 10 and the one is only for a few brief shots of some sub par <UNK>
<START> what an awful adaptation the worst part was the music <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> playing in a story set in the early <UNK> the only character that didn't bore me to sleep was robert hardy i had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one and i love jane austen movies usually i didn't even rent it i borrowed it from the library they should have paid me to take it i don't quite understand how catherine and henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another <UNK> and her brother were way overdone it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the bad guys and part of the excitement of jane austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good isn't this is probably on my list of the ten worst movies i've seen
<START> while <UNK> susan harrison the <UNK> in reference to a bonanza episode i was reminded of this gem br br this episode is the inspiration for <UNK> all along the watch tower <UNK> cover is probably as well know and is one of his best which is one of his best br br thus this episode is responsible for several not bad for approximately 22 minutes of television br br but this is the twilight zone further comment of the series is unnecessary br br characters' is typical <UNK> intense dramatic <UNK> toward an end that is as inevitable in <UNK> as it is surprising the first time you see it br br this episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for any who have not seen it br br but you will feel <UNK> and you will never listen to <UNK> with the same ears again
<START> now i have seen two movies by the director <UNK> <UNK> a very good one farewell my <UNK> and this bad one the assassin both movies depict crucial events in chinese history <UNK> in the 20th century and <UNK> the first <UNK> of the whole chinese nation in the 3rd century <UNK> <UNK> with memorable characters gorgeous cinematography convincing sets good acting and an interesting story the assassin fails on nearly every level okay the sets are great the cinematography is good and the few battle scenes are quite exciting but the pathos call me a <UNK> but too much is too much if you felt that saving private ryan was too pathetic be aware this here will make you sick the dialogue is lifeless many lines seem like political statements subtle or entertaining is this <UNK> not the film is <UNK> by its own i am really surprised that the assassin gets such high votes here on imdb 4 10
<START> actually i'll admit i'm a political <UNK> so this <UNK> with me but the <UNK> nature of ms green yes i know what they did to her but the ending was such a <UNK> and totally inconsistent with the film itself br br why can't barry l and crew just left us wondering what he was going to do let us debate it br br instead they have this oh i'm not worthy <UNK> ending and it just shows that when the <UNK> were down it's better to leave the table instead of <UNK> down stop the disney ending and putting a bow on it life isn't easy they should have had the courage to give the main character some <UNK> br br we had to listen to the <UNK> the entire movie and then it turned <UNK> and the stupid inane behavior by ms green when the crap was out of her system just made for a ridiculous near end of the movie that was <UNK> on the cake
<START> this film is boring boring boring boring and boring it's not the worse film i ever saw on the contrary but how shall i put this it's boring there is some very nice scenery and some clever dry wit but that's about it if it was advertised as a <UNK> i would rate it a 7 but it's supposed to be a film with a plot some drama and for god's sake a point or a satisfying conclusion br br i read some of the comments on this board about this films and i wondered if they saw the same movie as i did br br see this film yawn at your own risk one thing for sure it really is rated correctly g rating which most stand for god awful boring
<START> spoiler but probably not br br the game is called <UNK> kong but <UNK> kong is not even in it br br anymore <UNK> is gone <UNK> br br the 1st <UNK> kong country was one of my two all time favorite br br super <UNK> games the other being super mario world br br the 2nd <UNK> kong at least had <UNK> kong and good levels br br although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times br br however this one is the worst of the lot it does not have the feel of br br the original or 2nd the <UNK> look stupid and the levels are br br even worse it does not look realistic anymore i did not enjoy his game unlike the last two the first had great br br background music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in this br br game is horrible br br it happens a lot these days that movies shows and sometimes br br video games that start out fantastic end up with it being ruined by br br a stupid sequel i am sad to say i feel that <UNK> kong as a saga is not as good br br now that it has <UNK> kong 3 br br they should have left it at the original or maybe the 2nd one
<START> i <UNK> some time ago to never get another joe castro film perhaps after near death but i sort of ended up with this one by accident since it was a troma release i didn't read the cover carefully <UNK> well i watched it and it's by no means good but it's i guess sort of tongue in cheek if it's not it sure seemed that way some <UNK> folks from the university of the <UNK> <UNK> set out to find if the exists because of <UNK> camera footage from someone's goat <UNK> that shows this weird thing <UNK> across the field of vision and also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition there's a couple of camera men one of whom <UNK> the whole time and there some ex marine named army who is some kind of <UNK> expert or something at any rate the do find the on some guy's ranch set out to find it getting involved with two supposed witches along the way the creature itself is rather ridiculous looking with <UNK> on its back a great big long tongue that gene simmons would die for eventually after a bunch of folks done get killed so does the and they take it back to the university for an <UNK> so is it from another planet is it a genetic creation from some lab in puerto rico uh they don't tell us really not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either definitely not a wide audience for this one 4 out of 10
<START> at the beginning it was almost a shock to see norma <UNK> without her makeup then she <UNK> herself and becomes the life of the party br br anyway she <UNK> her husband makes herself over and gets on with her life or so she thinks somewhat keeps you guessing if they'll get back together
<START> they missed up the film when the tried to use some one they should of <UNK> ralph <UNK> as danny instead of changing it and made more karate kids with him in it and also many people were what happen to danny when they jumped from 3 to 5 and no four
<START> <UNK> morgana is an absolute masterpiece it's <UNK> <UNK> most unconventional film it doesn't have a plot or story instead of a story we're given a collection of images words and music that work so wonderfully together it's not a documentary either some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read it has some of the most beautiful and haunting images <UNK> shoots real <UNK> and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror the use of music in this movie is so brilliant from leonard cohen <UNK> and the third ear band imagine stanley kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey in the desert that's what this movie is like this film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as though your spirit has left your body a must see it will change the way you view films rating 10 out of 10

<START> the only reason i know this film exists is because i wanted to see what nancy had been up to since the facts of life ended when i searched her name up came this relatively new tv movie after much investigation i managed to locate a copy was thoroughly disappointed with what i viewed d grade acting poor script terrible fx it was like watching a toned down more <UNK> version of day after tomorrow that went for 3 hours despite the long running time the characters remain fairly under developed we do not care about them in the slightest in most cases are longing for their demise combine that with terrible lighting cinematography you have a real disaster of a film how they con so many name actors i e <UNK> randy quaid brian <UNK> to appear in such trash is mind blowing in summary i want those 3 hours of my life back
<START> this movie made me watch paul w s <UNK> and enjoy it i am not even going to dream of comparing <UNK> to any of the alien or predator <UNK> movies this is a horrible teenage b horror footage set in an american small town no one cares about br br at least had <UNK> of <UNK> art <UNK> into the movie sets it had <UNK> of eye candy not previously seen in any of the original movies but was ruined by unconvincing characters acting br br <UNK> takes bad acting to the lowest imaginable level and it also lacks in every other department just as much it's a <UNK> to include alien and predator suits in this kind of rubbish
<START> not good mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people some comments 1 i am tired of seeing <UNK> who never talk to their <UNK> never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said <UNK> who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds says something 2 fine so <UNK> has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her <UNK> but charles is completely different in all aspects from her father if anything henry is much closer as a sensual <UNK> person 3 how could you ever believe that she would be more attracted to tom <UNK> than to rhys meyer 4 hard to believe if she had been in fact raised as a deeply religious girl that she would be so <UNK> about sleeping with a <UNK> after knowing him for 5 minutes br br some good things about the film at least she didn't end up pregnant not knowing who the father was the whole description of life in the jewish community in london is good
<START> yes this review may contain spoilers but you'll thank me for it this is the worst film i've seen in quite some time i came to this board expecting to see the same response i had but inexplicably there are several people who love this film and <UNK> performance in particular br br some will <UNK> me for saying it but i find kevin <UNK> acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him i felt like i was watching a <UNK> version of <UNK> american beauty role his character in this film is ridiculously <UNK> all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant br br there are all world trite and boring scenes like when spacey is <UNK> into <UNK> about bringing him equal instead of sweat and low somehow i suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny but by this time i was ready to hit the stop button this is approximately 20 minutes into the film br br what about the faux homage to dogs <UNK> <UNK> i think i saw this in a movie once as if he's going to cut off <UNK> ear but what does he use to cut him an <UNK> that's right he's going to give him paper cuts that has to be one of hollywood's all time worst scenes and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling br br i will admit that i didn't see the end of this film my dvd mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that i missed a great twist and everything would have made sense well i don't care what happened in the end because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over the top dialogue i even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as i did
<START> i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information score 6 7 well not so bad genre scifi good i like scifi so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it but but no br br as in summary this isn't a movie at all it is a religious <UNK> including about jesus god devil end of the world etc movie starts with a epic <UNK> story driving at night car stops bright light and so on well actually that was the film last of this <UNK> frankly i don't know what to call it was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement quite a same stuff what these tv tell you but they are good at it br br honestly if you <UNK> to see a scifi movie or something with <UNK> please stay far away from this thing it has nothing to do with them if you want to hear some <UNK> <UNK> opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do then go ahead and watch this thing but i still prefer going to the church at sunday br br this is complete bull and <UNK> christian propaganda as another users said well i should have red another users comments before i got the movie br br 27 of voters have rated this thing as 10 yeah right please go somewhere else to do your propaganda
<START> the movie was very good when it came out i attended <UNK> high and <UNK> upper grade center around 1968 i was also home coming queen and grew up and lived in the area of <UNK> i knew a lots of people in the movie it was nice to see friends in the movie that lived in the area also and they had a chance to be a star that may have been a once in a life time experience for them i had good times growing up on the north side and tough times i can relate to the movie <UNK> high is no longer standing but a person like myself and others still remember the fun we had growing up attending <UNK> high there is a lot of history around this north side area to be told
<START> this film is the most romantic in years david duchovny is superb make you cry smile and dream <UNK> driver and james belushi are very good too but david is <UNK> <UNK> miss the opportunity to see this little film and fall in love with bob and grace run <UNK> walk
<START> <UNK> peterson directs this thriller that has clint eastwood playing service agent frank who matches wits with a clever psycho john <UNK> in a cat and mouse game involving the the protection of the president mitch <UNK> <UNK> keeps in touch with <UNK> the agent with <UNK> remarks about his abilities as well as the secret <UNK> protection of the <UNK> in the past agent <UNK> raines <UNK> russo tries to keep grounded but he is head strong in stopping <UNK> from carrying out his <UNK> of assassination very good fx and fast pace <UNK> the plot eastwood and <UNK> are superb russo has a way of getting your attention <UNK> out this strong cast are dylan mcdermott fred dalton thompson john <UNK> and gary cole
<START> if you like silly comedies like airplane you'll love this movie it's definitely in the style of airplane and scary movie a fun film it has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie michael jackson <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stuart <UNK> charlie and eric roberts the special effects are hokey but i think they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy there is apparently two versions of the film one at blockbuster and one on the official website com the one on the website appears to be a preview release version signed by the director there's some fun behind the scenes material filmed at <UNK> with michael jackson as well the movie was filmed in 2003 and says it's pg rated fun on the box
<START> this movie is so mild i tried not to expect anything greater from this film but still it was a big disappointment the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential this could have been so much better the characters are really simple no depth at all it's a shame that previously talented performers and didn't make the already poor characters any better the director just don't get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of <UNK> p br br and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie that's hideous br br why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situation br br it's too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it oh no
<START> the interaction between portman and sarandon was quite interesting and i was really sold on the mother daughter relationship it is a family story that isn't <UNK> down by <UNK> and special effects a story of how it really is i couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends the acting was quite exquisite and i hope we'll be seeing both portman and sarandon in familiar roles down the road
<START> in a time of bad if not plain awful comedies king of queens is more than just a breath of fresh air it's a complete <UNK> tank it is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times nothing has been this good since married with children kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses and believe me it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius these guys truly understand what is funny i could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing just once other funny people in this show are carrie janet <UNK> and doug <UNK> boss i'm so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem the show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers check it out if you haven't
<START> i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites it has all the charm 1940's <UNK> and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious to boot barbara <UNK> plays an independent single woman who writes cooking home life <UNK> for a famous magazine under the premise that she is a married <UNK> even the president of the magazine is under this <UNK> enter a handsome <UNK> played by the talented dennis morgan just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy his simple wish is to stay at the <UNK> <UNK> the she writes so <UNK> about and relax with her famous home <UNK> <UNK> she now has to <UNK> find a way to save her job and reputation add to this that her fiancé is in a hurry to tie the <UNK> doesn't help the humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun throw in the character actor <UNK> <UNK> who fits this name completely it becomes even more adorable this has become my must see movie that i <UNK> in with a cup of <UNK> each christmas season a wonderful enjoyable movie to enjoy at <UNK> or anytime
<START> as a bruce campbell fan for nearly two decades i was thrilled to have an opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in <UNK> unfortunately man with the screaming brain was itself a disappointment br br set in <UNK> where the sci fi channel makes its saturday night original films man with the screaming brain is a curious mix of <UNK> b movie horror body switching comedy violent revenge flick and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic <UNK> if that doesn't make sense well neither does man with the screaming brain campbell plays a <UNK> company <UNK> who visits <UNK> with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to <UNK> in the former communist country's half finished subway system the two fall in with a former <UNK> agent turned cab driver and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman br br a local scientist <UNK> <UNK> and his goofy assistant ted <UNK> who have developed a technique to allow <UNK> <UNK> without the possibility of <UNK> steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab <UNK> brain into <UNK> damaged skull also they put his wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand br br campbell escapes and with a <UNK> skull and the voice of the cab driver whose <UNK> brain <UNK> controls the left side of his body <UNK> in his head sets off to find and kill the gypsy his robot wife does the same br br but first there's an attempt to <UNK> steve martin lily all of me when <UNK> two personalities battle for <UNK> over a restaurant dinner just as he was playing his own evil hand in evil dead ii campbell is <UNK> at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind br br at times screaming comes closest to another steve martin film the man with two brains as it also takes a silly approach to <UNK> sci fi clichés however it tries too hard for too little result and that goes double for ted <UNK> semi <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who gets entirely too much screen time nothing against <UNK> it's just that he's better in smaller doses br br in the end it's neither outrageous or funny enough to satisfy as a spoof nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a b movie <UNK> i was glad that campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt as i feared having to say gee bruce that was really something br br perhaps the best praise i can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the <UNK> and it was twice as good as alien apocalypse
<START> i originally saw this movie as a blockbuster vhs rental that was quite some time ago but still remembered it blockbuster doesn't have it anymore netflix didn't have it and there weren't many copies on the web only a few vhs copies recently did finally find it available in dvd form on ebay for a reasonable price in pal format but our dvd player will play pal <UNK> on our <UNK> tv br br wife and i both enjoyed it the style of the movie is a bit strong and many if not most of the parts are rather strongly over played as if amateurs were making it especially the kids but it's not <UNK> the <UNK> of societies are <UNK> in the <UNK> br br there is a bit of political preaching in terms of saying that the young in russia shouldn't try to escape their not so great life but instead should at least try to make things better first but that's not <UNK> it's fairly humorous most of the time br br some <UNK> of the west commented upon by others isn't that at all imo i take it as a comment about expectations of the russian characters at least when taken from my western viewpoint perhaps it's a <UNK> of the west from a russian viewpoint which it is literally by the characters saying it br br i can't say how literally true to the film the english subtitles are but i can say that the subtitles were done very well full of english <UNK> as if done by a native english <UNK> complete with colorful language
<START> i must say this is the best movie i have ever seen i know that on this website it's received only negative reviews but for once i'd like to be the good person who gives the worlds best movie a good review i find the movie to be extremely funny and it has the perfect mix of everything it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when i watch it and i can't get enough of it the <UNK> brilliant i love it i understand why people may not love it as much as i do but i don't understand how people could hate it the movie is 100 brilliance <UNK> is amazing i never realised that aussie movies could be so good and i also never realised i could watch one movie so many times in a single day without getting sick of it i think that everybody should watch it whether its to get a feel of what life was like in the younger days or if its to see what your in for when you reach the end of year 12
<START> this was such a funny movie which was soon forgotten about probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies such as this the movie is not quit as predictable as one would think crawl is an unattractive but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend still an unlikely match for rebecca who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home when he helps feel more at ease at school by showing her around the neighborhood and <UNK> her to <UNK> more they become buddies but it is completely <UNK> when she realizes her boyfriend might <UNK> she does not feel ready he seems to like her boyfriend but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility you kind of learn what a good friend crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married when her boyfriend <UNK> to her in front of the whole family she kicks crawl and puts him on the spot he tells the whole family that he <UNK> to her and gives her his diamond ring which it out was his the whole time he must have come from money or something well they never really show a close up of the ring the message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him <UNK> boyfriend who her parents love turned mean when we find out he his new girlfriend after rebecca <UNK> and crawl so that rebecca would have broken up with crawl thinking they were a couple although they were not rebecca was mad at him which when you think about it was kind of unfair since they were not a couple but i think they were starting to like one another and i think she thought there was more the movie never showed them actually become a couple they left it open for the viewers to decide they never even actually <UNK> at any point although there was one part where they almost did that was one thing most viewers seemed to <UNK> many people saw it and said that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock but they were just friends the whole time even towards the end and she did not introduce him as her boyfriend still they never told her parents they were not engaged rebecca almost did even if he would never become her boyfriend they could have still been friends in the 90s for some reason men were in and there was this big <UNK> type that woman liked men not that there is anything wrong with that think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type which crawl proved to be through his friendship with rebecca but when i saw the movie i must admit if i went for looks i thought i would have gone for the first boyfriend still it was a creative movie that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others
<START> this could have been better but it was alright it helped me get away from my boredom i didnt even wanna see it the only reason i wanted to rent it is because jamie is in it he is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the movie the ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b movie i give it a 4 out of 10
<START> this is one of the great movies of all time the story is fascinating and the actors are convincing your really identify with the characters william <UNK> <UNK> with this movie that he is a great director his <UNK> is <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> in the line of fire is cunning and occasionally a truly white <UNK> ride even if once or twice we might feel like we've been down similar roads before how could one not when clint eastwood right after allegedly closing the book on his western legacy likely <UNK> the one on his gritty detective pictures don't count blood work in there but there's more than that because eastwood's character here a hard bitten demon ridden and hard as nails secret service agent has a slightly charming side to him even the more romantic side that one never got to see in the pictures where he <UNK> his trademark lines there is some <UNK> going on here that don't rely on just the usual <UNK> and it's note worthy for how such a possibly contrived back story didn't save kennedy from being <UNK> in <UNK> is made somewhat believable amidst the rest of his persona which more than likely hides his wounds most of the time eastwood goes to town to make himself a great presence in the film however and under the circumstances the character seems <UNK> made for him br br but there would be the risk of his part in the movie being slightly conventional we still get the <UNK> type scenes of him being smarter and as smart ass over everyone else in the room and being <UNK> and told to back off by the top <UNK> here a chief of staff including here protecting a president that wisely we never really see or know at all even the romantic sub plot which is sort of <UNK> if there for some <UNK> laughs would make the picture a little sub par if the other quasi dirty harry aspect didn't come into the picture an <UNK> villain this time there's some extra hollywood suspense however intelligent suspense almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves with the john booth character played in an oscar nominated performance by john <UNK> as someone who's described more as a predator than an assassin there's ways this could go wrong with the eastwood character but <UNK> possibly <UNK> some of his former villain counterparts by being extremely cool and un <UNK> there's that devastating cringe worthy scene where he kills the bank <UNK> and her roommate and as his past is revealed there's still that element of <UNK> the hell is with this <UNK> that keeps the audience and eastwood's agent guessing and extra paranoid it's a classic <UNK> performance <UNK> creepy and always <UNK> in the level of insanity and <UNK> br br it's also aside from the conventional points just a <UNK> made picture from peterson and company and they come pretty close to the <UNK> pulp realism of don <UNK> but peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his <UNK> that had me <UNK> at times anytime someone puts in such a blatant but exciting homage to vertigo jumping from <UNK> to <UNK> hero <UNK> from the <UNK> the <UNK> it still provides some <UNK> down my spine there's also the phone conversations between eastwood and <UNK> where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game probably another kick in the <UNK> to but in the end even with all the excitement and brutal danger and crisp <UNK> in the climax it's also a characters picture in some ways throughout and everything is fairly realized to give the audience a fine amount to <UNK> over at least in the suspense movie sense a great lead russo plays the female possible love interest sincere and mature and <UNK> is top of the pops there's also a few notable supporting roles too and a fine studio score in there one of the better films of 1993
<START> this film <UNK> <UNK> into the realm of the surreal <UNK> la lynch and <UNK> with an atmosphere that is strangely compelling <UNK> the viewer with the dream like intensity of its images br br the narration is to be <UNK> the narrator being trapped behind a painting <UNK> to the bed who often speaks for it <UNK> its desires and reasoning yes <UNK> would sound like that br br there are some flaws but its strengths <UNK> its weaknesses the sequence with the woman wrenching herself out of the bed and <UNK> across the floor trying to escape will leave you breathless br br the film possesses a <UNK> de <UNK> air about it and should be read as a <UNK> cry from the <UNK> of the 20th century br br find this film and <UNK> in it
<START> six months after high school laura dies during a race a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons that's the <UNK> plot of early 80s slasher <UNK> day a <UNK> addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style originality or decent gore br br what it does deliver however are some stunningly awful musical <UNK> a few familiar faces including an early appearance from scream queen <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> of nudity a <UNK> of any slasher movie br br so forget the death lame and rather instead enjoy the movie's more <UNK> crap elements the rapid editing that can <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the roller disco which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song ' gangster <UNK> as performed by the <UNK> awful an <UNK> <UNK> session by the <UNK> students christopher george <UNK> it up as chief red <UNK> coach michaels and the cheesy music teacher who after his female students who for some reason find him quite irresistible br br towards the end of the film the action picks up a little with the discovery of the slaughtered kids' bodies under the <UNK> and a quite twisted scene featuring <UNK> corpse in her cap and <UNK> but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity
<START> this is a great late night movie what i mean by that is that i truly have enjoyed playing my 3 00 vhs copy now i have a 6 99 dvd copy many nights just before <UNK> or if i have insomnia there's just something about this movie that makes it fun to watch in repeated viewings it could be the fun that basil <UNK> has in the secret weapon wearing several <UNK> which fool the bad guys and <UNK> assistant <UNK> bruce watson but not the <UNK> mary gordon it could be the espionage code cracking and <UNK> ii theme it could even be the light touch which the director uses to handle the threatening situations holmes finds himself in while keeping the story moving whatever it is secret weapon is simply a pleasant and enjoyable detective story which takes us back to a time when the nazis were seeking world <UNK> and does it with the bonus of the <UNK> between watson and holmes whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and noble save the world themes of this movie or not i think they are right on i find that they only add to the flavor and fun of this fine old adventure film that holds up to repeated viewings i rate it a pleasant <UNK> 100 points
<START> we have a character named just wants to be a good person she's nice friendly smiles often but is strangely brutally honest also has a secret her idiot <UNK> sister has been <UNK> original poetry which is getting the community excited about the sister writing unfortunately it's poetry while their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in just tries to figure out what she really wants to do br br what to keep in mind while watching this movie is who really is for such a brutally honest person who doesn't mind telling <UNK> league types that she doesn't respect them it would seem odd that she would be able to pull off a lie for someone so happy and cheerful she's quite <UNK> when it comes to certain issues those aren't character flaws they're plot development and they mean a lot more than they at first seem br br mostly this is something of a melodrama a character lies the other characters' personalities <UNK> them through drama as relationships are held at risk but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiot <UNK> sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch br br the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good they're acceptable and world is <UNK> in color and light which makes for some very beautiful images but it's not very consistent it's not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters so while it isn't a perfect movie it's certainly an enjoyable one br br <UNK>
<START> i really enjoyed this movie in my dvd collection of baseball movies reminded me how great the sport truly is whether it's here in america or japan
<START> i was looking forward to seeing this movie unfortunately i should have listened to my daughters advice this should have been a spoof but it took on a realism that <UNK> had a lot to answer for br br jim carrey after all the work he has done is still jim carrey and his comedy does not get any better his co star was not able to back him up their son in the movie was invisible br br the life of crime was a blink and that was the missing link of the movie the film showed 2 or 3 <UNK> and they were <UNK> than before that where it lost it for me br br i did laugh in some parts the whole not good enough i felt was there to add some weight to the film his character was not strong enough there were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie
<START> this movie was disturbing not because of the subject matter but because of the way it was handled the extremely overweight mother angela did not even make it on the cover of the video case when most of the rest of the cast did this is not fair but is a statement in itself i also notice her picture is missing from imdb maybe her own choice and it looks like this is her only film ever the language in this movie was crude beyond necessity watched with my <UNK> old son because it was rated pg in canada and the language coming out of their mouths was shameful disgusting never did appreciate shirley like so many others seem to br br love kathy bates and always will part was annoying br br the little boy alex is a great little actor i'll have to see what else he's been up to lately
<START> this film tops the previous incarnation by a mile taking everything to the next level as always the jackass guys are purely unbelievable and i personally laughed harder in that theatre than i have in a long time like the first jackass this isn't so much a movie as an <UNK> minute long string of stunts and pranks it is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level essentially these guys are <UNK> themselves for the amusement of others and its great the <UNK> are so low outrageous and often disgusting that they <UNK> into a higher form of entertainment br br you can't rate this along other movies its in a class of its own and it shines go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is
<START> this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it is about true love and friendship about turning your life around and doing something good for someone else thomas bo <UNK> may play the same role he has done in so many other movies but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too but so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies  he's perfect for that role <UNK> <UNK> does a great job too these two criminal low <UNK> are the best friends ever they share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the costs are when they find out that <UNK> daughter is being abused they put everything on hold things you can't put on hold unless you have to make even more criminal acts and takes her to a better place they do the best they can  these two men are not <UNK> but they have their heart in the right place all i can say is that peter and are my biggest heroes <UNK>
<START> well don't expect anything deep an meaningful most of the fight scenes are pretty decent the two leading ladies are quite endearing but their lack of hk action background shows at times the ending maybe lacks something but i quite enjoyed it none the less the cheesy humour isn't probably going to appeal to anyone who hasn't watched a bunch of hk films but if your down with that sort of thing and have a couple of hours to fill with something meaningless you could do a lot worse than this ok so you could do better but br br certainly on a par with most of the hollywood blockbuster action drivel br br 7 10
<START> great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line wesley is <UNK> good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful the girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with
<START> this movie obviously had good intentions at the end there is a dedication to someone named <UNK> who as a viewer i can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts perhaps she made the wrong choice that dedication is the only redeeming quality of love suicide br br the movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film it's pretty much going to be downhill after that which it was i know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good unfortunately everything else was horrid the acting the plot the sound quality the picture quality the acting i'm sorry but the acting is horrible beyond horrible it's as if the actors are trying to act like people acting that's the only way i can think to describe it as i watched i actually <UNK> the script with the stage direction in my mind none of the movements were natural and none of the characters' reactions to one another fit in short the timing is way off the timing of the entire film is way off i'm no director so i know the limits of my knowledge but i really feel there had to be some way to convey the passing of time until they explained about <UNK> not being too far away i was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a week a month at most br br all that being said it's really a shame this movie truly could have been powerful with a little <UNK> all the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the set up is obvious which is a bad thing the moving scenes totally fell flat for instance when <UNK> brother takes his hat of his head and puts it on hers we should feel the understanding he has for her the innocence and of the love of her brother somehow it just doesn't come off that way there are so many more scenes like this for example all of the fight scenes and all they do is take away from the movie all these things put together love suicide comes off as one long cheesy low budget commercial
<START> during wwii there were a <UNK> movies created by hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to seem alike however over 21 is unique in so many ways as it shows a side of the war you won't see in other films making it well worth seeing even if you have seen the <UNK> other films br br alexander knox plays the male lead but the real lead of the film is irene dunne who looks amazing for a <UNK> year old lady yes i checked she really was this old when she made the film in over 21 the pair play husband and wife he <UNK> in the military much to the <UNK> of his father charles coburn and owner of the newspaper where knox is employed and most of the film takes place when he is in officers candidate school the film shows little of knox in the school but instead centers on dunne as she lives in nearby <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> during this time she as the british say keeps a upper and makes the best of it even though she really isn't a housewife but a famous professional writer occasionally she gets very brief visits from her <UNK> husband but most of the time is spent doing housewife duties and keeping the <UNK> coburn at bay eventually she decides to stop the <UNK> coburn from <UNK> <UNK> he always complains that his paper won't survive without his son by pretending to be knox writing wonderful that everyone just assumes were written by him br br while there is nothing earth shaking in this film it's a very interesting slice of life move additionally the acting all around is very good it's interesting that this film is a <UNK> <UNK> of the experienced of ruth gordon a famous screenwriter and her husband <UNK> <UNK> also a famous screenwriter as well as director when <UNK> joined the military during wwii gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this film br br by the way i noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it while it was very good it was also very sad as all this hope for a better world following the war was short lived
<START> this was one of my favorite movies from childhood i watched it so many times eventually my tape wore out i was a huge fan of this show and still am the thing i love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people both young and old i watch this movie now and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw it i am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes that i never got as a child my favorite characters are and almost fifteen years later my dad a huge fan of the movie as well and i are still <UNK> lines from this movie i love the part where and shirley go to the movies you save the seats <UNK> and i'll <UNK> the <UNK> i also loved the storyline of <UNK> and <UNK> and his family going to happy world land <UNK> pig reminded me a lot of my dad i love the part when they finally get to happy world land and all they do is ride on the <UNK> this movie is hilarious and appeals to children and kids the animation jokes and everything about it are top notch if you have not seen it rent it you won't be sorry
<START> another nice entry in the crime doctor series 4 10 with atmospheric almost <UNK> black and white photography and some splendid spanish american backdrops and sets and a more off the wall storyline too br br a man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party the crime doctor is on the scene ostensibly as a guest to immediately and <UNK> <UNK> it murder and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to <UNK> over for one of them did the deed was it the <UNK> brother of the dead 1st wife the 3rd wife and rich widow <UNK> brooke the dancing brother and sister vampires the intense young man the eccentric <UNK> maker lloyd <UNK> on <UNK> from boston <UNK> the <UNK> butler or odds on <UNK> <UNK> police inspector <UNK> <UNK> had his work cut out but warner <UNK> as was as <UNK> as ever in working it all out one of the goofs listed on the imdb is wrong on breaking into the murder room says right through the centre of the <UNK> and <UNK> replies he didn't miss this time favorite bits <UNK> and <UNK> travelling through club <UNK> and beer at the nightclub to make <UNK> for their interrupted dinner party the scene where the place of <UNK> is seemingly <UNK> the plot does seem to <UNK> a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of <UNK> but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldn't do either br br well worth a watch if you already like the genre you won't be disappointed unless you really don't like the genre
<START> spoiler warning br br i got this <UNK> on dvd at christmas 2004 i had <UNK> to see it and was by no means disappointed the score is memorable my br br favourites were the theme song and the winters coming song the effects were dazzling you could almost believe they were there you actually learn something too may have been able to <UNK> their <UNK> with blood female t <UNK> might have gone on a killing spree before laying their eggs i know there's a lot of people who thought this was based too much on <UNK> but there will always be questions that we can only guess at and there is a lot of hard core <UNK> fact as well we know that some dinosaurs <UNK> in <UNK> we know that <UNK> stones to <UNK> up <UNK> in their <UNK> despite this <UNK> the series did extremely well so well in fact that it <UNK> a <UNK> a prequel and several <UNK> if you're a <UNK> fan then this is for you it makes jurassic park look small and <UNK>
<START> anna success <UNK> head <UNK> now begins to look like it <UNK> totally on the script and alex <UNK> great lead performance the degree to which this latest the book of revelation is both derivative pretentious and utterly unoriginal except for <UNK> fine cinematography seems to bear this out br br alas there have already been quite a few aussie movies dealing with such themes some <UNK> for and or explicit sex scenes in the 1970s and 1980s and beyond and maybe they're worth looking at again after this piece of fluff of course setting the whole thing in the world of ballet and making it all <UNK> slow and in its choreography like a 1960s dutch ballet experimental number does suggest great art if you've not traveled around much and then only if you never progressed beyond art theory 101 br br add to the <UNK> <UNK> arch dialog you will do as we command and the whole <UNK> falls onto its well <UNK> face then there are the bits straight from <UNK> <UNK> br br given the lovely but <UNK> performance by colin <UNK> how about a real city <UNK> thriller br br all in all with 'the book of the feminist project has been set back yet another decade and with the willing and deeply of male writers like henry miller william <UNK> even <UNK> collaboration of some collective in melbourne oz suffering from a form of educational and <UNK> <UNK> no revelations <UNK> us here
<START> i am so glad <UNK> was in 'the <UNK> life of <UNK> and because that is my favorite show and he is my favorite actor it is a really funny episode and a funny show i love everything about the show and the characters all of the performers are great keep on acting <UNK> and i am so happy that nearly all of my favorite actors including high school musical characters are in this show <UNK> is so <UNK> and i have an <UNK> picture of him it is not a photo copy and it came all the way from america to australia and it nearly did not arrive in time for christmas also i got a high school musical <UNK> with my name <UNK> on it scarlett 8
<START> seriously you've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it it came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy the little <UNK> mr <UNK> etc yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm every single character in the movie is driven by rage with the exception of mother who shows only <UNK> and <UNK> possibly at the tired <UNK> this movie enjoys br br to put it simply the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting nor the filming but most notably the writing the lines we receive are reminiscent of disney classics although this film lacks the whole <UNK> <UNK> walt managed to pull off <UNK> dad john ritter makes you mad without even doing anything simply because he allows junior to run around <UNK> and only gives him a stern warning when he tapes a 200 pound <UNK> to a <UNK> board br br also <UNK> grandfather is particularly excruciating for those of you who saw the first one found it nauseating and thus did not see the second one big ben <UNK> as he is referred to in this movie is still a total <UNK> he basically into john <UNK> house <UNK> <UNK> himself in <UNK> room even though he says that he hates junior and basically does nothing to <UNK> the film's speed or to support the film in any way rather he <UNK> off the audience by being a lazy free <UNK> br br finally we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters such as the smug obnoxious <UNK> who carries dynamite in her <UNK> which she first lights then hands to junior who simply stares wide eyed at also gilbert <UNK> returns in this film this time playing the obnoxious principal at <UNK> new <UNK> school if gilbert <UNK> ain't enough to get the point across i will put it simply this film <UNK> br br 2 10 stars because the actor's <UNK> shine through the film even though the script sucks
<START> if you are like me and observed the original <UNK> phenomenon from <UNK> finally seeing the movie for the first time 30 years later you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is and more <UNK> than ever about its popularity back in 1974 br br my judgment is not entirely objective as i tend to have a <UNK> bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack on the other hand i have always hated this particular dog a feature on the last couple seasons of <UNK> <UNK> never a great show the dog less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time br br <UNK> is an <UNK> minute mega dose of the dog following him on several daily <UNK> through the town of <UNK> texas if this sounds boring you would be advised to give <UNK> a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a <UNK> fan if there are still any out there br br unlike my dog skip monkey business or because of <UNK> the human actors in the cast are extremely weak big peter <UNK> plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame br br if one of your children of any age appears to be finding <UNK> entertaining you should consider cutting back on their <UNK> br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i went into this movie determined to like it i usually enjoy dramas like wall street <UNK> gary <UNK> ross <UNK> room etc i went into this movie thinking i would be on the edge of my seat plus i am a big pacino fan br br what a piece of garbage quite possibly the worst movie i have seen in five years this makes <UNK> <UNK> in any given sunday actually look good first half the movie is watching matthew <UNK> lift <UNK> ok we get it you are in shape matt we don't need to see every other scene with you <UNK> iron <UNK> br br secondly how many plot holes are in this movie why introduce the phone call from long lost dad and never address it again what was the point of his mom hanging up on him why even have her call to say he is sending her too much money what was the point of that the guy from puerto rico who lost 30 million also since sports <UNK> is illegal in ny and its acknowledged its illegal how can they possibly guarantee everyone's bet at the end br br this was simply a very poorly written script it had potential but it was devoid of a coherent plot i thought pacino learned his lesson about script selection after any given sunday but apparently not my gosh this is the same actor that starred in the godfather br br don't waste your money
<START> i got this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 dvds i knew nothing about the history of the series season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4 season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being beyond good and evil with an original air date of 7 december 1998 the other 4 episodes on season 2 were broadcast from december 1997 to 1998 so beyond good and evil looks like season 3 episode 1 except there are no more episodes in season 3 br br spoilers here the two main characters of the first 8 episodes dr <UNK> john hannah and dr angela <UNK> <UNK> turner are missing from this episode being replaced by dr dan <UNK> <UNK> parker and dr <UNK> <UNK> eva <UNK> i recognized <UNK> parker from the series the inspector <UNK> mysteries which began in 2001 so they were planning to have a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast br br it seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character <UNK> when the main character is gone from the series so they might have been planning a return of dr <UNK> but when that failed the series was canceled i have no inside information on this but i do see that both john hannah and <UNK> parker were involved in other projects in 1999 does anyone have any information on this
<START> i really enjoyed the film it was really cheesy at times they destroy the villain with hair but where are they <UNK> in it's a unique film though and i enjoyed the acting of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> hope i also enjoyed however you write it liking <UNK> <UNK> because she called him a <UNK> besides the acting the <UNK> and showing what happened on <UNK> and then <UNK> point of view was quite interesting i saw it twice and i'd see it again
<START> wow it's even better than i expected the best animated movie ever and it feels so good to hear roger <UNK> doing the voice of again i surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of but i suggest that you go to see the french version cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast did you know that roger <UNK> has played for nearly forty years i think he did a marvelous job and the song from <UNK> <UNK> at the end fits <UNK> good to the end credits the music is good the drawings are good the actors are wonderful in a word a masterpiece go to see it you will not regret this
<START> this documentary focuses on the happenings in <UNK> 2001 in swedish media the <UNK> where <UNK> as criminals that stood for <UNK> and violence this movie shows that there not actually they are intelligent <UNK> people that has something to say and says it by the force of <UNK> they believe in a better world a world where people can think and say what they want without being aimed at but are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic i think not br br this documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed capitalism and the future it might bring it is a great documentary that is not propaganda because it is not shown as what they say is right everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrong br br i have heard many people that <UNK> this a propaganda and <UNK> chooses not to view it i think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the <UNK> belief all you get is more facts to rely on for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a <UNK> window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think br br overall this movie freaked me out because you cannot really dismiss the facts that the few policemen that fought violence with violence did not get convicted or even <UNK> in custody even however the proof of them throwing <UNK> at the <UNK> march and in some cases beating people with even though they are lying on the street without making resistance where as good as it gets br br rating 8 10 very good but not best
<START> how on earth were these guys given <UNK> to make this movie the lack of script is one thing but the cinematography makes you want to <UNK> a hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing i am well aware that the actors are amateurs but it's of no <UNK> since the director might be the least talented one ever directing in sweden it would be a shame for the industry if he or any in the team for that matter is given money to make a film ever again this movie simply provides fuel to the argument that too many movies are made in sweden each year
<START> i though that it was hard if not impossible to watch and not because of the horrors it depicts but by the way they were depicted imagine what <UNK> <UNK> could have done with this true horror story what i object to is the idea the need to <UNK> which i <UNK> to is enough what about showing it to us with the power of powerful cinema i feel that the <UNK> of the filmmaker maybe even the <UNK> anger didn't allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view or if this was a cinematic point of view i mean a choice then i didn't like it at all i was more disturbed by the way the movie was shot than by the movie itself well <UNK> i'm sure but unfortunately that's not nearly enough
<START> i watched <UNK> a few years ago with my friend he hyped it up as a great funny film that is one of the best comedies ever i think he was on crack or something i just recently learned that this film was not released into theatres i can understand why perfectly br br the basic plot involves a group of guys who cheat on pretty much all of their <UNK> in school to get good <UNK> that is the main problem of this film is that the morals are all bad there are other teen comedy films where students do bad things but it is most often stuff that does not take place at school so i think that the concept of having a whole movie that basically has kids cheating on everything is pretty bad br br i did not like the characters in this film either the main character guy is a completely smug arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist actually i am not sure if you could say that there is a protagonist due to the fact that they all are cheating at school which is wrong the other supporting characters were not funny at all and basically the cast blows in this film br br this film has a bad message and even worse acting and characters there are other teen films that are way better than this film so you do not have to see this one and that is a good thing because i do not recommend this film at all
<START> it was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie the director <UNK> focus on the main subject without <UNK> into side plots the doctor's family or stories of the other hospital patients that are so typical of bollywood <UNK> line products he kept the narrative simple to comprehend and made sure all the actors are true to the characters that they are supposed to portray the <UNK> ways of the grandfather in the clinic the cold and <UNK> behavior of the surgeon the <UNK> of the social worker gave the movie a feel of <UNK> i am also glad that the director did not fall for the temptation of adding songs or special effects and <UNK> it to the level of <UNK> or <UNK> a couple of scenes toward the end of the movie such as the boy visiting other blind children and a blind <UNK> <UNK> and also the final scene where the boy at the sound of <UNK> and birds <UNK> are sure make your eyes misty br br many bollywood players do not realize that oscar <UNK> members value simplicity of the subject and <UNK> and <UNK> of the movie more than the <UNK> and <UNK> is certainly a better nomination than <UNK> which dealt with a subject that has already been beaten to death no mpaa member is willingly going to suffer through 4 hours of <UNK> drama and a lot of song and dance br br i look forward to more movies from director <UNK> in the future
<START> as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters <UNK> on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret <UNK> book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape <UNK> murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband <UNK> butler to <UNK> under the <UNK> of visiting extended family after coming to an <UNK> with <UNK> she agrees to leave and proceeds to <UNK> with her o'hara relatives in <UNK> eventually she <UNK> her cousin a passionate leader of the <UNK> to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett <UNK> out into the world of the english <UNK> and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been <UNK> by <UNK> time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of <UNK> until <UNK> comes along in a clichéd night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancé and <UNK> by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i <UNK> advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to <UNK> this decision
<START> it pains me to say this about an australian film but mr accident ranks with the worst of the worst films i have ever seen what's even more tragic is that it doesn't fit into the <UNK> so bad it's <UNK> category what <UNK> me the most about this film is the fairly large amount of money that has been away on a pointless unfunny underdeveloped inept screenplay dumb performances what are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> gore aka <UNK> doing in this trash <UNK> direction no plot and a general sense of <UNK> totally take away from the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth comedy ha do yourself a favour and stay away
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen as well as the worst that i will probably ever see i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously just be <UNK> br br this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it its just plain bad bad bad bad bad br br this movie is the equivalent to having a pet rock as your friend you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen unfortunately it never does at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into <UNK> gate completely <UNK> on this <UNK> no this is a disaster after watching this film you would swear george w bush had his hands all over the making of this film yes its that idiotic br br stay away unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time its probably how <UNK> gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe
<START> let's face it br br this movie is incredibly cliché as korean romance dramas and movies go first of all there's a pair of long lost siblings one of which falls in love with the other second there's a not so popular girl and two gorgeous popular guys who fall for and fight over her third one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease which eventually takes his life br br still i like this movie br br without the right actors this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel but because the actors fit the roles perfectly the movie is engrossing i honestly couldn't stop watching <UNK> <UNK> won despite his pretty face gives an awesome <UNK> performance not to mention lee <UNK> ah and jo han sun plus all the supporting actors br br i'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone
<START> ever notice how so many really bad films attract so many 10 10 votes not much of a <UNK> how that happens but this is not much of a film there are two ways of looking at it being given away in the mail on sunday br br 1 it's free so you can't complain about it to much 2 it's free so it can't be much good br br my vote is number 2 the free dvd in the sunday papers things is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away they're ones that have been out for ages and have made most of the money they'll ever make so it's a case of anything else is a bonus it's the last stop for old films not the first for new ones so you can guess how bad this must be to skip tv and dvd rental br br the plus points are that <UNK> jones does try hard and derek <UNK> is good as dickens the minus points are a longer list trying isn't the same as <UNK> for poor <UNK> and <UNK> other tramp character is <UNK> ham that's gone off the story is very weak the dickens story does not have anything to do with the film's murders and feels like another movie slapped onto the script to make people think it's a british dan brown without the religion the supporting cast are either there for the money vanessa redgrave must be really hard up or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers it is also very very long for what it is br br <UNK> taking his priceless dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs but that's it not funny and very not good even for free
<START> i have seen tons of trash in every language about every topic and of every trend of film making from every period every director and any kind of budget available that said i really have to <UNK> br br this is one of the three worst movies i have ever seen br br it's painfully bad it's pompous it's grim it's incomprehensible it's annoying it's a really bad mess it is a piece of you know what br br and what's more important it lacks a point and even if it had one the characters are so unreal and annoying that it's impossible to overlook the lack of <UNK> of the whole thing br br it's just weird for the sake of being weird br br i actually felt sick watching this trash the theater where i saw it lincoln center in new york was full when it started by the end of it half of the audience had walked out there was a q a <UNK> at the end but nobody stayed with the exception of about two <UNK> everybody else ran for the door myself included br br save 2 hours of your life it's probably one of the worst ever done br br if there is a movie theater in hell this movie will be playing 24 7 for eternity
<START> he is very good in this role as a <UNK> and bored husband a <UNK> air force officer who becomes bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change br br one evening he meets karen an attractive woman younger than his current wife a relationship develops and cole decides to take it to the next level br br not only does he have an affair he <UNK> his death to escape his family <UNK> lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife happy and to project the image that he is a success a fictional <UNK> apparently br br this was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing cole is believable and excellent in these roles recommended 8 10
<START> this movie is supposed to take place in <UNK> <UNK> i know the house that it is based on as well as the person as you see at the end of she was killed in the world trade center incident i know that because i was one of the police officers that helped with the <UNK> of her remains she was the only one in our area lost the nudity in the movie went a bit far i am not a <UNK> but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing this movie is in poor taste and i cannot see how her family would give there <UNK> to it this is an insult to the person whom it is based on
<START> rita hayworth is right there where she should be as a cover girl in this 1944 technicolor film also starring gene kelly phil <UNK> eve <UNK> lee <UNK> and otto <UNK> rita plays a beautiful <UNK> rusty working at a small club owned by the man she loves danny kelly each friday they go out for <UNK> with genius <UNK> the club comedian they all hate <UNK> but they're looking for a pearl when they find one all three of them will have good luck they believe br br rusty <UNK> and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner <UNK> sees a resemblance between rusty and the girl he once loved who turns out to be grandmother once she becomes the cover girl the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on broadway come true danny wants her to have her success but at the same time realizes he's lost her br br cover girl has <UNK> dance numbers and songs by <UNK> <UNK> with rita dubbed by martha <UNK> rita is at her best playing both rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past for such a sexy <UNK> gorgeous woman she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of <UNK> men none of this ever showed on screen nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star she is one of the true <UNK> and brought everything she did to life gene kelly is in a serious role here but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing phil <UNK> is very <UNK> and funny as the in house comic and best friend br br this is a very good movie with no dull spots the only problem i had is the idea that rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves when <UNK> <UNK> who plays herself in the film speaks of getting married she's warned by her boss not to that she's too necessary to the <UNK> business we're not told if rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at <UNK> but all signs seemed to point toward the brooklyn club why couldn't she have had both nevertheless you can't beat cover girl for top entertainment beautiful color lovely music great energy fine performances and its most fabulous asset the glorious rita hayworth
<START> i will never go to another tarantino movie again the entire film was worthless my wife and i both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline blood guts and violence seemed to be the only real theme but we kept hoping <UNK> be something redeeming just around the corner unfortunately there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense we along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater <UNK> that was disgusting what a waste of time i should've walked out where was the comedy that was pathetic etc it actually made us the audience voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off the only thing of merit in the film was the <UNK> and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film there just wasn't a plot script worthy of their talents i rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0 i can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0
<START> hartley on low key form martin <UNK> born to play jesus comes as <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> p j harvey is excellent as sidekick a slight film but amusing short and sweet
<START> jamie foxx did an incredible job playing ray charles i loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie when ray charles was little he went blind and his mother didn't baby him she was a strong woman who didn't treat him any different because he was blind she made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life his mother also sent him to school as well then when ray charles became a man he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into <UNK> sex and betrayal when i am <UNK> about something i can just think of this movie and it will inspire me
<START> quality entertainment all around the spectacle of <UNK> on his <UNK> is one thats as memorable as any in cinema history there's just not a bad thing to be said tons of muppets great cameos slapstick <UNK> whatever you want its here the lovers the <UNK> and me indeed
<START> <UNK> in 1982 from a los angeles production this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter <UNK> on dvd in 2004 in a <UNK> digital transfer it is quite stunning and lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated of course it is <UNK> music and lyrics that make this possible if anyone doubts that he is one of the <UNK> of the american musical form listen to this the sets are stark as <UNK> the plot and clever in allowing the swift scene changes required and the cameras catch the action without <UNK> the fact that this is a stage production a central move able and revolving platform is mrs pie shop with the shop upstairs around it are various and moving stairs to allow the rest of the action to take place the brutal tale of injustice leading to revenge murder and mayhem is <UNK> <UNK> with dark humour and comic moments <UNK> does for <UNK> <UNK> what hitchcock did for <UNK> an important work in american musical theatre is here given an <UNK> performance
<START> the best part of this dvd is the cover it goes down hill from there there was no chemistry between the leads the kisses looked like something i <UNK> with my grandmother br br the sound was so bad that at least i was <UNK> some of the <UNK>
<START> what can i say curse of monkey island is fantastic the story is good and solid but appropriately silly the jokes are <UNK> the <UNK> are puzzling you couldn't ask for more in an adventure game the you don't need to see my <UNK> bit is in itself well worth buying the game for not to mention murray who has become the hot topic among many of my friends only some of whom have played the game you will love this game and if you don't too bad
<START> this movie is a disaster within a disaster film it is full of great action scenes which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality let's see word to the wise <UNK> burns you steam burns you you can't stand next to <UNK> <UNK> a minor <UNK> flow is difficult let alone a significant one scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie br br even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film i mean the acting is actually very good the effects are above average hard to believe somebody read the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted i guess my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on tv look away it is like a train wreck it is so awful that once you know what is coming you just have to watch look away and spend your time on more meaningful content
<START> if you are having trouble sleeping or just want to take that <UNK> in the afternoon but just can't seem to drift off pop in this movie the only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes aside from that prepare for some sweet it <UNK> the mind how big name stars such as those in this movie can be part of the one of the <UNK> movies i've ever seen now if you will excuse me i will finish my <UNK>
<START> great little ground breaking movie in 1955 about an important subject br br i wasn't expecting much from sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised by it loved kim novak she was gorgeous br br loved the jazz score by elmer <UNK> as great as that by <UNK> for <UNK> i am very surprised it doesn't seem available on cd if anyone knows about the <UNK> <UNK> on any other format they should post it here somewhere br br <UNK> direction was as usual borderline flawless br br haven't read nelson novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it the subplot of frankie as a hot card dealer was a bit of a surprise too as were a few other things but see for yourself it's very much worth seeing
<START> well i will come clean and admit that i was forced as part of my history degree to watch this film and then write a short film review as part of my grade br br yet even if i had watched the film alone at my own <UNK> i found it extremely boring and absurd the style is dated beyond its years and the acting is <UNK> rather than use dialogue they instead exchange eye popping <UNK> at each other or sometimes into thin air for me such over the top acting does not convey any greater emotion and after seeing an extreme close up face for the <UNK> time i was praying for the film to end br br the most disappointing though is how wrong character is this man was nasty his <UNK> murderous thugs and his character cowardly for me the film was nothing but a piece of <UNK> propaganda inaccurate and dull
<START> tv director uses <UNK> projection to kill people taking the form of the blue man br br dull <UNK> horror film that kind of just sits there before your eyes and makes you wonder why you are watching it i sat through the film to the end and i really can't give you more than a <UNK> account of what the film was about because i kept finding my attention <UNK> by other things br br i can't really recommend this i think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that i paid a dollar for the dvd as a double feature and i feel kind of ripped off
<START> it's what you expect it <UNK> laughter cringing and dry <UNK> not necessarily in that order it's over the top you will see things that you may never be able to <UNK> from your <UNK> eye jackass number two is better than the first the actors definitely took more risks while filming this movie there are many stunts which could have killed the actors especially johnny <UNK> the treatment of animals was suspect but other than that the movie achieved what is was made to achieve if you like the preview see the movie if you don't steer clear br br 8 out of 10
<START> a <UNK> brit <UNK> com one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy quirky and often surprising this is not the best of <UNK> films kiss kiss bang bang is by far the funniest though it does have a unique charm well written the story <UNK> off into a few dead ends but mostly <UNK> with a new plot high you know from the start how it's going to end but when it comes it is honest and very open ended a realistic and credible ending the end seemed like a beginning enjoyable and left me wanting more
<START> this movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three <UNK> behind me repeating every punchline laughing when there were no gags on screen and <UNK> a <UNK> at every scene involving a computer or mobile device br br for everyone else it's a mean spirited <UNK> comedy the movie strictly follows the formula of the later scary movie films as well as epic movie and meet the <UNK> though without the <UNK> of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating still the <UNK> of intellectual and figures the world over makes it clear that the film knows its audience people who envy <UNK> superhero movie is particularly and consistently nasty to stephen <UNK> introducing him as a sex <UNK> <UNK> and using his <UNK> as a vehicle for slapstick br br the plot is based on spider man with batman begins and x men thrown in just to deliver some physical comedy much of the movie is slapstick but not in any <UNK> or interesting way the longest running gag is a fart joke and early on the <UNK> seem to believe that having the main character get thrown in <UNK> <UNK> of fake animal poo automatically <UNK> an otherwise uninspired rehash of the spider bite scene from spider man perhaps the only redeeming feature of this feature is the energy in it notably absent in other recent parodies the filmmakers act as though they're doing something new and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors <UNK> around the screen an extremely <UNK> length about an hour and fifteen minutes and the <UNK> of the presentation makes superhero movie tolerable rather than horrifying
<START> my family and i enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through br br my own father spent some time in before going onto the thailand <UNK> <UNK> in f force much as been said about the treatment the <UNK> received i will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and <UNK> when <UNK> fell at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 <UNK> tall and <UNK> <UNK> br br no show could truly convey what the <UNK> went through but this comes closer than most br br as the ex <UNK> say if you didn't have mates you didn't survive this show succeeds in getting this message across
<START> my friend made me watch this awful film ugh it was so stupid br br its about some black guy who gets a plane company and turns it into a stupid <UNK> thing br br with <UNK> dog acting as pilot for god knows why this movie is <UNK> white people and having many racist stereotypical events making fun of br br white people and trying to make the movie seem like all black people are cool <UNK> and all white people a losers and black people get all the girls blah blah blah and so forth br br i despise my friend for making me watch this movie i kept saying god turn it off and he's like no i bet something funny is about to happen we did end up finally turning it off half way through thank god br br i recommend this movie to people with very very poor taste in humor
<START> this is one peace of art if you like comedy you should watch this here comes a funny moment from the movie spoiler br br <UNK> and are walking together in paris for the first time they are visiting the local market and goes look <UNK> how much food they have look one two three ten thirty fifty hundred kinds of meat but if ask for a tiny tiny peace just for the taste they won't give you french are very greedy then takes <UNK> to a tv shop tell me who needs all these <UNK> look at this monster here for example points a finger at the monster tv and goes and this <UNK> he is supposed to be digging a <UNK> but no he's on tv wait a minute that's me <UNK> br br wanna laugh watch the movie you won't regret
<START> overall it was a watchable movie i didn't pause it or stop it to come back to it a clear sign of a boring movie so it passed the first test best of all it got into the story fast no boring <UNK> back story for the characters br br it will never go down as a great movie nor as a great b movie i would recommend this movie to slasher horror fans who don't mind straight to video releases br br unlike some movies of it's <UNK> there is no nudity only <UNK> language and rather subdued gore there is violence though the deaths were rather dry and unimaginative sadly the computer special effects were actually pretty good the way the <UNK> <UNK> his chains in some scenes reminded me of and the <UNK> comic books br br a little pet <UNK> it's set in but no one seems to talk with any accent i had to watch the credits to even realize it was filmed in br br like most low budget movies there are small goofs in the filming lack of time and money would be the main factors for the goofs for example in one scene it went from mid afternoon to pitch black in seconds during a short car ride the other instance was the stunt double for the <UNK> didn't have on the <UNK> makeup when falling out of the <UNK> truck it also looks like he's wearing a shirt in the scene br br in summary i didn't hate this movie but i also didn't love it i probably will never rent it again but if a buddy owned it i may watch it again in a few years
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a while the acting was just <UNK> bad is usually a fairly good actor but in this film he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper especially his voice over was extremely wooden beau van was completely over the top as frat boy <UNK> although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue van is an adaptation of a book and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue it all sounded way to <UNK> br br some of the situations were very badly <UNK> example somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a <UNK> goes over in a rapid this bit is just too incredible to be true you see an obviously rather shallow bit of river with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface hence the rapid we hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there's danger ahead a <UNK> with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid our hero then <UNK> several <UNK> below the surface to rescue one of the girl girl <UNK> in his arms and <UNK> the words <UNK> saved me ' vomit br br it actually was so bad that it became funny this is sad because it really wasn't intended at the <UNK> i <UNK> some guy behind me say <UNK> god there's another part ' my feelings exactly what scares me is that the end credits of van were in english does this mean that it will be released abroad just when the <UNK> were starting to get a good reputation after films like <UNK> line and character
<START> you would probably get something like this i'm <UNK> movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5 year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence of course there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art but when someone <UNK> for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of <UNK> scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things br br one more thing i can tolerate political <UNK> very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the <UNK> female character was just too much i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous even in an unrealistic art movie to portray a <UNK> woman as a half <UNK> <UNK> creature connected to the forces of nature probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and <UNK> <UNK> on a three <UNK> <UNK>
<START> just after having moved into his new <UNK> in the english country <UNK> <UNK> gets an <UNK> to dinner from sir henry and lady the owners of a large mansion nearby but the next day one of the guests is found shot near the pool and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away br br this agatha christie mystery is somewhat thin though the killer's plan is still very clever it's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level this episode mostly keeps the serious tone of five little pigs and sad but contains more dark humor than them the cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point edward fox as the butler and sarah miles as lady though the standout performance is given by the <UNK> beautiful <UNK> <UNK> as the ahead of her time <UNK> her one on one <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and are the highlights of the film oh and since an english police inspector does get involved in the case i think they could have brought philip jackson back for this one
<START> this movie is stupid there's no getting around it but so is dumb and dumber mind you dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this however i for one love seeing stupid movies tail <UNK> and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is call me <UNK> but see this movie and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it
<START> one of the message boards threads at imdb had two women talking about colin <UNK> how they watched the movie only because of him obviously these were two young women but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally the brilliant and i mean brilliant performances by michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange were hardly noticed not only by audiences but by the academy and by most of the critics br br i think i know why first the plot or actually just the setup is a kind of <UNK> of shakespeare's king <UNK> with the dying crazy <UNK> and the three scheming daughters who will <UNK> their names even begin with the same letters <UNK> and rose <UNK> and caroline and i guess larry jason <UNK> works for <UNK> the apparent idea <UNK> by jane <UNK> in her <UNK> prize winning novel was to tell a <UNK> like story from the point of view of the daughters and to tell it a sort of late <UNK> century realistic way not considered by the <UNK> the problem is in <UNK> and story the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities his only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm however we can even <UNK> that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it br br the second problem and this is one i cannot personally <UNK> to not having read <UNK> novel is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel still it is almost always the case that an excellent novel especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances cannot be <UNK> transferred to the screen the vision and audio demands of film <UNK> out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints don't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist given five or six hours perhaps could have made a movie more in keeping with <UNK> novel br br a third problem is one that is perhaps alone she began her directing career with the very well done aussie film proof 1991 starring russell <UNK> she follow it up with how to make an american <UNK> 1995 which celebrated women especially women of a certain age however it was a bit heavy handed and clearly and <UNK> a chick flick in a sense a thousand <UNK> takes off from there showing us not only the point of view of women but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some larry cook is clearly a bad bad daddy he beat his daughters and he had <UNK> knowledge of them he ran the household with an iron fist jess colin <UNK> character <UNK> the inexperienced <UNK> and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear and then he goes to rose who clearly is going to be the power behind the new <UNK> and <UNK> up with her while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident the rest of the men are one dimensional characters without nuance the way they often appear in romance novels i think most audiences were put off by the heavy handed incest adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story br br having said all this i think the critics and the public are wrong i think the direction was biased against men but in this story it needed to be i think did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty and the acting by pfeiffer and lange was nothing short of sensational they seemed to feed off of one another in a way that i found absolutely authentic and deeply moving in particular pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent up anger and hatred the way allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to outstanding performance and the skill with which guided the change in character as she went from a as she called herself to someone with self awareness and some understandable <UNK> was also excellent the fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else he needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back and <UNK> in his intensity and madness was also very good br br i predict that this film which bombed in theaters will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on dvd my question is whatever happened to her talent is obvious but she has yet to director her fourth feature film when she does i hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well i think actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film but didn't pay enough attention to the others in addition to the <UNK> father jennifer jason <UNK> caroline was unfinished leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did and the husbands needed to be something more than <UNK> they needed to be engaged and involved
<START> <UNK> 30 is all i paid as rent for the dvd of the movie and believe me it is not worth it br br bollywood directors think that showing fools is funny well it is not please grow up br br here goes a dialog from the movie <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> br br plot is useless criminals and police alike running after fools that is it <UNK> <UNK> br br well it lived the title i had to run away from it i switched over to star movies and watched home alone 2 instead and had a good laugh
<START> why is it that such romantic movies that never actually go anywhere always start and probably end with crappy jazz it's not clever and it makes it look like a bloody tv movie this film was sappy slow paced boring unoriginal wooden and did i say boring br br harrison ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude but he was just a <UNK> <UNK> cop that seemed to walk into the <UNK> woman's home like everything was fine when he <UNK> like a <UNK> staring at thomas with a <UNK> <UNK> hardly ever bothering to speak br br and why the hell do they always get british actors to put on crappy accents they're casted because they're famous and everybody knows they're british precisely because they're famous
<START> acting 10 script 1 is from that unfortunate <UNK> school of theatre that has <UNK> anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden while people may get away with this on stage on film it becomes deadly or at least deadly dull we're left with a bunch of great actors <UNK> dialogue that while brilliantly written adds up to nothing even worse every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds the only attempt to <UNK> is to have teen <UNK> anna <UNK> use the word ain't br br never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme the camera work is plain sloppy and for la residents the attention to <UNK> is laughable hint the view out sean <UNK> front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window and you can't drive south through hollywood and wind up in pretending to be <UNK> okay suspension of disbelief and all that and normally i wouldn't pay attention to little things like that because they are just <UNK> of production but the fact that they did stick out so much despite the <UNK> <UNK> on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise the script br br in short skip this one even on video picked the wrong quote from the scottish play for his title would have been better named a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury <UNK> nothing a bit long for the <UNK> perhaps but at least it would be honest advertising
<START> this movie doesn't even deserve a 1 10 this movie was a <UNK> br br i swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were copied from <UNK> 1 2 3 the whole movie <UNK> was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a thriller action packed dinosaur copy i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming to i recommend you see the <UNK> movie first all of them and then watch this and you will know what i mean br br spencer
<START> being a huge fan of bergman i had to search literally years to find this movie at a price less than 60 i mean and finally bought it a few weeks ago the basic premise of <UNK> films are the relationships between the characters and how they deal with trying situations this film therefore is the same yet it is different because the setting is far different than most of the bergman films the i have seen br br it is set in wartime and the <UNK> are caught in the middle br br it is riveting from start to finish and it once again proves that <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best actresses of the 20th century a must see
<START> warning this may contain spoilers br br first of all i watch a lot lifetime movies and realize they are just that lifetime movies some are great really some are good and some are bad unfortunately this movie falls into the latter category it actually started out with some potential single divorced hard working mom who gets out of work at 2 00 am cuts a guy off while driving home from work and let's just say he doesn't take it too well the stalking begins immediately with phone call hang ups and <UNK> to her home being broken into and completely <UNK> so she goes to her mother's for the night and the next morning her mother's car blows up this seems to be just a pain in the butt for our heroine who deals with it by going underwear and jewelry shopping so the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping and what does mom do she goes off to work leaving the kid all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a pizza i couldn't believe it then it really gets stupid and the ending just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical too bad because it seemed to have possibilities
<START> i'm aware that there are some fans who might like this movie i'm aware that the idea of for <UNK> might appear interesting to some to me however it's really boring br br the movie is simply boring when it does get a little bit interesting it gets stupid come on kirk fights against god and wins how low can we possibly get the only good part in the film is the camping scene at the first 5 minutes which is truly great but after that the movie becomes boring irritating with nothing more than a good music br br thank god we have star trek <UNK> <UNK> kirk beat him
<START> and i may be being generous the overwhelming majority of the movie consists of <UNK> footage the <UNK> monster two women <UNK> the <UNK> monster again a bunch of people in the pool the <UNK> monster again none the worse for wear despite having been injured you get the picture i restrained myself from yelling get on with it already on several occasions br br and it doesn't help that the footage they used was poorly produced the sound is <UNK> out of sync with the image and in the one scene where they tried to get artistic with the lighting and camera techniques the lighting guy holding the <UNK> that provides the <UNK> only <UNK> is clearly visible in the shot br br my hope is that the production was the victim of some horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed but they decided to release it anyways <UNK> together from the editing room floor in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save the real film the one with the plot and the interesting dialog sadly there's no evidence of this and i'm forced to conclude that in the immortal words of joel and the <UNK> they just didn't care br br
<START> melancholy of is based on somewhat pat formula by now of japanese school drama anime the formula somewhat goes like this br br 1 the main protagonist comes from world outside the normal society and has super powers br br 2 there's a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role br br 3 a normal character is in there who shares the main role in the story br br 4 unusual things happens in an usual social settings br br 5 sometimes the story is about the main protagonist and the normal character that <UNK> to the existence or destruction of the world br br 6 absolutely no effort is spent by anyone to gain all the magical powers they just have it br br 7 usually people outside of this tight <UNK> group is not aware of their super powers and goes on with their daily lives br br so there you have it melancholy of is made along these lines which became the success formula for comics and anime in japan even though it follows a pat formula the series is superbly crafted and the episodes are always set in an interesting back drop within the normal social settings which always <UNK> into unusual circumstances surrounding each player in the story brings some unusual insight into the daily life that usually we are not aware of the philosophical twist of their insights are what makes this series extra entertaining the visuals are first rate and done beautifully br br the crazy ideas always seem to come up with along with complicated settings of the story may give you headache from time to time it's further complicated by the fact that the episodes are played out of sequence which further adds to the confusion when i watched the episodes in the <UNK> sequence some of the plots finally made sense i recommend you do the same it's much more entertaining to watch the series this way <UNK> br br list of the melancholy of episodes br br for the correct sequence of all the episodes and oh you might notice the headache while you're watching this like i did let me know if you had it too
<START> although i have rarely <UNK> myself i am <UNK> interested in <UNK> and this film has added to the precious laughing stock in <UNK> cinema br br 1 why is the captain doing the ground <UNK> why does he even measure the oil levels in the <UNK> with <UNK> times as low as 15 minutes in commercial <UNK> this is not a typical pre flight check br br 2 why does the captain kick against the aircraft tire strange kind of pressure check or anger management br br 3 the <UNK> has a crew of 3 all large western two <UNK> built since the <UNK> have a crew of 2 people now try a guess at how old the movie script is br br 4 a helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled <UNK> must be a fast one and the <UNK> words to explain the <UNK> to the passengers are indeed hilarious ones br br 5 with arrested elevator it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft it happens for example when any aircraft moves slower than the <UNK> speed br br 6 the elevator have <UNK> after the <UNK> with the business plane it would most probably have severed the <UNK> lines and thus make them useless for <UNK> but it would not fix them in certain position br br 7 the fire in the <UNK> <UNK> was a stupid idea it was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the <UNK> and fight the fire regardless of who was actually trained to do that  the flight attendant br br 8 at the time of <UNK> the <UNK> would have been in a neutral position the film could have ended here br br 9 the flight engineer the third person in the <UNK> has three bars on his uniform in reality flight <UNK> have two br br 10 why does the captain slash the cabin <UNK> with an axe to examine the damage behind i thought it would have been the flight duty as he is already supposed to perform technical <UNK> before and after flight br br 11 in any aircraft there is no <UNK> space at least commercial <UNK> cannot afford the luxury of a <UNK> that can be filled with tons of water br br i could go on and on but at last i laughed hysterically about how the screenwriters imagine aircraft disasters most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time span that you simply cannot make 90 minute flicks out of them but you can always fill 90 minutes with mind <UNK> and insane crap <UNK> of the genre
<START> i believe that this was supposed to be shocking or something all that i can say is poor goat this flick is so poorly done that the parts that should shock and revolt you come across as laughable at best the characters are so lame and 2 wait 1 dimensional that i <UNK> each sick death all except that poor goat br br
<START> i must have seen this movie about four or five times already and it gets better with each viewing suffice it to say this is the best film i've ever seen and i think i've seen a lot br br but i've always wondered why this film got so <UNK> in some reviews or ratings for example take the imdb top 250 why does it rank only at <UNK> as of today surely the not in the film itself because that is nothing but flawless but in its reception the film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its anti death penalty attitude and so obviously the more conservative minded user probably didn't like the film as you can see from some of the other comments so dead man walking gets a <UNK> that's nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality those people didn't understand what the film wanted to say and maybe they didn't want to understand being pro death penalty so now i get it it's all political you're pro death penalty you don't like and therefore don't want to hear what the film has to say br br i'm truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefs br br mr robbins your movie's issue split people's opinions some <UNK> their point of view some simply didn't listen but you made a very important point your movie will probably never show up on any top 100 movies of all time list but it'll be remembered long after films like braveheart or babe or apollo 13 all of which were <UNK> preferred over your film at the oscars 1996 are forgotten <UNK> mr robbins and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking
<START> fritz lang directed two great westerns western union and the return of frank james the frank james movie equals jesse james western union is one of randolph scott's great westerns i have never seen robert young in a western before he is terrific as the <UNK> employee this is the only movie i can think of that is about the <UNK> company opening up in the west it is a high <UNK> story about the <UNK> in the west a triangle love story and about loyalty br br the supporting cast is superb dean jagger who made a few westerns plays the <UNK> manager virginia <UNK> who plays mr <UNK> sister is the love interest in the movie ms <UNK> had a short career in movies she quit films in <UNK> and became a drama coach she is primarily known as the first mrs <UNK> <UNK> it is great to see slim <UNK> in a movie with mr scott again they were in two other great movies rebecca of <UNK> farm and jesse james
<START> let's cut through everything in the first paragraph the the <UNK> film by the <UNK> brothers danny and <UNK> as a horror movie is profoundly bad and just as a movie in general is a big disappointment it's nothing but a sixth sense and as long as that picture is still available there is no reason on earth to pay money to see this turkey br br lately horror slasher films such as the final destination series wrong turn boogie man the ring 2 and the grudge are becoming increasingly more <UNK> on big shocks with no payoff for instance something jumps out at the person on screen <UNK> a gasp from the audience but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something little goes into making it a genuine frightening experience like the sixth sense or signs or some of the classic horror movies of the 1940s <UNK> and '60s br br the relies upon the same old tired clichés as these newer far inferior films and is <UNK> old tired and to my surprise ended up as one of the most boring movies i have seen in awhile br br the plot has another stupid family led by dad roy dylan mcdermott the practice mom denise penelope ann miller <UNK> <UNK> cop tv series desperate <UNK> big <UNK> jess <UNK> stewart a space adventure and <UNK> ben <UNK> turner who move to north <UNK> from chicago br br the reason for the move is never really <UNK> here but it has something to do with the <UNK> inability to find work and <UNK> drunken driving <UNK> we know there will be trouble immediately because they move into a big gothic house in the middle of nowhere a <UNK> that looks like the <UNK> summer home oh and the first five minutes of the movie show something really horrible happened there br br jess hates the place hey who could blame her but optimistic pop hopes to make a go out of raising despite the unusually large amount of <UNK> <UNK> about but when he meets <UNK> john <UNK> raising helen and looking like kevin <UNK> in the film version of my name is earl an <UNK> drifter and expert on raising things start to pick up br br but then weird things begin to happen jess is <UNK> by a violent unseen force in the house of course no one else but the two year old ben can see it so she's labeled a <UNK> and the <UNK> keep hanging around ben also is able to <UNK> the <UNK> creatures but since he's two he cannot <UNK> it scene after scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he sees finally had me wanting to yell to the screen he can't tell you he's two <UNK> years old yes have the only protagonist who can solve all of these things be a mute <UNK> is real smart br br anyway we're left to <UNK> the sanity of jess when and if ben will ever properly describe the <UNK> visions he sees if dad will make the <UNK> thing work if the high <UNK> drifter is a good guy or bad what the point of the george <UNK> looking <UNK> is how a <UNK> <UNK> in the back can only be a flesh wound what mom's role in the family is and where are all the <UNK> coming from br br all of this while waiting and wondering for something anything to happen the conclusion is really lame as well and once again begs the question of how a spirit which has no physical body can cause harm to a living person very dull pointless and most terrible of all not frightening in the least br br oh and there are a lot of <UNK> in this movie
<START> al pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without <UNK> to constant use of profanity in other words when he could act he didn't have to talk like some street <UNK> <UNK> must have been impressed by pacino because he became a <UNK> of the f word also this might be the kind of society that they actually live in but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company i don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity but it was something like this it shows a lack of intelligence poor language skills and <UNK> for all those that have to listen maybe it is time that al takes some acting <UNK> again to <UNK> his talent oh yes the movie probably the worse thing that <UNK> has played in hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people <UNK> russo as always was hot
<START> i don't know about the real <UNK> but i got the distinct impression that the <UNK> aim was to try to <UNK> his <UNK> edges and reputation not give us a true portrait of the man himself in the movie besides a few racist remarks he's shown to be just another hard <UNK> old <UNK> he's so full of life with a heart of gold more or less this is also the worst acting i've seen t l jones do he brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotyped character he just doesn't flesh out <UNK> in a way that pulls me into the movie not for one minute did i forget that it was tommy lee jones on the screen pretending to be <UNK> <UNK> robert <UNK> didnt impress either the comedic elements in this movie were just distracting and didnt ring true at all a bloody waste of time it is
<START> terrible there's no way to get around it a script at the level of one from some mexican soap opera a choice and use of the places of shooting that make the movie <UNK> and at the same time repetitive and monotonous with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast the references to <UNK> work so poorly made are more an insult than anything else i suspect that was not for the shameless and plot unrelated exploitation of generous <UNK> nobody would take the effort to go watch this film to any theater br br these are the kind of films that make me have no desire to watch portuguese cinema
<START> these days you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1 a <UNK> teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2 involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy girl every time 3 revolves around <UNK> yelling and <UNK> humor about 95 of shows on disney <UNK> and cartoon network fit the listed <UNK> to put in simpler terms they all lack good acting originality and good story telling it as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail they couldn't be more unaware sure kids enjoy a good laugh and <UNK> behavior if it's done to a conservative level and done right but as they also want to enjoy a story see drama and see people being challenged they don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want they know this world isn't all fun and games they know it's not perfect everyone has problems and we all must learn to work around them this show revolves around that kind of stuff alex mack is an average teenage girl who seems to have everything going for her genius sister annie her mom works at some office but is sometimes a stay at home parent her dad george is a top scientist at the plant a chemical corporation that employs most of the town they live in paradise valley alex is <UNK> and picked on by most of her peers her only friend is ray but she gets more friends as the series goes on her first day of jr high alex walks home not too happy about school but a truck delivering <UNK> from the plant crashes into a fire trying to avoid running her over <UNK> a strange chemical known as <UNK> <UNK> where the chemical mixes with the water covering alex in it soon after she starts to develop strange powers such as <UNK> into a <UNK> shooting <UNK> out of her hand and moving things with her mind she also <UNK> constantly when nervous though we never see much of that later on aside from her sister annie and friend ray alex decides to keep these powers a secret from everyone even her parents for fear of being kidnapped by the plant whose corrupt owner <UNK> has her head of security vince search for the mysterious kid every episode then deals with alex trying to live a normal life as kid at the same time learning to live with her strange powers the series may seem like a girls show but it's not as a boy i liked watching this show because of its awesome effects and drama the producers successfully add some elements of science fiction with the elements of teen drama in fact some episodes were quiet violent and a little eerie the <UNK> plant manager and vince make good <UNK> for the series for the writers really do establish them as a threat and give you that dreadful feeling every time they come on screen also smart move adding david driver of the truck that <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> bumbling assistant in the hunt for comedic effect but also you get to love him towards the end it was interesting to watch little alex try to live as a normal kid but struggles to perfect her powers at times you forget that these are kids who are battling a giant adult run institution because you are drawn in to the story the show does a good job of relating to kids by showing alex that she may have super powers but she still is a kid and must be careful even some episode you'll find yourself <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> my favorite episode where alex wishes she was never born truly demonstrates most of these elements as i said the producers never <UNK> to add in some laughs whether they come from <UNK> one liner or <UNK> strange <UNK> or david trying to be a nice guy of course you come across corny moments and an entire episode that really has nothing to do with the series plot but what good series doesn't all in all great show 9 10
<START> oh the horror i've seen a lot of gore movies in my day but this one just makes me gag with with laughter rather than <UNK> this is definitely a crazy movie and is very low budget i might add but if you're able to look past the cheap audio horrible dialogue ugly girls the obviously fake gore scenes and overall of the film then you might find some of this film to be somewhat entertaining the story is about a copy cat killer who goes on a killing spree every <UNK> day of the <UNK> month of the <UNK> year wow how original and it's up to two detectives one of whom gave a <UNK> effort at trying to make the dialogue good to stop the killer's bloody rampage the killing scenes which are done with a plastic toy knife are pretty brutal which is a good thing but very annoying due to the constant <UNK> of an obviously recorded scream which is very ear <UNK> as for the gore there's plenty of it but it looks very fake especially the blood dude c'mon purple blood but if you're a fan of gore videos like myself then you'll find something in this video to <UNK> like i did the crap talking detective he's the best thing going for this film other than that all you're going to find is a bunch of senseless nudity which is also a good thing but too bad the girls are and a very idiotic <UNK> <UNK> serial killer sorry but this one sucks
<START> ok i for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film plus with the cast line up i was sure it couldn't get less than a 6 in my books however i got annoyed half hour into the story just where normal films get good this film hit rock bottom br br spoiler the guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the <UNK> that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the <UNK> <UNK> not only that he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up <UNK> more people and long story short the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the <UNK> death but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying <UNK> deaths br br but in the end he is happy because he came to his senses halfway through the <UNK> so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire this film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick ruined a good story shame really
<START> i went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site i really don't have time to write reviews but i felt this was my duty as a sci fi horror buff this is only the second review i have written the other was for dracula 3000 now to the point this movie sucked plain and simple i kept wondering if i was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those lovely comments i have seen movies with bad effects bad acting bad sound you name it and i've seen it but this really sucked i don't care how much it costs or didn't cost to make movies like this and dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and <UNK> for time murder by the way did i mention that this movie sucked i mean really sucked the plot was non exist and the acting was weak it seems like the writer saw pitch black and got upset because he didn't think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version but instead the suck factor took over and possessed him don't watch this you'll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning <UNK>
<START> there is a lot to like in this film despite its humble <UNK> of a preachy pc tale about rape and the <UNK> always <UNK> better than the victim the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes i for one was sure it was the teacher in fact that would have been more <UNK> plot wise because the idea of the best friend's boy friend kind of came out of nowhere i guess the point of that is that rape is <UNK> you never know who it is going to be ms is <UNK> as always yet see discussion board for my <UNK> of this statement like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip <UNK> <UNK> as the mom is in the role she was born to play the <UNK> over protective mom some good 70s scenes for 70s fans the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a must for fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s high school melodrama or 70s <UNK> in general
<START> this short film certainly pulls no punches the story is of a butcher who <UNK> kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually <UNK> his retarded daughter the film goes onto depict how the butcher serves his time and returns to life with his daughter in care and having to come to terms with a life with no future br br the graphic opening scenes of a horse being slaughtered and the full frontal birth of the <UNK> daughter puts you a brutal frame of mind that stays with you throughout the film br br the snappy flow of the film is very direct and adds to its brutality consequently alot of ground is covered in the 40 minutes you are taken in fully with the <UNK> non life particularly after he loses his daughter to social services and his business his story continues in the excellent film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> am not from america i usually watch this show on channel i don't know why this respected channel air such sucking program in prime time <UNK> creation of hollywood's money bank jerry bruckheimer this time he is spending a big load of cash in the small screen in each episode a bunch of peoples having two team members travels from on country to another for a great sum of money where the camera <UNK> shoot their travels i don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show it has nothing to watch for in all episodes we see people ran like <UNK> some times shouting crying <UNK> jerky camera works huh it's <UNK> to both eyes and ears the most disgusting part in the race is the viewers finally knows each of the team members can't enjoy their race traveling experience even though to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including gays in one shows sucking american reality show br br it's nothing to watch for better switch to another channels br br the amazing race the disgusting show
<START> this movie has good intentions at least in the message don't be afraid no matter how tough it can be fear will kill you in the end it's a good message but the <UNK> is so flawed that the message gets <UNK> by bad acting complete lack of credibility in the feelings dialog that's delivered as if it were read out loud stereotypes instead of breathing living people br br it <UNK> from effects such as slow motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus a lack of emotional force br br the <UNK> part of it still reminds me of a low budget film from the pre 90s when lesbians seemed to have at least on celluloid an utter <UNK> of live good happy lives and a tendency to get caught in over the top dramas that often involved <UNK> death or prison br br had it focused on the <UNK> of living life according to how we feel it and not according to how others think we should live it it would have being less dramatic more inspiring but it doesn't it focuses of pain on loss and leaves the message at just a <UNK> ideal br br i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and <UNK> br br if you're looking for a really good movie that talks about <UNK> fear and daring to live what you feel go back to the magnificent desert hearts even better read the novel
<START> the two most noteworthy things about i won't play are it won an academy award as the best two reel short film of 1944 and it was directed by silent era leading man <UNK> <UNK> the plot of this run of the mill short is <UNK> the dialogue lacks spark while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most war themed hollywood movies of the 1940s in other words it's awful admittedly there are moments when i won't play is funny <UNK> <UNK> totally artificial look and line delivery are precious but one laughs at the picture not with it
<START> john decided as his first film obviously as one shot on a <UNK> in new york to not even have a script with dialog and delivers a 1959 feature equivalent of larry david's <UNK> your enthusiasm all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk in other words it's one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation <UNK> <UNK> in it's score and telling a tale of racial tensions a group of black siblings are the center point with one trying to get better <UNK> than the average strip club and has a sister much more light skinned than him who gets <UNK> with a white man in a relationship which <UNK> both sides the film however isn't exclusively about that <UNK> likes to have his characters wander around new york city which not many films did in 1959 1960 and his style of storytelling is like that of the <UNK> jazz artists of the day dated to be sure but worth a glance for film buffs martin scorsese named this as one of his <UNK> influences
<START> episode no thirteen of the <UNK> excuse the incredibly gay <UNK> supernatural tv series <UNK> sam and dean winchester to <UNK> where they have been called upon by an old flame of <UNK> to investigate a string of mysterious murders occurring in their small town as it turns out a large pick up truck with an unseen driver is running down african americans on a desolate stretch of road while dean attempts to <UNK> his past love affair more towns people turn up as <UNK> the cause appears to be due to a past racial incident back in the 60s causing a frustrated redneck spirit to remain in ghostly <UNK> seeking to kill black <UNK> route <UNK> is another good installment which isn't <UNK> i've noticed which contains a few notable aspects <UNK> to the pair of main characters such as dean getting laid and <UNK> admitted regret for having left college the killer truck come across as the most terrifying thing in the world though for an hour long show it does it's job well not a hands down fantastic episode but a solid concept with more horror movie references
<START> comparing this movie to anything by <UNK> is an insult to <UNK> the best thing i can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an <UNK> movie and fails miserably the script is dreadful the characters are one dimensional and the performances are the quality of high school drama except <UNK> gay which is pretty good given the material she has to work with furthermore the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of architecture or the <UNK> charm of <UNK> if you enjoy the <UNK> pathos and dark quirky comedy of <UNK> movies you'll find none of them here spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid
<START> with this film being directed by roger <UNK> and quentin tarantino doing the screenplay i was sure this was going to be a gem i was wrong i don't hate this film but in no ways do i like it br br i love roger <UNK> because of his amazing direction in rules of attraction and his screenplays to pulp fiction and silent hill but he made a mistake making this do i really need to comment on tarantino we all know hes a genius br br this movie is just set around a gang robbing a bank but fails due to silly people <UNK> in the robbery br br i'm disappointed in tarantino and <UNK> for doing this film but doesn't change my mind on how amazing they both are everyone makes mistakes 3 10 j d <UNK>
<START> i'm serious as well i mean don't get me wrong if you haven't got a bent for this type of z grade <UNK> creature feature why would you be watching is my first thought then it's a rating of about 3 to 4 out of 10 tops but to me it's a special kind of nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in my childhood you know the kind the memories that never leave you eagerly taking it all in with youthful <UNK> as doug <UNK> and peter cushing tunnel beneath the <UNK> to do battle with a host of creatures and sub human and guys now we are all grown up we can admire most seriously at the wonder of caroline <UNK> and her <UNK> <UNK> no wonder my older brother was keen to take me to the cinema to see this one br br yes the effects are bad men in suits strings parrot monsters around and exploding rubber frog like <UNK> us greatly and yes cushing and a surprisingly <UNK> <UNK> act as if they have truly been <UNK> by the evil at the core of our film but it matters not zany and clunky and <UNK> in glorious colour at the <UNK> core is a <UNK> to a special pre <UNK> time when kids like me around the block to see such <UNK> nonsense 8 10
<START> i had never heard of dead man's bounty when i saw it at the dvd store a few weeks ago and i thought i had stumbled upon an <UNK> gem since it had val kilmer in it in a truly unique role sadly it wasn't more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that i realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions the first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning when you have a bunch of in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of <UNK> in a scene that goes on about five times too long it's unbelievable how bad it is and sadly it doesn't get any better br br val kilmer is featured <UNK> on the movie's cover box maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half wit crooks and the most inept of a unique town sheriff that i've ever seen in a movie he's played by linda who is unable to or <UNK> in covering his polish accent immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the american old west br br does <UNK> have this type of frontier past i don't know my knowledge of polish history is not my strong point but i can tell you this the sheriff as he is known in the movie is the worst representation of law <UNK> that i can ever remember seeing in a movie he is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of <UNK> and a <UNK> of men take turns <UNK> him in the face before they start hitting him he explains that they can each hit him once and then after the first round they will each hit him again and if he can identify who is throwing the punches they lose what the hell is this crap i am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie br br throughout the movie the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and <UNK> and drunk and <UNK> until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally stumbling on screen and <UNK> the you see there is a lot of talk and <UNK> for a hanging the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie br br it takes place by the way in a town that consists of nothing more than two <UNK> wooden buildings facing each other across a <UNK> bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road my understanding is that it is a part of <UNK> that is supposed to look <UNK> enough like the american <UNK> where none of the characters except maybe the dead guy could possibly have come from br br i have heard that val kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role and also by director minimal use of dialogue in favor of a <UNK> on cleverly timed <UNK> of images in unique visual montages br br yeah whatever br br seems to me that was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role personally i would really feel that i had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while i like to think that he didn't even read the script for this mess because if he did i am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the role br br at any rate the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man played by kilmer seeking the reward soon he finds himself <UNK> in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute the alcoholic sheriff and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid stupid characters br br there is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of american <UNK> in one scene a man cuts a <UNK> <UNK> in half and <UNK> the <UNK> into <UNK> eyes for what reason i can't imagine and then later a man makes a short speech over <UNK> corpse in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had and then he proceeds to <UNK> his head off with a <UNK> what the hell br br not convinced yet here are some more reasons not to watch it in one scene the sheriff appears to be covered with ash except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red <UNK> a man gets a head wound that his head and body in blood in a <UNK> he it with <UNK> smart near the end the sheriff appears to have a broken arm sitting at the bar he puts a rope around his neck and <UNK> it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope <UNK> his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth rather than using his good arm to drink also smart br br why doesn't he just use his good arm i have no idea that like everything else in the movie makes no sense whatsoever like the title summer love are you kidding me avoid this mess at all costs br br in the meantime here's something for the imdb goofs page  br br errors made by characters possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers this movie got made ha
<START> <UNK> <UNK> god of <UNK> creates a mask that <UNK> the with cartoon like powers at the command of his father <UNK> he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind in the meantime the <UNK> of the mask <UNK> a child who <UNK> the powers of the mask etc etc if this sounds like a pretty thin plot line it is add to this the fact that the movie is handled <UNK> from start to finish and the result is very very bad you can find worse movies but you'll have to <UNK> search for them br br for the most part son of the mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre <UNK> but in light of scenes such as the mask baby <UNK> <UNK> in six different directions including on his father this premise seems unlikely i asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie and he <UNK> convicted <UNK> apparently forgetting for the moment that the <UNK> <UNK> cruel and unusual punishment br br but just making a bad movie is not a sin or hell would be <UNK> what makes it a sin is that <UNK> million was spent on this piece of garbage to put things in perspective the day after we watched son of the mask my son and i watched good night and good luck a movie that garnered six academy award nominations including best picture and was brought in for 7 million that's right just one <UNK> of the amount of money spent on son of the mask this then is the sin to <UNK> good money down the <UNK> when it could have been better used in making watchable movies or feeding starving children or for that matter almost any other purpose the producers should truly be ashamed of themselves
<START> barbara stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy about a sailor invited to spend christmas with a popular magazine writer's family at her farm in <UNK> the problem is she has no husband baby or farm as she writes about in her <UNK> and she can't even cook her wonderful <UNK> being provided for her by her good friend uncle felix owner of a hungarian restaurant in new york city br br things get even more complicated when her strict <UNK> boss invites himself along for christmas a scheme is <UNK> planned with her <UNK> fiancé providing an actual <UNK> farm neighbors providing a borrowed baby and a quick wedding planned when the <UNK> isn't looking but when the handsome young sailor arrives on christmas eve romantic complications ensue as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of <UNK> for the nice guy navy man and vice versa br br this is a charming warm film that <UNK> <UNK> humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for barbara stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent aided by such marvelous character actors as sydney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> s z and many others a christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe <UNK> delight to see and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough bitchy women in femme fatale roles truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time
<START> movies aren't always suppose to be about deep thoughts sometimes they're simply meant to be escapes from reality out to sea fits the bill perfectly br br a light hearted golden years romantic comedy out to sea may not be big budget you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen but it's still very much a movie worth watching a sweet movie that needs to be given a break br br this is just good light hearted fun it's not meant to be a deep movie it's something worth watching if for nothing else you must see it for brent <UNK> stiff and uptight rendition of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a character you love to hate and mr <UNK> pulls off the perfect evil comic foil to two beloved comedy movie gods

<START> there were some decent moments in this film and a couple of times where it was pretty funny however this didn't make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra <UNK> in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife to be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by there was better chemistry between him and <UNK> tyler in <UNK> hell there was better chemistry between sly and sandra in <UNK> man br br there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving br br this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding wait until it's been out for a year and a half on video and rent it in the <UNK> <UNK> bin if you've got nothing else to do on a rainy sunday afternoon and you can't think of any better movies to rent
<START> the kind of b movies from the 1950's that were <UNK> yet so much fun are to what predator island pays homage filmed in <UNK> predator island is set on an island called with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which is inhabited by only the couple who tends the <UNK> in typical 1950's sci fi fashion after a half dozen young adults crash their boat into the <UNK> rocky shore hideous creatures from outer space <UNK> the island after a meteor hits nearby the creatures start both <UNK> the bodies of their victims as well as <UNK> them lots of <UNK> and lame <UNK> are the primary form of dialogue in this movie it is so hokey that you just have to laugh at times if you are looking for a movie that is stupid but in a fun way then this one fits the bill br br interesting note i appear in the film as a dead body in the far background of the final scene during filming they needed about 50 extras yet around 300 people showed up for the opportunity they eventually used nearly 200 of them
<START> leonard and frances de la tour carry this film not without a struggle as the script was obviously <UNK> <UNK> together out of old episodes when it came out this must have been a real disappointment as it's also done on a bus ticket budget attempts to move it out of the house which is <UNK> <UNK> a bad job all round there with a <UNK> fantasy sequences <UNK> and a boxing match in the local gym simply don't work most of these are just character light <UNK> for a <UNK> not particularly good gag that said the interplay of and de la tour and anybody else with him is mostly hilarious they even manage to make a <UNK> gag work but you can see the struggle with <UNK> a literally uninspired script that changes plot half way through don has very little to do except <UNK> <UNK> and due to the random script <UNK> christopher changes character at least twice and in the end as he often did in the tv series though you might not remember read the scripts eric lets you down with a <UNK> ending were they that cynical or just too desperate to be in the film business and de la tour are always funny but as a film it's a terrible <UNK> to a <UNK> remembered tv series rip
<START> this is one cheap looking movie a stripper keeps getting attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her she goes to the police who also rape her she finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies back to 'the zombie the fact that stephanie <UNK> stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this film
<START> what can i say this was one awful movie to watch i am normally not very critical of gay cinema in general due to the fact that most are usually low budget but this really pushed me up the wall i mean is this was has happened to gay cinema haven't gay producers and directors learned anything from gus van saints and ang lee's films just having to sit through the entire movie was like being in a <UNK> chair and having my wisdom teeth <UNK> i kept on praying for moments where i would feel any sort of connection with any of the characters but that never happened most of the characters performances were just not very convincing it was like watching one of those badly produced made for tv movie <UNK> on a local access tv stations i cannot tell u how greatly disappointed it was seeing this film after being a big fan of <UNK> other works and the directors last work on latter day saints it was definitely not worth the wait definitely a few hours of my life i will never get back and will certainly not be <UNK> it on dvd
<START> this movie was quite a mess there wasn't anything really going for it the only character that had any appeal was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and she wasn't even worth it br br the plot is standard double cross the double crossing double with a few too many double crosses to make any sense sometimes that means it keeps you guessing in this case it keeps you waiting by the end i just wanted everyone to get thrown in jail or shot
<START> this is one of the greatest documentaries i've ever seen along with dark days i have <UNK> for maybe an hour my entire life and i still love this movie <UNK> and his excellent editor captured the feeling and atmosphere perfectly helped in part with some incredible <UNK> footage tony is one of the coolest individuals in existence love those <UNK> high <UNK> sport <UNK> you rock tony br br not only is this movie a visual feast but the soundtrack has to be one of the best in history if you're into 70's rock buy the dvd you won't regret it
<START> the positive reviews on this page are planted by the filmmakers and their friends this film is amateurish in terms of direction acting in fact in every aspect if the imdb are gonna allow filmmakers to <UNK> what is written about their films then that is a very sad thing this film has a <UNK> premise but it is absolutely <UNK> made br br film is <UNK> so everyone has their own opinion but this film is on a par with the work of ed wood but without any of the charm to think otherwise shows bad taste of the highest order br br this is not a personal thing i don't know anyone associated with the film i'm just a film lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and therefore i felt the need to address the balance and give a more accurate view of the film it's very poorly made and the direction is below even film making by the numbers the acting is the worse ever committed to film the best thing about this film is the poster and dvd cover art beyond that it's not worth the time
<START> i got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed it was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic i can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies but not when it's supposed to be a crime drama thing the evidence collection and interview <UNK> were just plain oddball i started fast <UNK> to see how it ended and then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it the main character played by ellen <UNK> just wasn't believable at all <UNK> wilson acted very well in this film but her character was way out there and there wasn't anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work
<START> anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all some people enjoy <UNK> with <UNK> story lines and character development i personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts e g a tale of two sisters <UNK> etc whatever the type of horror film one personally likes there are only a <UNK> few that really scare you is one of them br br this is a documentary style movie which means that the entire film is a <UNK> of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic <UNK> named the premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by <UNK> people associated with the demonic <UNK> associated with then <UNK> footage from other sources that link with his research what results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing despite the fact that the story itself is fake br br some have compared with the blair witch project but the only similarity is the documentary style one obvious difference between the films is that scares the viewer by <UNK> events to one another using different sources for example the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is <UNK> and sees something strange on the <UNK> later in the film a clip from another character's home video introduces that very same strange <UNK> the viewer's memory <UNK> the two incidents and chills start running down their spine another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one in fact her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking later on however that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event this is intelligent film making indeed br br another difference between and blair witch is that provides not one but two very long <UNK> the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema i do not say such things lightly it totally <UNK> me in a <UNK> way br br other aspects of film making are well done the legend and <UNK> background of are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job the only over the top performance comes from a guy who's supposed to be crazy anyway so that's expected the cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on <UNK> japanese films are not known for their special effects but the effects used here were awesome in some cases they create an other <UNK> feel e g the static <UNK> or the first finale but in other cases they are <UNK> realistic e g the second finale br br when all is said and done goes down as the scariest film i've ever seen i would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like does see it now
<START> ha ha oh no what to say about this film yes green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie where does one start a lot of the good stuff has already been said so i won't <UNK> into the same territory i believe you already have the movie summary so i won't <UNK> the movie br br first let's start the with good br br 1 if you like psychological thrillers that make you think as i do the first <UNK> minutes of this film will be for you this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like what if you had to chose one family member live another to die or what if you had to die by drowning or fire this movie is a great concept bottom line br br 2 the wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's realistically though how difficult is that to accomplish okay that's about all for the good let's talk about the bad br br 1 this movie feels like a 2 hour twilight zone episode this could easily be 90 minutes that might have made the movie tolerable br br 2 do you remember in the movie from <UNK> <UNK> dawn the movie started out interesting then halfway through the movie it just took a <UNK> turn yep same thing here i would venture to say that the writers started with a concept then had no idea what to do with it i've gotten deeper thought <UNK> out of transformers 2 br br 3 yes we get the dilemma in the film we understand the philosophical undertones and <UNK> approach but the story jumped around way too much didn't elaborate on the current story arc and took a forgive me completely insulting direction br br 4 the ending didn't make sense not at all none br br this movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101 if you're board out of your mind in bed sick or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie and can view this free on line by all means go for it br br if you need to pay anything to view this movie don't waste your time you're better off watching old <UNK> <UNK> stand up on you tube you will get more philosophical <UNK> your <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is not a new film it is a re cut of <UNK> <UNK> queen of the galaxy and it has been significantly <UNK> warning many characters appear in the credits that have been cut from the movie br br if you want to see this one in its original form pick up queen avoid this one at all costs as the cuts make it even than it was originally
<START> jude law gives keanu reeves a run for his money as the most wooden actor around <UNK> <UNK> character is straight out of the beverly <UNK> and the two leads have about as much chemistry as darth vader and queen the bad guys are the worst kind of cliche and there's not a subtle moment in the film incredible that some critics actually liked this movie
<START> spoilers br br i've heard some <UNK> about the special effects but that should detract from the movie the movie is a suspense film and it's very good at that so from that stand point this movie rocks <UNK> rocks enjoy to one's plastic hearts content so no complaints for this movie unless you watch the english dub which is a total farce it creates the illusion it's a b movie br br one complaint i do have is the music video on the dvd it doesn't say who sings it i'd love to know br br 8 10 br br quality 10 10 entertainment 10 10 <UNK> 5 10
<START> i <UNK> to the library to check out this miniseries after having just finished listening to the marvelous talking books <UNK> version of the book the first half of this tv version is really very good but it stumbles quite a bit in the second half the relationship with the <UNK> is <UNK> and conflicts are inserted between jean and joe that don't exist in story <UNK> in my opinion as they greatly <UNK> the power of their love story i was disappointed to find that the wonderful bryan <UNK> joe seemed a lot and much less appealing than the man in the book but helen jean was really quite good i think they would have had to make this a 10 hour miniseries to develop the <UNK> story properly but all that said i did watch whole thing in more or less one go and did appreciate its merits all the while wishing that someone would do a less <UNK> remake
<START> it's said that this film is or was banned in the us since it was released since there is no information on imdb i must rely on my other sources and believe it if this is really true the movie is even more <UNK> and frightening and is it is anyway br br the movie is a so called <UNK> although i think the topic is too serious call it like that it creates a scenario where america is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof after an obligatory <UNK> they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park in that they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an american flag posted 50 miles ahead while they're are followed by police and army troops br br the movie itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the and the hunting through the desert filmed by european film <UNK> all the facts are explained the ask questions and film everything people stare directly into the camera shouting at it it seems very very real talking about realism here is nonsense this movie is not about how to make a realistic film it is about how such a film would look like if it was real and it certainly would look like this if it would be filmed anyway in an state like this there surely wouldn't be a european film crew allowed to film those things br br there are many things that <UNK> us the <UNK> are people from all social classes political leaders musicians authors unemployed etc they seem to be hopeless rebellious or scared they are no heroes they talk a lot in the <UNK> knowing it doesn't lead to anything saying nevertheless all they said in speeches and books and songs before one says he's not afraid to die is this true well he doesn't have to run through the desert hunted by cops the <UNK> have no chance or at least their only chance the decision between prison and punishment park is no chance really the way they decide in the end and the way film ends makes it clear that this kind of <UNK> is suicide br br these remind us a lot of in the third <UNK> the officials use the same kind of idealistic ignoring all the arguments from the <UNK> starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet they warn the <UNK> of watching their language and insult them much more they ask them questions the <UNK> can not answer but it's never they should these scenes are a statement about what we call justice br br the scenes in the desert are on a different level when we see the prisoners for the first time we realize that they realize they haven't got a chance seeing the desert and the mountains feeling the sun and the <UNK> they don't have a clue how they should stand this free days the film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to escape this madness they argue should they play the game or escape or revolt it all leads to the same and no one is surprised some will question if such parks would exist in reality in such a state why not it <UNK> the <UNK> and allows the government to <UNK> the <UNK> as they want to it is not a gas chamber but the nazis killed jews before concentration camps were built the comparison is fair since they is no real difference br br the movie is scary and depressing the problems that are talked about sound to familiar to ignore these is not science fiction talking about poverty <UNK> and crime is not <UNK> the film shows us that government and democracy as it is presented to us is not only useless but dangerous it also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution the <UNK> seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight this they do things but for nothing even is this delivers no solution to us it still is a statement br br to me the most frightening thing is the fact of the <UNK> of this movie here we have a film that <UNK> the loss of freedom moral and peace it <UNK> the government a fictional nevertheless to be dangerous and <UNK> and such a film is banned think about it when you see the american flag the next time
<START> a plot that is dumb beyond belief however that said it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare and that is as it should be it isn't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma br br hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna she proves that just because it isn't on the page doesn't mean a role can't be <UNK> and <UNK> into and she does so with gusto good for her br br <UNK> to christine <UNK> who is called upon to be little more than confused and <UNK> but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script br br and to grant show as well a graduate of daytime and prime time <UNK> <UNK> hope <UNK> place he is always versatile and underrated his primary <UNK> seems to be his impossible to ignore good looks he is a <UNK> well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do br br the rest of the cast is basically window dressing br br the direction is adequate and the script as i <UNK> to is fairly idiotic br br watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing it's fun
<START> i went to see this movie with a lady of mine who doesn't like heist movies but she enjoyed it i missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through it is a story about edward norton and a crew stealing some gold and norton deciding he wants it all to himself then the people he betrayed want to get back at him it is a well put together funny and action packed film that i need to see again the whole way through one of my top movies of the summer so far br br a big help to the entertainment factor is seth green i dont know anyone who <UNK> like seth green and he adds to the flavor he plays a guy who says he created and his stole it from him he is a computer <UNK> who is a wonder to watch br br it was said that norton didn't want to do this film but if i were him i would have wanted to sign on br br the only problem is that it is very predictable any movie go er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening before it happens br br my biggest complaint with the film is eddie <UNK> choice of facial hair the thick yet thin mustache and a small <UNK> on his <UNK> he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake
<START> <UNK> focuses on leopold and homosexual relationship a <UNK> of the case that has been mostly and <UNK> ignored since their trial even by leopold himself in his autobiography but even in its treatment of this <UNK> over does it by far worse it twists combines and straight out <UNK> the details of the case which will <UNK> anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it while it is an interestingly made film <UNK> stinks br br 1 out of 10 awful
<START> jay craven's criminally ignored film is a sober breath of fresh air in the generally <UNK> and derivative world of independent film first off the photography is pure aesthetic pleasure capturing all of the gloomy beauty of northern new england in late <UNK> cinematographer paul ryan did 2nd unit on <UNK> days of heaven second the performances are uniformly excellent rip <UNK> is charming and is at once sensitive and <UNK> to say nothing of a fine supporting cast overall though it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively pace while still unfolding in its own time and the film comes to a conclusion natural and genuine that nevertheless does not seem expected this is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world a film that explores a small piece of the <UNK> between humans and history
<START> the plot for black mama white mama revolves around two female inmates at a women's prison in the <UNK> one black and one white these two women are thrown together in the prison pam <UNK> is lee daniels lee is <UNK> in the <UNK> women's prison for dancing as a <UNK> girl br br lee's boyfriend owes her part of his <UNK> from his drug dealing activities lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her drug money so that she can leave the <UNK> and assume a better life margaret <UNK> plays karen brent a white women from a <UNK> background who is also a revolutionary karen has joined a group of <UNK> determined to change the corrupt political system she's captured by authorities and held as a political prisoner br br the story line takes off when karen and lee break out of the prison they were in together the two of them also happened to be <UNK> together at the <UNK> as they flee they also fight with each other because they have different goals to pursue naturally they hate being <UNK> together but they also realize that they must put aside their differences to help each other survive while they <UNK> capture br br if this film seems very similar to the big bird cage it's because much of the cast in the two films is the same as well as their location in the <UNK> roger corman has always had a consistent stable of actors that he used in all of his 70s b movies besides pam <UNK> sid <UNK> <UNK> collins <UNK> <UNK> betty anne <UNK> and william smith were also among the many actors that were frequently cast in <UNK> <UNK> films br br like the big bird cage black mama white mama relies on too much gory violence to be <UNK> pam <UNK> conveys her usual tough chick persona in this film and shows her <UNK> as a female action heroine margaret <UNK> is less effect in her portrayal of the revolutionary karen she just seems to fragile and well <UNK> to be a dedicated political <UNK> except for sid <UNK> as the colorful <UNK> the rest of the cast is forgettable br br this film has little entertainment value unless excessive <UNK> acts of violence are your thing only the performances by pam <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> make this film worth watching
<START> i saw the preview in and thought it could be a cool film turns out it is an awful garbage there isn't much nudity in the film not to mention not having much sex either there were just some dumb and corny dialogues along with some dancing you usually expect to see during audition in our case you may even see it in the actual films conclusion i ain't got none for it just leave it alone
<START> steven seagal is back here with his third film released this year of course as a one time fan who has become increasingly disgruntled i can say it comes as no surprise that this is pretty lame firstly the film made <UNK> because of apparent problems in production due to seagal he would turn up late on set change the script crew etc and generally cause problems for the director don e <UNK> <UNK> his lack of talent his trouble enough this also happens in their second collaboration the upcoming <UNK> which promises to be just as bad as this garbage this also marks a big turning point in <UNK> career because this film is the first of his to really dig out the stock footage there was a little in <UNK> but this film takes the <UNK> they borrow bits from the order a van damme movie <UNK> biggest rival in <UNK> movies no code of conduct <UNK> and also an entire action sequence from the little known peter <UNK> starring vehicle top of the world interestingly the car chase stolen from <UNK> epic made almost 10 years ago and ironically probably cheaper than this garbage is actually by far the best action scene of the film i was shocked enough when dolph lundgren had a brief <UNK> in the stock action video world which thankfully he has escaped from seagal though is the leader of the <UNK> action market currently with van damme and snipes his main rivals seagal still manages to sell movies and for the life of me i don't know how surely the fans must be getting bored of this awfulness longing for a return to the likes of above the law the story here is totally lame in fact the film has so many plot holes it doesn't bare thinking about for example at the end of a film there's a little girl that seagal apparently knows at an <UNK> who he gives a <UNK> to why i don't know but we never see her at all in the rest of the movie or hear her mentioned seagal has a girlfriend in this movie who at the beginning of the film is with a psychic and she becomes haunted by visions which by the end of the film are never explained and mean nothing the film is so ridiculously glued together by a series of meaningless <UNK> that it becomes headache inducing this is by far <UNK> dumbest movie seagal himself is as wooden as ever however to his credit he doesn't get dubbed in this one as far as i could tell seagal does however feel the need to talk like he is a <UNK> <UNK> making me long for the days he would don his brooklyn italian american accent in his classic early films he also has a painfully unfunny double act with who i assume is a <UNK> it is funny how producers seem to think that the <UNK> of seagal plus hip hop star seems to work because his team up with in exit wounds was his most successful film since under siege clearly though if no one has heard of the <UNK> it won't work this is an action film though and so the action itself must be judged unfortunately the action that didn't come form the <UNK> image back <UNK> is strictly routine there are a few small fight scenes with some classic seagal <UNK> but when 90 is performed by his stunt double who really does have a <UNK> work out in this film it really doesn't impress much there are also some standard gun fights which really only have some nice violent and bloody going for them all in all this is a painfully boring experience and once again i'm left giving the same verdict seagal has lost it i keep asking the years old question now why do people still watch his movies that is all very well and good as a question but the sad bastard that i am continues to watch his films in the <UNK> hope he may do something good once again chances are slim unlike <UNK> ever <UNK> <UNK> 1 2
<START> i do not know what today's movie goers expect but after <UNK> years of movie watching well maybe i didn't watch many movies in the first 9 10 years so make that <UNK> years of movie watching i expect to be entertained not bored to tears <UNK> by continuous profanity every other word and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood <UNK> and body parts being <UNK> <UNK> is one of those movies that was made by people who have no imagination little if any talent a total inability to tie scenes together and an <UNK> <UNK> of letting a scene go on and on long after the purpose for it has <UNK> that anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie when it is nothing more that hollywood garbage is beyond me as a combat veteran i have seen violence blood and gore in many forms and movies like we were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get but it has redeeming value <UNK> must have been <UNK> up by persons in a drug induced <UNK> with no writing ability no directorial training no experience in film editing and a total lack of contact with reality just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as fbi agents setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops etc a high <UNK> piece of garbage that only an idiot could like
<START> a quick <UNK> almost nonexistent badly chosen musical soundtrack steady <UNK> filming done without the steady but with lots of coffee and a <UNK> cameraman no plot and nothing ever really happens the film goes from one dialog into another sounding hollow never achieving depth never creating the illusion that you really are inside a <UNK> of conspiracy and the everybody has an affair with everybody is just a boring excuse to show the main actress in nice underwear which combined with her rusty voice certainly is nice but nothing to base a movie on the high point for me is the opening scene and the film just <UNK> from there to a point where i just wanted to quit the film about 45 minutes into the story i regret sitting it out
<START> dirty war br br aspect ratio 1 <UNK> 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br <UNK> services struggle to cope when <UNK> terrorists <UNK> a so called <UNK> in the middle of london br br daniel frightening movie uses all available evidence to <UNK> the possible effects of a <UNK> explosion in the heart of the uk capital using the kind of documentary style realism which has distinguished this particular <UNK> since the 1960's in essence the film reveals a <UNK> of flaws in the british <UNK> current <UNK> for dealing with such terrorist <UNK> and carefully <UNK> script co written by <UNK> <UNK> its <UNK> against <UNK> mouthed politicians who would rather maintain the economic status <UNK> than tackle this issue head on the film covers all necessary <UNK> and makes the <UNK> point that this kind of terrorism is <UNK> by a tiny handful of fanatics who have <UNK> the <UNK> faith with their reckless disregard for human life though viewers won't be <UNK> by the subsequent scenes of <UNK> and horror not merely a drama the film acts as a warning against <UNK> either that or its just another post 9 11 <UNK> you be the judge

<START> and call really did nothing why are they hero's they did nothing other then get to places after the bad guys where dead what was the point of this show i was very very disappointed i expected more action more story and to see the birth of <UNK> and great deeds instead i saw very little it seemed like and call where just side story's for the great indian chief br br i'm not even sure that the history is even very close they did very little to show why the <UNK> and <UNK> fought against each other br br the only good part about this movie was who played gus very very well and is a great actor a lot of good story that could have been gone to waste it was sad and i wish that i had not watched it

<START> i'm currently <UNK> through <UNK> and decline of the roman empire so i've had all things roman on my mind i'm not very far into it yet maybe two hundred plus pages but it is amazing just how many of these roman were killed i believe i've read through maybe 15 so far and only <UNK> and haven't been killed or at least suspected of having been killed i have also been fascinated by the mad <UNK> of many of these <UNK> of rome not the least <UNK> of these was <UNK> this brings me to reviewing this film i'm thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as i understand it from explanation of rome as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels <UNK> with the period br br my point is i do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it's i do not think the <UNK> shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate the general ideas of the film seem accurate <UNK> is raised on an island <UNK> with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad suspicious and strange emperor he grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the <UNK> <UNK> given him by his guards little boots this helps him grow up feeling abused and <UNK> he is handed the empire after dies the <UNK> hoping he will steer away from the informer <UNK> which brought death by <UNK> of the former paranoid <UNK> and lead rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into <UNK> begins as a decent if hands off emperor but gets sick almost dies and comes back from the brink of death a true monster his with his sisters do begin here if not before he does have <UNK> killed and many others who were his originally supporters the acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of <UNK> as much as his new thinking of himself as a living god him seen talking to the statue of <UNK> as an equal doomed him his violent mad <UNK> would have doomed him anyway and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the <UNK> of well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent which is not common through it's entirety it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the <UNK> of ancient rome the shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails it is just too much to see <UNK> <UNK> have man after man murdered raped tortured for no reason but fancy the depictions of the violence are possibly but not probably accurate murder certainly was the order of the day in <UNK> rome torture beforehand was <UNK> but the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists while the <UNK> watch with <UNK> i just don't see it having gone down exactly like that the death machine the is certainly something like you've never seen in movies and something once seen you shall probably never forget even as i you wish you could the wine drinking while the penis is <UNK> off is the same once you've seen this shame it is yours forever these things strike me the director's and that porn <UNK> fantasies they <UNK> from their sick <UNK> and not from any proved record br br the acting is pretty good i actually think mcdowell is the weakest link here <UNK> is always something to behold and here in her youthful years she is <UNK> and beautiful the portrayals of and are done very well by their respected actors the film could have done so much better story telling it is such a failure that way its just a whole other <UNK> of what a shame this thing was for example it could have given opinion on how and why <UNK> went mad or shown that he was mad paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously it could have shown the weakness of <UNK> and the miracle it was he survived <UNK> it could have these and many other things but it stuck to it's sad nightmares br br finally about the sex it is porn it shows these sex acts being done all over the <UNK> by many people male on male female on female male on female it is <UNK> disgusting sex sex that if your point is to get off on it i seriously doubt you could both and <UNK> may have been sex <UNK> and <UNK> may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a greek time than a roman i don't think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or <UNK> right out in the open were common until the the strange <UNK> reign of and he was killed for it br br this film should probably never be watched if your curious about it let it go it is something as i said earlier if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it's sick visions in your minds eye for years to come i don't think its an accurate historical picture in particular even if it is historical in whole
<START> <UNK> beautiful this movie <UNK> the <UNK> bad it's <UNK> genre of films br br the only two talents in it are richard <UNK> and joan van <UNK> and only <UNK> is any good it's kind of sad that the man who rose to fame as should wind up in this ugly pile of celluloid while he turns in a fantastic performance i couldn't help but feel that he so <UNK> all his fellow actors in this piece that he shouldn't even have been there br br the effects in this film are laughable but fun the idea of a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming to life is b movie gold when the gets killed watch how it falls it's clear that the stunt performer in the front of the costume knows the timing best he falls to the ground well before the back half of the dinosaur follows suit br br speaking of there is nothing good to say about the purple <UNK> in this flick it seems to have some kind of stealth technology since <UNK> to be the best <UNK> in the world twice fails to notice it until it's within biting range of him i don't know how all the <UNK> are but in the version i own the <UNK> contains <UNK> trademark <UNK> br br this is loads of fun to watch if you like bad movies i love them and especially bad monster movies so i consider this the gem of my collection if bad movies are your thing definitely get this one
<START> i just saw princess <UNK> at the asian film festival in new york the gentleman who introduced the film <UNK> the audience on their fine taste you could be at <UNK> fully loaded he said with a smug smile but instead you're here to watch <UNK> <UNK> princess <UNK> the audience <UNK> and <UNK> well let me tell you i would have rather watched <UNK> fully loaded twice in a row princess <UNK> an allegedly whimsical musical based on japanese <UNK> easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films that i have ever seen it is so wretched that its <UNK> actually makes me dislike other <UNK> <UNK> films which is quite a feat br br there is such a vast <UNK> of things wrong with princess <UNK> that i hardly know where to start perhaps its worst faults are being both <UNK> <UNK> and mind <UNK> monotonous if the <UNK> got mixed up or if half of them got lost in <UNK> the audience would not know the difference if you don't believe me i dare you to steal a print and have someone run the <UNK> in random order if you can tell me which one goes where i will give you every penny i have br br the first third of the film features a <UNK> of scenes songs including a cringe inducing rap number and images that don't seem to be related in any way at all horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the bargain adding yet another brick to the immense and rapidly growing wall of <UNK> it wouldn't surprise me to learn that the writer wrote down any japanese <UNK> that came to mind of on a bunch of note cards <UNK> them up <UNK> them dealt the cards out on a table and then wrote the script according to their order br br about thirty five minutes into the film some semblance of a plot arrives on the scene something about a shape shifting <UNK> princess in human form and a regular human falling in love i hoped that this was be a <UNK> of the film being something other than a series of <UNK> scenes but no such luck the film continues in the same absolutely <UNK> manner i wish i had gotten out then but i was trapped in the middle of a narrow row in retrospect it would have been worth the awkward scene br br i'm exhausted just thinking about the last couple of <UNK> i spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over every big <UNK> move <UNK> in music or scene that looked remotely like it was <UNK> things <UNK> my hopes that the credits were about to roll for <UNK> minute after <UNK> minute it went on and on and on and on finally after dozens of false <UNK> it cut to what i was sure must be an abstract pattern over which credits were about to appear then in <UNK> of all reason it cut to another scene how could i forget the completely unrelated subplot concerning a ninja being captured on and boiled in a soup hadn't been wrapped up yet br br i'm never going to get those <UNK> minutes back but you can spare yourself the pain unless you want to <UNK> your memory or future enjoyment of great <UNK> <UNK> films like youth of the beast and tokyo drifter do not see princess <UNK> i would have rather spent my time <UNK>
<START> a young woman jodie foster is witnessing a mafia murder reports the killing to the local police and becomes herself a hit target by the mob <UNK> a professional killer dennis hopper hired by mafia is stalking her to prepare for the hit but eventually he falls for her then as a parody of the <UNK> syndrome that <UNK> a case when an <UNK> hostage begins to like and <UNK> with the <UNK> jodie foster falls for her <UNK> too make love and both prepare for a <UNK> br br denis hopper the actor tries to <UNK> himself with the creative ambitions of dennis hopper the director the result is disappointing and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as dennis hopper is there is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable the film is saved to some extent by the performance of jodie foster who is not at her best but still shines with her talent beauty and gift of historical interest is the short appearance of vincent price and in a small act of charlie known from his great part in wall street br br if you decide to spend the <UNK> minutes to see the film it is not a complete loss this movie offers easy entertainment but we would expect much more from the director of easy rider and the actress who gave us the character of sarah <UNK> in the accused
<START> good movie all elements of a good movie was there story actors script and direction i was on the edge of my seat the whole time br br no question about it is a low budget film but i liked it more than many big budget films br br <UNK> plays martin sanders who is dealing with his <UNK> wife then a voice in the <UNK> and then just fear br br virginia <UNK> is beautiful and brings a powerful performance she is an excellent part to the film br br i liked the increasing ambiguity near the end even though we know that the main character can be involved we continued seeing everything from his point of view and asking who is the killer
<START> this film ain't half bad it may be a little long at times but carried along by beautiful scenery an immensely beautiful love letter and great actors you forget time and enjoy the grand prize however goes to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as well that would be telling but they are just great
<START> for people like me who were born long after the '60s ended we can only learn about the era through cultural <UNK> of which hair is one this is certainly a well done tour de force one can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture probably the most impressive scene for me at least is when the group crashes the rich people's party as for the movie's final scene one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the '60s represented br br but no matter how one <UNK> this movie it's important to understand that even though the '60s themselves may have ended the movements that <UNK> them still exist in small it's a time that people won't soon forget br br anyway this movie is one that i definitely recommend <UNK> <UNK> scored another great one here right between his two masterpieces one flew over the <UNK> nest and <UNK> so why did he later make a piece of crap like man on the moon starring john savage treat williams and beverly <UNK>
<START> i saw this fine flick shortly leaving college as i sat there happily watching alice go from repressed virgin to sexual <UNK> i got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar then i remembered intro <UNK> 101 lecture one of the <UNK> dealt with the psycho sexual stages of basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant <UNK> gets our main attention as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure <UNK> first encounter is being <UNK> with emphasis on the <UNK> and bottom her next encounter is an <UNK> one with the mad <UNK> <UNK> i forget the rest of the lecture and the order of <UNK> encounters but i do remember how well they matched it's interesting to see a skin flick with some brains behind it rather than the cliche i'm here to deliver your pizza let's screw br br i don't see how <UNK> career could be <UNK> by this film as it was her first film and <UNK> tiresome <UNK> had yet to <UNK> this land when it was released but in a way he and his <UNK> did affect ms <UNK> when was staging his anti pornography <UNK> to distract people from his own criminal activities hired the services of an anti porn <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography she saw the alice cover ms <UNK> did for playboy and promptly announced she had <UNK> <UNK> that ms <UNK> was in fact a photo <UNK> of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old yeah right
<START> yes bad acting isn't only one thing to mention bad script not so bad music unfortunately br br nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too br br first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea to have some fun smiling br br they find everything in the sea i mean things like fishing net knife <UNK> dive things <UNK> <UNK> husband br br stuff are you kidding stupid they are so happy on the island they are going to die and they are happy love peace love just stupid br br terrible skip this one please
<START> i've tried to <UNK> why so many bad reviews of this film while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10 the reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review although a few have done that quite nicely already this film is confusing depressing and doesn't have a happy ending i still gave x a rating of 10 because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film that is really my favorite kind of filmmaking i've only seen two of <UNK> films this one and sang as with this film i'm being somewhat pretentious when i call this one of <UNK> best films but i am <UNK> has a <UNK> style if that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring then it would be best not to watch this but x was less <UNK> than sang so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller at least for my taste i found it quite interesting and absorbing the two lead roles did an excellent job acting i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister catherine d is always great but her role was not very large or significant in the story but everyone did a fine job i thought the cult stuff was great it may have not been very believable but that is due to its being rather abstract there is a lot going on between the lines in this film this is a very <UNK> psycho thriller

<START> <UNK> action cheesy love story unexpected actors and overall great fun the special effect are acceptable decent some of the fighting is kinda neat with some interesting <UNK> moves the overall story moves along and is cheesy enough to keep you wondering when the inevitable is going to happen although there is a bit of a twist just a small one the overall <UNK> of the movie make it quite whimsical at times cute enough chicks too what more could you want ps if you're gonna review a movie like this try to review it in terms of the category the movie would fall not necessarily where it was intended to fall ie don't bomb out good cheesy movies
<START> the twins effect chinese action comedy <UNK> <UNK> gillian <UNK> br br this vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that i was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie first of all the characters are memorable <UNK> a <UNK> of classic scenes <UNK> and gillian are naturally cute charismatic and humorous this movie was my first exposure to them and all i wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them a really big hug the remaining cast did well in their supporting roles including jackie chan karen <UNK> the duke <UNK> ho edison <UNK> anthony wong and the vampire bad guys one of which looks <UNK> familiar to will ferrell even the <UNK> horrible <UNK> <UNK> was good in this one good characters are important of course because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences br br and speaking of action this film has plenty of it more importantly there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography one aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists  a sword with a <UNK> <UNK> ended rope this weapon in and of itself opened up a variety of moves that would have been otherwise impossible <UNK> ho and gillian <UNK> in particular perform some wicked <UNK> <UNK> using these devices br br in addition the <UNK> is superb and is <UNK> by two great sword fights  one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale in fact the blade wielding <UNK> <UNK> in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorites to great shame and i truly feel sorry for those who would <UNK> the horribly choreographed garbage seen in <UNK> of time storm riders or a man called hero with the well planned precisely executed sequences seen in the twins effect it's not even close br br i can't understand why this film gets so much criticism i'm sure die hard <UNK> for the hong kong golden age will hate this because it doesn't fit into their narrow minded view of what hong kong action should be we should learn from the downfall of john woo a one trick <UNK> who never learned how to re <UNK> himself we don't need another clone we need something different the twins effect is one good example br br this film was so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other chinese movies with the same actors and actresses this especially applies to <UNK> <UNK> whose other films almost always suck  and yes this includes the <UNK> overrated and exploitative <UNK> crap mentioned in the previous paragraph even the twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actresses in a film although they have managed to hit some good films when either one or the other takes the leading role e g beyond our ken good times bed times house of fury or when one or both are in supporting roles e g colour of the truth new police story just one look the twins effect 2 should have been a direct sequel instead of a family fantasy i am still yearning to see <UNK> and gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie but the fact remains that the twins effect hits on all <UNK> their charisma while avoiding a descent into annoyance as in <UNK> de la rose <UNK> br br all in all this film has everything one needs to be entertained and may i remind the reader that it is precisely this  entertainment  that judges the greatness of a movie more so than artsy dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established <UNK> of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about br br in the end the twins effect is a classic not to be missed br br rating 5 5 stars br br p s  the hollywood <UNK> decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the u s by <UNK> it the vampire effect and cutting out 20 minutes of footage which includes parts of the action scenes however the final fight of the u s version does have a better soundtrack than the original version therefore i purchased both versions which allows me to first watch the original until about the 1 20 mark and then <UNK> <UNK> to watch the final fight on the u s version
<START> like the previous poster i am from northern <UNK> and i was inclined to like this film however not since red zone cuba have i seen such a confusing plot the things the people to <UNK> make no sense two of the gang <UNK> across the border send a second party across in a car <UNK> why then they meet two others and drive up at night in to the bad guy's <UNK> in a luxury <UNK> wouldn't just two people in a truck make more sense then <UNK> outside the garage that holds the targeted <UNK> the four fall asleep when they in the morning and and start <UNK> the <UNK> out of course they're spotted and shot at losing some of their precious <UNK> in the process then two of the <UNK> put the <UNK> in a boat and <UNK> it over the border again why i am told by someone whose great uncle really did <UNK> in the area all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could <UNK> than the u s canada border <UNK> which back then had a <UNK> of the resources it has now br br and don't get me started on the last half hour which made no sense whatsoever br br the only good thing i can say about the film is that kris <UNK> has actually grown some charisma with the years
<START> from what i understand fox was embarrassed they released a pg 13 alien predator movie not so long ago it was not well received by any means br br not exactly sure where to go next seeing as they thought anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci fi gem fox turned to it's small but <UNK> group of monkeys for answers br br these monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci fi flicks but had seen <UNK> planet of the apes remake and house of the dead br br their first task hire actors fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money they hired fifteen tv actors shortly after br br now the script the monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves leaving out important aspects of the two <UNK> was the easy part thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line that was more difficult they <UNK> heads awhile and came up with a truly award winning screenplay <UNK> with cliché characters idiotic decisions an <UNK> plot holes br br fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the to the film the aliens and <UNK> the monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great <UNK> used in the otherwise terrible original and go with the man in the suit alien seen in the old films the actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they their plastic heads throughout the film with honor as for the <UNK> the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around again saving budget to fight the <UNK> of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere br br but what about the effects you ask come on now people they may be monkeys but they clearly knew cgi would play a key role in the film without diving into the budget the monkeys used a standard final cut program and cut and <UNK> some very nice fire and spark effects throughout putting red and green <UNK> over the camera lens provided some excellent predator visions br br the setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about if this was to be on earth in <UNK> of all places they needed to make it realistic this was where they admitted they might have made a mistake see the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do they simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film to add insult to injury the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was but again rookie mistake br br the rating fox told the monkeys to make the movie r rated that was easy without showing how many of the <UNK> or deaths actually happened the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact it was simple the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence br br some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay why does a blue <UNK> the predator has endless amounts of magically <UNK> whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that why is an ex convict driving around in a police car the entire movie why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the aliens why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters the list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece br br fox was thrilled with their work so thrilled that they opened the movie <UNK> on christmas day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out the monkeys had successfully made another installment in these <UNK> <UNK> br br but some ask what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use they put it towards their next film aliens vs predator vs hulk hogan they knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement br br to the people do not worry about our upcoming film it will be rated r and will have violence br br and everyone lived happily ever after the end
<START> i saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago i've seen it 4 more times since i had never heard of it before and i consider myself <UNK> of classic cinema a true polished diamond in the rough br br this gem of a movie revolves around jon voight lead character as a young <UNK> assigned to island to teach the children all in one school at first the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home the heart of the movie is finding inspiration to <UNK> their young minds to the world around them the students quickly reward their teacher with an <UNK> to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that only a short time before had been foreign to them uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be oh a little fun god <UNK> learning and fun together can't be or so says the ones in charge to avoid a spoiler i shall just say that finds resistance with the boss man and the ending is truly bittersweet br br i am a 35 year old white male with some teaching experience so i should identify with the lead character pat <UNK> aka mr but i don't i identify with the black kids as a kid i was to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the <UNK> grade circa 1979 these kids in the movie remind me of my classmates then luckily in 4th grade as a 8 or 9 year old one doesn't understand racism i just remember we were all being kids playing 4 square hide and seek and running <UNK> br br this movie is very moving there are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end non stop i found myself many times with tears in my eyes then suddenly laughing out loud it's a funny movie br br <UNK> away from that sir if you're prepared to accept crap i should tell you that rabbit just did it in your lap so you the white <UNK> mr my love mr you a good looking teacher you a good looking white man wind 15 <UNK> from the east small boat warning small <UNK> beware big <UNK> ok don't gotta worry <UNK> nothing not a <UNK> cook but <UNK> <UNK> not a share <UNK> but something latin that's latin hey wait sing like a frog i sing good <UNK> <UNK> br br it still <UNK> me that i still hear nothing about this movie or that it has very little reputation or following i intend to seek out more reviews comments background and making of <UNK> if they are out there what <UNK> me is the acting given from the <UNK> kids one of the kids mary i understand was an actress and you can tell however the other kids have plenty of lines and genuine reactions i wonder how they did it i'm guessing that and mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the scenes unfold naturally or ad <UNK> br br is a special movie in my opinion it is one of the very few movies that are so good and so unknown others in that category are king rat <UNK> dark passage <UNK> with <UNK> and bacall gods must be crazy <UNK> and bad day at black rock <UNK> i recommend them all but first take a seat in the class of mr
<START> story about three <UNK> maybe even <UNK> ha children beginning their love for murder oh and the people who are hot on their trail br br bloody birthday a pretty mediocre title for the film was a nice <UNK> surprise i was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood <UNK> psychopath kids and i may say it's also one of the best flicks i've seen with kids as the villains by the end of the movie i seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion br br it's a really solid 80s horror flick but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you can't not think about even the slightest bit of investigation would easily <UNK> these <UNK> sh <UNK> as the murderers but there seems to be only a couple police in town well by the end only one and he seemed like a <UNK> so i suppose they could have gotten away with it haha yeah and i'm a chinese jet pilot br br nevertheless this movie delivered some kids who were more than entertaining a lot of <UNK> sex and a decent amount of <UNK> no if you're put off by the less than stellar title dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot it's a very <UNK> and underrated 80s horror flick
<START> if you've never experienced the thing that is <UNK> <UNK> here is a <UNK> <UNK> in 1933 mae <UNK> <UNK> voice for the character <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sue does her best <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> walking around whining and <UNK> her hands or <UNK> herself to the <UNK> i kept waiting for her to say <UNK> but instead it's something always happens to somebody the first time i saw this film i loved <UNK> and found her character really funny i've since seen her in other films where she does this same whining uptight fragile flower routine so upon watching this film again i started getting a little annoyed with the constant whining and near <UNK> over a piece of dust but there are some funny comedy bits here and it's also a mystery movie as well it's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works the mystery plot holds together well through the camp of <UNK> <UNK> and james <UNK> who plays arthur the policeman the haunted house is fun with many a secret passage and even a <UNK> in the attic well worth the watch read more public <UNK> movie reviews at http <UNK> com
<START> most movies from hollywood seem to follow one of a few pre <UNK> and very predictable plots this film does not and is a perfect example of what i watch <UNK> for br br there's a guy michael and his girlfriend left him with out a word he wants to know what happened is she ok can he say goodbye perhaps get some closure he hasn't been able to contact grace and in an effort to find her he has made a film asking for your help br br michael figures we might need a reason to help him so he tells us his story by <UNK> his relationship with the help of a friend <UNK> to play the role of grace the girlfriend who left br br <UNK> sight is 20 20 and it is no different for michael by telling his story and getting <UNK> from his friends he realizes his mistakes and just how much he values what he has lost this is unfortunately a lesson we all have had to learn or need to learn and is easy to identify with that is what makes you want to hear more of michael's story and wanting to know if he finds grace
<START> i have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on mystery science theater have received a tons of low ratings on imdb however a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the <UNK> treatment with the <UNK> making funny comments during the film now i am not saying that the girl in <UNK> lane is a great film but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current imdb score of 2 1 br br the film begins with and danny meeting is a veteran drifter and danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to be wandering about the country once they blow into a small town needs to rescue danny again and again because danny is quite naive a nice way of saying he has the intellect of a <UNK> br br along the way something happens to the self assured he finds a nice young lady and finds the lure of staying put pulling at him and in an odd subplot jack <UNK> plays a super creepy <UNK> who wanders the town <UNK> the crap out of everyone yet oddly the police don't seem to take much notice nor does anyone on their own do anything about him ultimately however when <UNK> puts the moves on a girl who is falling for things come to a full <UNK> br br overall while not at all a great film there were many interesting plot elements in this film enough to merit a score higher than 2 1 the biggest <UNK> are a simplistic conclusion to the mystery that occurs near the end as well as the total stupidity of danny one time too often considering the <UNK> budget however it's a watchable little film
<START> ok i got the dvd set last week and i am finally getting around to <UNK> my reviews but i sure liked this sequel in many ways br br zombie bloodbath 2 rage of the undead ok this one movies at a fast clip has some really good gore effects and some really well done atmosphere and style i would actually go on record as saying this may be one of the most stylish <UNK> shot flicks that i have bought most of the time i get rather angry at <UNK> movies for being boring and looking like soap operas even a movie like bone sickness that i like has incredible stretches of dull not this movie it never stops long enough to let you catch your breath although i wouldn't say i liked it better than the first film i will say that sheets certainly improved technically in the two years in between films this one has better gore the inevitable zombie feeding scenes <UNK> characters and a few returning actors although their roles are different mainly jerry <UNK> as a pretty good psychopath with a killer <UNK> from hell the shots are more ambitious as well as the script this time around because you can tell sheets is trying to pull a lot more off than he did in the first film some of it works and some of it doesn't but i have to say that at least he wasn't just trying to do a larger version of the first film there was no mention this time around of a power plant of chemical just <UNK> and the occult that brings the undead back to life so i say kudos to mr sheets for trying to do something different with this one i give this film two bloody thumbs up
<START> for those of you still in the dark i will not spoil this christie as it is definitely one of her finest works and i stress that you should see it whenever you next have free time if any of the adaptations are to be watched before or in <UNK> of reading the book i would suggest after the funeral for the following reasons br br i wanted to praise the performance by monica <UNK> miss <UNK> whose <UNK> companion <UNK> is brutally murdered at the outset of the film her portrayal of a shocked nervous insignificant woman is actually moving especially when she has a moment of personal connection with <UNK> another person who travels alone in the journey of life and when the murderer is being revealed in typical <UNK> denouement fashion reactions to the revelation are acting at its finest you feel as angry at the murderer as you do sympathetic to miss <UNK> something <UNK> in christie <UNK> br br although there are a couple of <UNK> between novel and film adaptation as per usual the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film the unbelievably lavish recreation of post war england thoroughly high <UNK> of acting and directing and <UNK> if not <UNK> of <UNK> mystery and intrigue render these <UNK> insignificant br br bravo <UNK> <UNK> and the whole team for <UNK> this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre and the producers who gave it the green light <UNK>
<START> stephanie meyer is going to be so <UNK> now her book breaking dawn will not be first with that title sorry twilight fans br br kelly the ring two is medical student eve who is assigned to interview psychotic don james <UNK> angelina <UNK> brother i suspected the twist and when she found out they both grew up in the same town i was sure of it br br she kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that i felt there was a shared <UNK> going on at times she even acted like she had <UNK> i really thought she was losing it br br well she wasn't losing it and when the end came i was <UNK> my whole suspicion turned out to be wrong the twist was even more amazing than i believed br br was fantastic and the story is so much better than something stephanie meyer would come up with a must see
<START> a romp across a <UNK> <UNK> this adventure <UNK> through it's downright comedy from the <UNK> confrontation of cultural <UNK> as drama from crisis perhaps a little too <UNK> for some i would love to have watched in a cinema audience in the <UNK> shockingly good
<START> a potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth hurt has about as much menace as a <UNK> bunny and <UNK> can't seem to decide whether he's playing an ex london crook or some straight off the playing fields at <UNK> as for poor laura del <UNK> she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern idea of the stereotypical latino woman who's all <UNK> and hot <UNK> if you're a fan of any of the main actors don't disappoint yourself or fool yourself as i suspect many of the other <UNK> here have done watch it by all means but stay critical you know these guys can do better
<START> the feature length cgi movie has just been released this year but whilst it will provide kids a lot of entertainment for die hard alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60s and 80s versions of the cartoon shows the <UNK> adventure is probably the best alvin and the <UNK> based animated movie ever br br for starters the animation is as ever terrific the character designs are as they should be in the cartoons unlike the motion picture film itself it is just sheer fun to watch there are no <UNK> voices no cgi generated effects just pure quality 2 d hand drawn animation and the colours are fantastic bright bold and beautiful the jokes and humour is typical <UNK> standard and the narrative is spot on in truth the <UNK> adventure is everything the live action movie ought to have been but isn't alvin simon and theodore compete with the <UNK> and britney in a hot air balloon contest and along the way the kids encounter all manner of problems and <UNK> that they have to resolve in their own way and no <UNK> movie is complete without the odd <UNK> of classic rock and pop <UNK> br br the <UNK> adventure is for kids and adults alike which is another advantage over the cgi movie as whereas the 2007 version will gain a few new <UNK> the 1987 movie will appeal to both young and older <UNK> fans and provide the <UNK> like voices of the film's trio br br overall this film is a must for fans of the cartoon shows themselves you will not be left disappointed if you have seen the live action version then you'll feel that this movie is a much better effort in contrast if you haven't then you should go and see it still or even still forget the jason lee movie and as an alternative stick with this
<START> <UNK> scott does what he does best i e plays a worm in danger <UNK> a 1945 b movie also starring faye <UNK> <UNK> freeman and <UNK> <UNK> scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money on the <UNK> from his last murder he <UNK> a room in the home owned by the family <UNK> <UNK> and her mother mary scott throws himself at <UNK> and she's <UNK> mid romance her younger sister anne freeman comes home from a medical treatment when she mentions that she was uncle favorite and he left her 25 000 big bucks by 1945 standards scott loses interest in poor <UNK> and makes a play for anne anne looks like rebecca of <UNK> farm until she starts <UNK> around with scott overnight she ages 10 years and becomes downright nasty to her sister finally getting the message that her tenant is no good <UNK> calls in a psychiatrist <UNK> <UNK> to psyche him out and advise her br br psychological dramas were all the rage during and after world war ii and scott does an excellent job as a smooth <UNK> this was his <UNK> as a weak <UNK> sheriff in <UNK> road he <UNK> no real presence as for two timing we saw him do that in mildred pierce where he proved himself particularly good at it <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> with her hair pushed off her face and her big glasses but after hours she's lovely and gives a strong performance <UNK> was always an underrated actress here she sports a soft german accent and is delightful br br this is a highly entertaining film though a very routine story the acting truly <UNK> it
<START> camp blood looked great when i was buying it but when i watched it boy was i wrong its tacky the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking being a movie fan i usually find humour from tragic horror but at times i couldn't even laugh maybe camp blood 2 will be an improvement
<START> what is it about certain films that <UNK> such polar opposite reactions br br some people here have called high roller disgusting some have called it extraordinary as would i actually br br why i think it's because films like this don't make heroes out of <UNK> or <UNK> out of <UNK> and some people just can't deal with that emotionally they need a hero and i'd also add that if they're <UNK> or poker players they might feel personally betrayed when their existence isn't justified br br high roller in not a poker movie it's a people movie it's not perfect but it looks good is well written and wonderfully acted and best of all it <UNK> an emotional response and <UNK> reflection br br and maybe that's what makes some people so damn mad
<START> the <UNK> runner is one of the most controversial films of the year and it's not just one of those <UNK> invented by <UNK> people to sell tickets no this is a film that was actually pulled from release because the producers began to fear for their safety of their actors that may give you an idea of just how sensitive and <UNK> some of the material is the <UNK> runner is an important film for our modern world because now more than ever we need stories that show the reality of war not just action movies that <UNK> the violence it was adapted from the best selling book and some critics have charged that something was lost in translation but if you don't bring the <UNK> of the novel into the screening you will be very moved
<START> one of the more obscure of anthony <UNK> westerns the last frontier was also his only <UNK> western aside from one brief episode in winchester '73 though naturally he focuses on the <UNK> and internal conflicts rather than offering a <UNK> celebration of <UNK> and shared ideals set not in his beloved high country but in the <UNK> and <UNK> it's a much more cynical view of life of the frontier in many ways his <UNK> <UNK> without the need to <UNK> the legend this <UNK> is made up of <UNK> failures <UNK> and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors badly led while the civil war takes <UNK> and all the best the army has to offer br br victor mature and james <UNK> are the free who find <UNK> <UNK> up on them when they are <UNK> of their <UNK> and by a local tribe <UNK> by the <UNK> of the <UNK> into their territory rather than blame the indians for their <UNK> they decide it's the <UNK> fault for building the <UNK> and decide to demand <UNK> from them ending up joining their ranks as <UNK> instead but despite the best efforts of guy <UNK> <UNK> and competent acting commander to bring mature into the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform the arrival of robert <UNK> <UNK> colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own <UNK>  and <UNK> clumsy <UNK> with the <UNK> wife anne <UNK> too much of a blank <UNK> here to do much with the role of a woman who's tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her  soon drive matters into much darker territory it's not long before some of the soldiers are planning on killing each other both sides trying to <UNK> their <UNK> into doing the deed for them little wonder that at one point mature throws away the he has long <UNK> in disgust screaming i would have died for this but it's nothing but a dirty filthy blue <UNK> the stallone of his day mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director this is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part <UNK> enough as a simple man  well meaning but drunk violent <UNK> and with a <UNK> almost <UNK> lust for life the part seems designed with burt <UNK> in mind with some striking similarities to his character in the but robert <UNK> <UNK> like colonel is clearly the best role determined to <UNK> the career he destroyed in a single <UNK> <UNK> civil war engagement by <UNK> another pointless <UNK> campaign against the tribe that added another <UNK> to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board in his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife's sympathy as by the promotion of former <UNK> he regards as his <UNK> he's beyond salvation but there's still a <UNK> human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity  he genuinely <UNK> <UNK> courage in making a <UNK> attempt to get <UNK> orders by their superiors  <UNK> <UNK> though it is br br like its hero the film is a little rough around the edges and boasts one of the most surreal and <UNK> title songs of any western but that only tends to make it more interesting and there are plenty of <UNK> typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive unfortunately the <UNK> of the early <UNK> <UNK> are very apparent in <UNK> dvd with the image often dark 2 <UNK> 1 <UNK> required a huge amount of additional lighting and early scope films show a lot of trial and error and grainy
<START> ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist this is one of them this is a terrible attempt to parody the godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and bad dialogue eddie is just plain annoying as tony an annoying <UNK> who upon his father don william <UNK> 's request takes over the family business tony as i said is an annoying little <UNK> this makes the whole movie a complete mess the movie is terribly <UNK> it's too cartoonish the main point i'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like the godfather with so much <UNK> it doesn't work that way believe it or not you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously if you don't take it seriously it will feel too much like a parody the thing about doing a parody is that you can't seem too much like you're doing a parody you have to make it seem like you're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously it also feels like they're just mocking woody allen and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible
<START> i've seen comments from turkish people which i'm not saying this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays turkish life all i have to say is turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world because in my opinion that is exactly what this movie was to me if i were turkish i think it would have had a greater impact but if you're not from turkey i would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on this br br distant seems to <UNK> on forever many scenes are <UNK> long with little or no purpose i don't understand the director's <UNK> in even including many of the scenes it is pointed out that the director used his own car apartment and friends in making the movie well guess what it shows it looks low budget the acting is poor if it's a cultural thing then so be it i just don't understand the purpose of <UNK> a movie on this story it's unbelievably boring
<START> overall i'd call this a disappointing performance it attempts the old horror anthology approach but fails miserably the acting was bad and so were the stories any skin shown in the movie was obviously random just to attract the r rating for sex typical i guess but bad nonetheless take your 5 and rent a real movie instead
<START> i haven't laughed this hard since <UNK> got caught in the <UNK> says one of the <UNK> in this hilarious quasi spoof of all those val <UNK> and george a romero walking dead movies we have come to love or <UNK> depending on your personal taste through the years br br in this story a young actor pair play a <UNK> prank on the rest of their <UNK> after one spooky night they visit a cemetery island their artistic director alan pretends to bring the dead back to life by <UNK> a highly stylized ritual br br way too much screen time is <UNK> the amateur dialog includes lame <UNK> melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler <UNK> and can't alan stop that irritating laughter way too much once the action kicks in which comes close to the end of this film it's worth the wait br br i saw this one on a late night local station television program that ran films very much like this one only this one scared me at the age of 13 but then again you might laugh your way through it until the bitter end which is probably the reason nowadays why very few people still wear <UNK> hip <UNK>
<START> this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is so much at the house that goes wrong that would not happen it isn't even funny granted this is a movie meaning things that won't happen in normal life happen here however this movie is more far fetched than theories that no child left behind is working all of these people are in the house and nobody has noticed another not to mention the damn owl that seems to be coming everywhere but in its cage i could deal with an owl joke the first few times but after an hour i just can't take it i would rather kill myself than see that damn owl again did i laugh during this movie no not even once no horrible horrible horrible the fact that this pile of garbage is <UNK> off with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his boss over and taking his pants off in front of everybody just makes this movie ever worse but wait the day is saved because the damn owl can fly wow amazing however i do give this movie some <UNK> its not as bad as epic movie
<START> after the atomic bomb hits <UNK> <UNK> bodies lie all around <UNK> victims attempt to communicate with relatives who can't even recognize them and one person after another dies of radiation sickness this black and white film however sad and scary is not without humor the story revolves around a young woman who was hit by black rain after the explosion she is trying to get married but everyone keeps dying and people are worried the same will happen to her after finding a suitable mate who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness this film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on japan it will <UNK> you and will perhaps make you cry the acting is good not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made
<START> in a lonely road in cape <UNK> a black man driving a car is chased and hit by a truck falling off road and dying his daughter cassie robinson calls her former boyfriend dean and asks him to investigate the mysterious accident sam and dean see that three <UNK> americans and the <UNK> major of the town were killed in weird <UNK> on the same road when the truck threatens cassie her <UNK> mother mrs robinson tells a tragic racist murder that happened thirty years ago and the brothers realize that they have to fight against a hatred spirit in a ghost truck br br in this episode dean <UNK> his first and unique love to his brother surprising sam and showing that he has feelings but also that his hunting wish is stronger than his love the story is only reasonable touching in the delicate theme of racism in an efficient manner and <UNK> it with a supernatural event my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> route <UNK>
<START> this movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny i found this movie to be one of the most boring slow paced early 80's movies that i have ever seen i like most 80's cheap horror movies but i would never rent this one again it just did not make any sense a family that lives in the woods invites their son his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and daughter in law do not get along well we never figure out why until almost till the end of the movie but until then all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of <UNK> and the daughter in law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims to this thing that we have no clue as to what it looks like all we see is a bright light <UNK> his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of darth <UNK> voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies then when we finally find out what and who it is all i did was laugh this killer turns out to be some kind of alien japanese warrior from ww2 who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family and all the mother does is stand there in front of the living room shaking with her hands on fire or something like she's going into some kind of this movie is pathetic avoid it it's not even worth renting
<START> wesley snipes is perfectly cast as blade a half human half vampire known the he has all their strengths and his only weakness is the <UNK> for blood since he teamed up with <UNK> kris kristofferson he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us <UNK> for centuries but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> frost stephen <UNK> is tired of living in harmony with the humans food as he calls them and he plans to the blood god and take control of the world br br this movie is well cast written and directed <UNK> the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue blade is certainly more action than horror but it definitely delivers br br 8 10
<START> the movie seemed a little slow at first but it picked up speed and got right to the point it showed exactly how the government and the scientist <UNK> for humanity and the reasons of the gadget i enjoyed it it is very close to reality as any movie about the atomic bombs that were to be dropped on japan i have recommended it to friends i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> should be <UNK> for attempting to do something different with this surprisingly heartfelt film a <UNK> tale about the <UNK> of being honest about everything melinda hamilton stars as amy a girl who has had <UNK> sex with a <UNK> in the past on a <UNK> she struggles with telling her fiancé john of course the truth does rear it's shaggy ugly head the film deals with the <UNK> of said <UNK> the movie is well acted by all save for perhaps jack as <UNK> who never really felt like he <UNK> well with the picture and the film while solid enough seems to miss it's mark a few times every single person in the film struggles with massive <UNK> and all our a tad hard to relate to <UNK> should be <UNK> for doing something different as i said before but different does not always equal good and this <UNK> ever so slightly not to own directorial debut the criminally misunderstood shakes the clown br br my grade c
<START> if a movie has an unimaginative hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really really funny you can get away with a lot if you're funny but while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in <UNK> boy they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance br br the movie certainly doesn't aim to surprise anyone when alex hides marijuana in his <UNK> house in a tea tin you know what's going to happen later on and it does the movie appears to have been written by a <UNK> who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them br br the most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting the game takes place in a video game development company which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy but don't be fooled this is not a movie about video game <UNK> this is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games br br the way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of j p j p is i think more or less <UNK> by the creator of doom john <UNK> at least inspired to the extent that he's an odd genius who makes games br br in the movie j p is a weird obnoxious geek who is <UNK> and <UNK> by the company game that makes no sense at all if you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games as j p is supposed to be then even if you're quirky and obnoxious people will still admire and respect you on some level if stephen <UNK> is obnoxious his associates still aren't going to make <UNK> of him to his face br br also game are just as likely to be <UNK> as j p but in the movie they are basically frat boys it's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious <UNK> movie and while that formula has worked very occasionally in the past it is absurd in the setting of a game company if you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie you don't simply <UNK> in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one unless you're a hack br br about two thirds of the way through the movie i gave up something happened that i knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events and i realized i hadn't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway so i stopped although i did fast forward just to make sure i was right that they would follow the most predictable clichés which they did br br normally if a movie's bad i just say it's bad and then run out of things to say but this movie is such a <UNK> shoddy production that it deserves a long <UNK> br br shame on the movie for <UNK> a good actress like linda into it then surrounding her with talentless <UNK> i'll give the movie 1 point for giving shirley jones the chance to be the anti shirley <UNK> though
<START> <UNK> wing is a pleasant surprise of a movie keeps the viewer interested i didn't know anything about it being made by the british until i read the other viewer comments i can understand why it won an award for cinematography for it was brilliantly presented must have looked magnificent on a vast theatre screen br br it seemed to be a lot more realistic than most westerns in portraying how the west was more truly won as well as the <UNK> of the characters it presents the indian sam <UNK> character is particularly intriguing he seems to be brutal in the savage environment he is <UNK> to but displays remarkable respect for the <UNK> he witnesses in the white men women he encounters he is not friendly or sensitive to these <UNK> in his lands but he has a limit to his sense of vengeance even a compassion when he is in a position of power <UNK> the <UNK> white man bent on revenge as well as the girl he kidnaps after capturing a <UNK> as such his character seems complex but to the harsh lands he lived in which were threatened by these <UNK> he is not heartless in his <UNK> with br br the magnificent horse he rides is a critical link it is interesting to note how this indian handles it compared with the martin sheen character who has it in his possession power for a time <UNK> wing is an unusual western a genre i am not drawn to but i really appreciated this excellent offering which i would rate second only to a man called horse
<START> the bone collector is set in new york city starts as one of the world's foremost crime scene experts lincoln rhyme denzel washington is involved in an accident which leaves him a <UNK> jump forward four years alan gary <UNK> his wife lindsay <UNK> olivia are kidnapped soon after new york cop <UNK> angelina jolie is called to a crime scene finds the buried <UNK> body of alan <UNK> notices some unusual crime scene evidence makes a note of it which <UNK> rhyme when he is asked to work on the case he quickly realises the evidence are in fact <UNK> clues to the <UNK> of lindsay having <UNK> the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill leave <UNK> clues for rhyme the police br br directed by phillip i watched the bone collector last night i have to say it's one of the worst big budget post the silence of the <UNK> 1991 <UNK> 1995 serial killer thrillers i have seen in fact it makes friday the 13th 1980 look sophisticated realistic the script by jeremy was based on the book by <UNK> is so poor on so many levels i hardly know where to begin for a start it takes itself deadly seriously that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad the character's are truly awful i didn't believe any of them were actual human beings first we have lincoln rhyme who is <UNK> from the neck down there's just not a lot the script can do with him in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film he is seemingly impressed with <UNK> because she stopped a train thought a fresh <UNK> near a murdered person might be of relevance i'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a <UNK> near a murder victim might be of some relevance why is he so impressed with her then there's <UNK> who is not only unlikable shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh skin <UNK> removed from their bodies how exactly did this guy get to be a police captain then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible are you trying to tell me they <UNK> an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves the intended target rhyme anything else also after <UNK> an intricate plan to kill these people get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife being able to walk use their arms they are actually defeated nearly killed by a who has no movement in his body below his neck how did that happen i should also mention <UNK> who is a terrible character she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene <UNK> shoots rats for no apparent reason br br besides some of the worst written character's ever the story plot isn't much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking <UNK> of flesh from his victims it's never explained why a rookie cop like <UNK> is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper <UNK> teams there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they i mean a bloody animal bone <UNK> rat hair <UNK> how does someone go from a bone rat hair to the exact <UNK> location of the next victim has the whole of new york to choose from there's some nonsense about a bird that sits on <UNK> window <UNK> which is just totally random at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going there is so much wrong with the bone collector it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever it's atrocious on all levels has zero credibility apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting br br with a supposed budget of about 48 000 000 the bone collector is well made with good production values that hollywood <UNK> about it i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen i think she is absolutely terrible in this denzel washington just sort of lies there really queen <UNK> is awful even michael <UNK> can't do much as he is stuck with a clichéd one dimensional character br br the bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while i saw it for free on telly last night i still feel cheated ripped off there are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing works either way to be honest
<START> you think the police are always right br br you believe that eye witnesses are always right br br you believe the <UNK> will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98 of a basic investigation br br you believe a u s city might have a few bad <UNK> in law <UNK> but that the good cops will quickly <UNK> those who <UNK> engage in evil for sake in the bud br br you believe that the possibility of an ex football being as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff and being allowed to beat <UNK> out of randomly selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the america of the 1930s but not today br br you believe a judge will not send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the <UNK> is a totally random <UNK> by <UNK> by the police because it was hot and they did not feel like working that day br br you believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are exceptions to the rule and an injustice like this could never involve your family member someone in the middle class or someone like you br br you think that you are aware of every terrible <UNK> 100 proved outrage of the last 10 years in america yet you haven't seen this film
<START> like many other people i've heard about more and i wanted to watch it due to the music that was composed by pink <UNK> i must say that i was truly disappointed not because of the music but the movie in itself it's a boring insipid movie that lacks rhythm where does this disappointment come from according to me from different things first of all the movie's subject the drug <UNK> up badly with the <UNK> sunny atmosphere of the movie this one should have taken place in the <UNK> areas of paris and should have gave birth to a dark and helpless climate for example moreover it's supposed to tell a descent into hell but this descent is <UNK> and barely <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> doesn't insist enough on the dramatic side of the story you could have wished a little more of madness cutting on another hand <UNK> doesn't succeed in gaining the audience's emotion and <UNK> in front of the two main characters' distress you watch <UNK> their trials with drug whereas the two main actors they're perfectly <UNK> and hardly <UNK> during the movie especially farmer at the end you only retain the beauty of the landscapes <UNK> in <UNK> the film created a huge sensation when it was released in 1969 nowadays it br br seems dated the <UNK> culture is nothing less than a <UNK> memory
<START> what <UNK> some of the <UNK> <UNK> films and many others in western and adventure films of the early thirties was their lack of what we recognize as formulaic story telling to be sure they had good vs evil the basic element of any western boy meets girl and some stock characters such as the old <UNK> and his beautiful daughter or grand daughter and sometimes the evil <UNK> or other businessman but the way the action played out was often different from film to film br br 'the <UNK> features earl in his big star turn not as for some inexplicable reason <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> half american posing as a mexican who speaks the language <UNK> ' his biggest posing as a mexican seemed to be his outrageous <UNK> clothes the only plot seems to be that he wants to steal ruby the <UNK> of old dusty <UNK> hayes when meeting her for the first time gives her a long once over look that puts him in the big <UNK> with sexual <UNK> you'd think that because the opening scene shows killing john wayne father off camera it would play a bigger part in the film it doesn't too much chasing back and forth between heroes and villains br br we get many good stunts though from <UNK> <UNK> including pulling ruby up on his horse when he rides by jumping on and knocking them off their horses a horse leap off a cliff into a lake and even the same slide down the sequence that was in the lucky <UNK> 1934 although this time the mighty <UNK> uses a body surfing <UNK> instead of <UNK> a tree <UNK> and its inclusion is just as illogical this time too since they are in a desert br br the high point is clearly john wayne's <UNK> and <UNK> well photographed walk across the desert after the fleeing and stumbling with those fantastic <UNK> of red rock canyon seen in countless serials westerns and science fiction movies framed behind him no final gun duel at fifty <UNK> with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the <UNK> hero in this movie when john wayne finally catches up with him drinks <UNK> water from a and dies br br after a couple too many chase sequences gang is finally captured in cabin <UNK> one by one from behind a <UNK> that apparently leads to a canyon now <UNK> off by having been no riding off into the sunset or kissing the girl the final shot is ruby now mrs john <UNK> on the <UNK> to the now sheriff john <UNK> what would sheriff <UNK> like for dinner the film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning the pacing is slow some parts with the sheriff cause it to drag and the horse chases fill up the film so despite the different and unusual elements it comes off as one of the weaker lone stars
<START> i must say i was disappointed with this film although it is well acted and directed the underlying story simply <UNK> along too slowly br br granted in another mood i would have liked it better i did chuckle a lot but rarely laughed out loud and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won but in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day one neither of us had heard of before this one <UNK> in comparison br br if you see lots of movies then by all means see this it's distinctly better than your average fare but if you like me have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining save this for later br br rate 7 10
<START> this took me back to my childhood in the 1950 's so corny but just <UNK> no one ever could play flash gordon like larry buster <UNK> just great i have two more series to view flash <UNK> trip to mars and flash gordon <UNK> the universe cannot wait br br
<START> by <UNK> what an <UNK> mess revenge incestuous love mechanical games like fighting <UNK> and utterly unnecessary violence some primitive music <UNK> away at the <UNK> victims big surprises which actually tend to be about as <UNK> as the national <UNK> add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds this movie's totally <UNK> popularity <UNK> <UNK> the very low level pop sub culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades but also in <UNK> as <UNK> taste on an <UNK> audience for by far deeper insights into human <UNK> under mental sickness without <UNK> s vulgar <UNK> i recommend an older dutch french movie the <UNK> br br well don't believe there's absolutely nothing good to say about this movie in fact there is the in famous scene in which the hero is really a hero an <UNK> father who sleeps with his daughter and then attempts to obtain rather than redemption eats a live <UNK> benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in the entire cast the <UNK> itself too bad the poor beast having been eaten couldn't survive its one and only act in order to obtain yet another worthless <UNK> for the best actor at the cannes festival br br which festival by the way between moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless if somewhat exotic weirdness became a festival of the vapid and of the ludicrous br br <UNK> <UNK> gloria <UNK>
<START> this has to be one of the most awfully scripted films i've ever seen it's basically a remake of the beast from 20 000 <UNK> 1953 but done with your standard snake like puppet monster instead of a <UNK> ray <UNK> creation combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of the <UNK> terror and you have an idea of what this movie is like br br the movie is dubbed although by the original actors i think that the movie was originally dubbed in italian for that countries audiences then <UNK> for us release which just makes the movie seem weird the sounds like in a japanese monster movie just don't quite match properly to the action on the screen even if the actors' lips are moving properly br br poor ray <UNK> he's certainly come a long way down from the lost weekend or <UNK> m for murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in add this to his other sci fi panic in the year zero x the man with x ray eyes and you can see a once good actor fallen into a boris karloff syndrome stuck doing really bad horror films in foreign countries just for the work
<START> i tried lord help me how i tried but there are just some people almost incapable of creating quality brett <UNK> uwe boll britney spears and asylum to their credit the 9 11 <UNK> report seems like an honest attempt by the company to advance into a more sophisticated state of storytelling and movie making but for all <UNK> and purposes it comes off as another truly film in their gallery at the opening the <UNK> <UNK> audiences that all the names have been changed but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same a man named attempts to learn how to fly a plane with a stone cold <UNK> that would instantly make anyone uneasy this undercover agent is able to learn how to fly on a small computer and you have to wonder not how he was able to get into this program so easily but on how these people didn't even ask questions because this scene is so far fetched in its presentation and the actor playing this man is extremely over the top and you can see that director scott attempts to <UNK> paul <UNK> with a bright grainy photography that's followed by an awfully <UNK> and irritating hand held direction that throughout the entire film attempts to take off from <UNK> <UNK> ho <UNK> film making techniques br br you can sense scott <UNK> <UNK> technique for realism but it becomes rather lame <UNK> halfway in meanwhile the film comes off less a traffic take off and more a take off on law order in which we'll have the <UNK> <UNK> us the names have been changed the <UNK> almost reminiscent of the law order <UNK> and then ninety minutes of the actors <UNK> their <UNK> and discussing politics br br neither of which are ever as compelling as it tries to be and then when the film seems as if its attempting to be an adult drama scott relies on his old the sex scene scott's new film looks like it really wants to be thought of as a low budget <UNK> but it's not and it manages to be <UNK> on every such occasion possible the 9 11 <UNK> report falls flat and that's because its limited in its attempts to imitate other films br br while i appreciate the ambition inherent behind the camera this new perspective of the events leading up to 9 11 is flat and dull hard as it may try to be a low budget <UNK> it's only really as entertaining as a normal dolph lundgren film you'd find on <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted disgusting ways i thought i'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is <UNK> and then has his head set on fire <UNK> is quite the <UNK> too she takes a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> her mouth shut then hangs her upside down in the <UNK> just in time for a roaring fire <UNK> made me sick it made my eyes hurt i was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever ever ever made by otherwise competent people until the finale i have to admit i loved the ending it involves a boy and his toy tape <UNK> <UNK> by linda blair looking fantastically possessed the scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie's over but you know that old saying if you've got a great ending people will forgive you for just about anything
<START> in order to pull off a job like this caper in <UNK> e g the score and its <UNK> one has to have nerves of steel this one apparently demands and <UNK> it jules <UNK> is the master br br i was on the edge of my seat throughout it deserves to be better known even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954 due one <UNK> to the director being <UNK> in the <UNK> hollywood of its day br br i would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it br br i cannot give it enough stars
<START> for those not in the know the <UNK> books are a hugely successful series of comic books about a village of <UNK> who resist <UNK> invasion thanks to a magic <UNK> that <UNK> them <UNK> <UNK> there have been several animated features only one of them the twelve tasks of <UNK> really capturing the wit and spirit of the books despite being an original screen story before a perfectly cast christian <UNK> and gerard depardieu took the lead roles in two live action adaptations that proved <UNK> successful throughout europe but made no impression whatsoever in the english speaking world br br the uncut french version is great fun but sadly does not appear to be available in a version with english subtitles outside of the uk dvd while there's still no sign of a us theatrical or dvd release the <UNK> version of <UNK> et mission is also on that dvd and has played on uk tv and you'll never guess what it's been completely re edited at least 21 minutes gone and dubbed into english maybe <UNK> it for a hong kong movie after all he never saw a foreign film he didn't think couldn't be improved by heavy re editing and <UNK> for a few years br br whereas <UNK> et <UNK> <UNK> was lovingly dubbed into english from a particularly good translation script by terry jones but otherwise left <UNK> that sort of thing really isn't the <UNK> way the results ain't good the film was the best attempt to get the books mixture of slapstick <UNK> and <UNK> classical humorous <UNK> to the screen but a lot of the classical references are gone such as the great raft of the <UNK> sight gag or the <UNK> de <UNK> references from depardieu alongside anything that seems too french or might slow the picture down with the result that the first 20 minutes are now a real <UNK> several <UNK> to sequences are missing <UNK> part has been <UNK> his part was already fairly small because of his serious health problems during the shoot the us version has been partially <UNK> to change the <UNK> of his face in the original and as usual with dubbing because literal <UNK> into english don't fit properly lines are either rushed so much they're not funny anymore or the dialogue has been changed completely a couple of these changes are admittedly funny like one character dreaming of a world in which he could move his lips in french and hear the words in english br br not a total disaster but very disappointing considering how good the full length version is it would be nice to think that <UNK> would do a shaolin soccer and release both versions but since they've <UNK> both films for two years since paying for them another classic case of <UNK> notorious <UNK> <UNK> gee wonder why disney were so p d at their and still have no release plans that may just be too much <UNK> thinking br br it's a real pity that such an accessible and entertaining film will now only be available to non french <UNK> in such a clumsily <UNK> version it seems the <UNK> may have been able to defeat <UNK> <UNK> but are no match for the <UNK>
<START> don't be fooled by the other reviewers although this film contains an impressive array of talent the material they present leaves a great deal to be desired <UNK> king <UNK> 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts though he does impress with his piano playing is not a bit funny though i remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth actually the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap dance and a four tops <UNK> and the jazz band itself especially in the number featuring the bass player the print itself is pretty poor quality and the wonderful <UNK> mcqueen is totally wasted in the <UNK> plot
<START> step by step is my opinion is a pure abc hit i can't recall every episode but i still enjoyed it it's hard to say which episode was my favorite however i think it was always funny when a <UNK> occurred at school i always laugh at that as a matter of fact i think just about every single one of j t brandon call and <UNK> <UNK> mitchell lines were funny it would have been nice if penny had stayed on the show throughout its entire run everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion i hope it never stops airing in <UNK>
<START> normally bbc productions of jane austen are pretty good but <UNK> <UNK> is just odd what were they thinking this film has little of <UNK> charm and ironically <UNK> the gothic novels that austen so wonderfully <UNK> not only that the gothic sequences are tacky over the top and frankly silly the actress playing miss <UNK> is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the <UNK> of an <UNK> bachelor and though i rather liked the creepy peter <UNK> as mr he is not a bit like the novel even when delivering dialog straight out of the book robert hardy as general turned in one of his few terribly ham performances this film was so bizarre and strange that i actually watched it again just to <UNK> how <UNK> wrong it was
<START> without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the <UNK> to see my whole life take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a <UNK> br br then add a cheap camcorder you know the old vhs types that cost <UNK> on ebay add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film what a shocker it was they couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it she was fat and ugly and was the worst of all i actually watched it all as i could not believe this crap ever got <UNK> br br miss at all costs
<START> and you know why because they thought or at least made horror fans think that a bunch of obnoxious foul mouthed screaming teenagers some stupid demons where do they come from what is their purpose who knows and a dark mansion are all you need to make a horror movie needless to say they were wrong you also need a script some logic some rules and some invention this flick does have one scene that lives up to its reputation the <UNK> scene of course and a couple of funny moments the kid brother's description of his mother's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> don't look at me scene it also has more profanity than any movie i've watched since i last saw <UNK> dogs literally every fourth or fifth word is a f or a b then again when a movie begins with four false scares in its first 5 minutes you know not to expect anything resembling good filmmaking 1 2
<START> a mediocre at best horror flick that deals with dumb not so horny teens who discover an evil video game gasp is killing those who die in the game double gasp this movie is the <UNK> mystery of the mystery gang in scooby doo i was waiting for them to pull off a mask of one of the villains i could deal with this for 40 minutes even as a movie on sci fi but going all the way to the theaters come on people the effects were very mediocre this whole scenario is something of crummy two but director uwe boll since this would be his cast as always the great thing about video game systems is the glorious power button i'd suggest using that mid viewing 1 2
<START> once you sit down to see this film a cannon for you get the feeling it's going to be a great the reason the film begins with a rousing score by noted composer elmer <UNK> who gave us such memorable themes as 'the great escape and the magnificent seven ' indeed when you read the opening credits <UNK> the cast is none other than george <UNK> as capt rod douglas you know it's going to have action and <UNK> of it furthermore when you see actor john <UNK> playing general john j you know you're in for a heroic saga the story is taken from the <UNK> of the mexican revolution and involves the u s in a border town <UNK> with the mexican <UNK> who cross the <UNK> <UNK> in the early <UNK> among the most <UNK> of the rebel leaders is general <UNK> <UNK> with his army of mexican <UNK> he attacks kills his men and steals some valuable <UNK> pieces since the united states army cannot enter mexico <UNK> capt douglas is sent on what is <UNK> a suicide mission without orders and without aid from his mission is to retrieve the <UNK> destroy a rebel <UNK> and bring <UNK> back alive <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> most experienced certainly the most <UNK> men available douglas enters mexico and attacks the nearly <UNK> <UNK> dramatic action follows as does lots of explosive excitement if one is asks for criticism i would say the choice of <UNK> and john are not very menacing not so with the men who side with <UNK> pete duel and don gordon who is superb nevertheless this movie is recommended as good viewing
<START> this film follows the life of a great guitar player who wants to make it big but acts <UNK> almost to the point of self destruction br br i was expecting the usual woody allen witty dialogs sarcasm and humour but sweet and <UNK> failed to provide any the main character ray is an <UNK> rude irresponsible and <UNK> man he is so unlikeable that i do not want to now about him or care about him i wonder why a film about him has to be made the pacing of the story is slow making the film a terrible bore even sean <UNK> great acting fails to revive the film to a watchable level br br i like woody allen's films a lot but sweet and <UNK> is a major disappointment
<START> let's face it this is a pretty bad film however if you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience okay you'll scream in agony a lot african jungle fun in a dopey kind of way br br tom <UNK> who spends most of the film wearing a funky <UNK> is using the local witch doctor and mad science to create a perfect being it looks like a <UNK> that has been on a six week drunk and is in a sack dress ugly is being kind but it won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as his subject he needs a bad bad girl br br <UNK> english and lance fuller are two petty crooks in search of african gold acting lessons for ms english should have been at the top of the search list she's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play mike touch <UNK> is the white guide english fuller con into leading the expedition br br english <UNK> finally meet and it is a match made in hell she is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything stress anything to get what she wants you will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point br br what made this movie interesting for me was <UNK> wearing that funky <UNK> hat <UNK> <UNK> piece still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him br br truly bad cinema
<START> does anyone else think that <UNK> is basically a ripoff of <UNK> just look at the characters from the two families <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the blonde <UNK> elder daughter <UNK> connor and <UNK> hart who's married to a moron mark <UNK> and van <UNK> the sarcastic brunette younger daughter <UNK> connor and <UNK> hart the little brother dj connor and jake hart and the quirky relative jackie connor and barbara jean booker hart br br and then of course there is the biggest similarity <UNK> hart and <UNK> connor <UNK> tried to copy the sarcastic and tough love style mom without giving her the same lovable qualities as <UNK> had or perhaps they made her too lovable for <UNK> hart seems to <UNK> between being mean and scary hence <UNK> line to his wife <UNK> i'm not afraid of you i'm afraid of your mother and being sweet and caring with little transition in between <UNK> at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind since she was always mean and sarcastic and whenever she tried to open up it was hard for her as inconsistent as character is it's hard for her to be believable br br but even if the characters weren't completely ripped off of <UNK> nothing could've saved the show from being sub par in the plot area the writers try to give the show substance but they really can't lay off the corny jokes long enough to give any impact and you'd better believe the jokes are corny it's as if they were written by a twelve year old who thinks that any joke is hilarious while occasionally they come out with something that's funny i don't pretend that i didn't laugh at a few episodes these gems are too few and far between to make <UNK> witty br br overall <UNK> is a very mediocre show with obvious <UNK> of <UNK> sub par plots and sub sub par humor and let's face it terrible acting the show might be a bit better actually if they replaced all the actors especially <UNK> herself who is more community theater quality than prime time sitcom quality br br i give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in
<START> back in the cold and creepy early 90's a show called family matters aired and became an instant classic the trick was to buy a <UNK> in standard family situations and their <UNK> and insert some attempts to sarcastic remarks in it and you had yourself a lovely little stealing is wrong parents are right show so that worked out fine so warren had a new ambitious plan making the exact same show again br br here's the difference though family matters had step by step has the guy from those <UNK> sequels nobody saw he says things like and the <UNK> <UNK> and somehow the audience is still not supposed to hate him i mean seriously how can you even get that across your lips br br the rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole <UNK> bunch combined with some more one or zero dimensional characters like the dumb guy <UNK> well eddie the smart girl laura and a pretty girl who spends her days looking pretty in theory the character development was just awful in this show <UNK> and the cookie monster have more depth than the <UNK> family everybody just <UNK> their stereotypes for what they were worth they weren't worth much br br powered by a massive laugh and cheer tape stolen from something funny this show aired for a <UNK> 7 years which was <UNK> for the competition although you'll have to note that this is the time where family sitcoms were pretty much all big hits everybody just ignored their because well it was the 90s one more crappy show didn't hurt
<START> one of <UNK> best this movie is filled with sex and nudity it has gorgeous sexy women and some sexy settings br br believe me there are many <UNK> and steamy sex scenes but not as hot as the women we have outside settings a hot <UNK> <UNK> of course and some other nice places to have sex br br <UNK> parent is great in the opening sex sequence where she behaves like a naughty girl is amazing she's extremely sexy and performs in at least 4 hot sex scenes my favorite is when she has sex during a <UNK> or something like that she has this short dress removed and the rest you can go figure it out <UNK> rea also has a sexy sex scene where again she demonstrates that beautiful cute faces can also perform great in soft core sex movies br br the most memorable scene in my opinion comes near the ending it's a double sex feature that has to do with <UNK> sex intense sex and <UNK> mccarthy receiving it real hard so loud that the couple in the <UNK> feel interrupted the scene is long steamy very explicit and fun my favorite from 2001 br br the other good scenes include getting it on the woods really kinky then dressed as a bride br br <UNK> rea always super gorgeous dressed like a <UNK> girl has a steamy sex scene nice br br please watch this movie if you enjoy b soft core sex it's among the best from the new millennium i had a blast with it
<START> great music but ain't these people pathetic a true period piece of the <UNK> sixties and it left me depressed the director paints the wrong side of the life and it <UNK> as a nest if the culture of the time led people to do these things it appears to me that it was all a journey of no discovery only despair i tried really tried to like this film but these people aren't anywhere on my page yes it would be nice to see the world go away for awhile but i always plan to come back drugs aren't the cause of these characters' <UNK> it's their lousy attitudes  these guys <UNK> drink their cup of poison they <UNK> their lives and in the end <UNK> the journey that is life has romance ever been so dark br br cheers interesting scenery wonderful soundtrack by pink <UNK> br br <UNK> dated drugs depressing thoroughly unlikable characters they aren't flower children br br only for the curious since most <UNK> <UNK> the pink <UNK> connection rare <UNK> tracks many will have never heard before as <UNK> ain't what it was br br rating two stars
<START> this movie is one of the most memorable films i have seen i went reluctantly with a turkish friend who recommended it i am not a very enthusiastic <UNK> of music documentaries but when a <UNK> woman banned for years from singing in turkey sings her piece the theater was in awe i would give my all to hear a cd recording of this haunting gorgeous song and she is just one of many artist interviewed and recorded speaking of their experiences of performing in <UNK> even now a month later i remember the footage of singing in an <UNK> <UNK> and i try to remember the music as it <UNK> in the cinema well done to faith akin the director of this film and his great idea to capture the many splendid sounds of such a <UNK> city it would certainly encourage me to visit <UNK>
<START> louis <UNK> jr returns to the well one more time as <UNK> <UNK> who goes to doug masters played by jason who is in for jason who wisely <UNK> to teach a new band of <UNK> however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste this is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry this one however doesn't have any of the <UNK> or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable iron eagle iv is directed with such indifference that the <UNK> come off as if we were watching a <UNK> 2 game played by two <UNK> teenagers it is horrendous to watch and <UNK> jr who has made his share of <UNK> seems to have <UNK> out here and i saw cover up <UNK> iron eagle iii toy soldiers and jaws 3d what is mysterious about louis <UNK> jr is that he seems to be like christopher walken in his quest to do anything as long as he's working as i look at his post oscar win some of his better movies include iron eagle the <UNK> and the principal considering that the latter two movies have him co starring with dolph lundgren and james belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work of course enemy mine and remain his best post oscar win work br br out of 4 bad
<START> house of dracula works from the same basic premise as house of frankenstein from the year before namely that <UNK> three most famous monsters dracula <UNK> monster and the wolf man are appearing in the movie together naturally the film is rather messy therefore but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring it's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes the plot sees count dracula arrive at dr <UNK> home asking for a cure for his <UNK> then what can only be described as a coincidence sees lawrence <UNK> a k a the wolf man turn up asking for a cure for his <UNK> it turns out that dracula is on the <UNK> for <UNK> daughter but <UNK> really is serious when it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf the wolf man throws himself into the sea where he ends up finding <UNK> monster br br overall this film isn't as good as the earlier house of frankenstein the 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each universal monster <UNK> plot is the biggest at first but soon <UNK> out only to <UNK> at the end the wolf man is the star of the show but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in <UNK> monster is given the <UNK> hand as he appears in the movie merely as an <UNK> and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie the story of the doctor who <UNK> all three together is the most interesting but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film the acting is good enough with john carradine showing his sinister side and <UNK> <UNK> jr once again making sure that his character is <UNK> in tragedy glenn strange is given nothing to do and <UNK> stevens proves the real highlight as dr <UNK> overall this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of universal horror but as silly monster movies go house of dracula is worth seeing
<START> this movie was in a box set with 20 others with varying quality i can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the heap br br it is pointless to go through the plot what there was of it picking out what was wrong as i haven't got all day life is to short which reminds me i have just lost around 85 minutes of mine watching this tripe br br the acting was <UNK> bad in a way that made it funny though only just whilst the comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any laurel hardy fans <UNK> one of the only barely funny moments was when the leading lady made a joke about her former friends plastic t <UNK> which would have been okay if i hadn't had to watch them bob around whenever she on the screen br br the lowest i can give is one it probably deserves that for having heather thomas in it as she was certainly sexy <UNK> though her acting was as bad as everyone else
<START> we chose to see this movie as an alternative to the polar express showing at our local <UNK> theater what a waste of time and money first it is not cute the snowman at times looked demonic other times he was simply a zombie he showed no expression or emotions most of the time and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy br br secondly santa states in the beginning it's a movie about the spirit of giving santa and a snowman <UNK> war on each other is a movie about giving i'm all for a little parody but this just wasn't funny or entertaining br br the idea that the <UNK> <UNK> is his voice is different too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his <UNK> not even a thank you to santa br br the only funny parts of the movie were the <UNK> at the end of the film too bad they didn't use them in the movie it would have been better
<START> what is it with studios like paramount that have a <UNK> hit film series on their hands and figure it can screw around with the budget and formula paramount spent less on this film than they did on which doesn't sound bad until you realize that there's a 10 gap between when the films were made the 40 cost to make would be equivalent to about 75 million in 1989 this film is the reason that shatner has never been given a fair chance to direct other films as well every time he turned around the studio was <UNK> the budget and making demands regarding the storyline the fact that this was the one storyline that <UNK> and shatner could agree upon for the most part made the <UNK> directorial task tough enough but after all the <UNK> were done all anyone ended up with was an uneven story and a load of badly executed special effects not worthy of the original series much less a major motion picture the most glaring examples all of the effects were severely out and fake looking the shot of the enterprise going into the great <UNK> was so obviously a still frame shot being <UNK> away from at least the <UNK> stick that held the enterprise cut out up was successfully <UNK> out god chasing kirk up the mountain they may as well have just cut in shots of godzilla climbing the <UNK> at the end of godzilla 1985 and used <UNK> to scratch the <UNK> off of the film to make electric <UNK> come out of his eyes at the captain kirk yes friends i have a real problem with the look of that last scene especially br br thank goodness star trek <UNK> was such a <UNK> of a film
<START> the brave one is about a new york radio show host named <UNK> <UNK> jodie foster her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves she has her great fiancé david andrews whom she is planning to marry but one night while <UNK> and david are out walking their dog they are attacked and <UNK> by a group of <UNK> leaving david dead <UNK> <UNK> but is <UNK> and traumatized later on and can barely cope with real life anymore she buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection but one day she's shopping in a store and a man comes in and shoots the clerk dead it is then that <UNK> shoots and kills this man and she becomes a vigilante killing anyone who tries to <UNK> or harm her or any others at the same time detective <UNK> <UNK> howard is tracking down this <UNK> unknown killer and in the process becomes friends with <UNK> <UNK> begins to regain her sanity as she kills these violent people but is unsure of whether or not what she's doing is morally right and as her and <UNK> become closer he doesn't even realize the unknown murderous <UNK> is right next to him br br jodie foster gives a very good performance in the brave one she portrays this type of violent morally <UNK> character brilliantly <UNK> howard is also great in this movie both have excellent chemistry together and <UNK> the film to a certain level the brave one looks visually <UNK> and conveys some brilliant camera work but not all of it works to a great effect the scenes where <UNK> is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out her front door to face the world the camera <UNK> back and forth to the sides in an almost dream like way and really captured the moment with essence whereas almost every time <UNK> killed somebody everything just had to go <UNK> mo and show her facial expressions in fine detail the <UNK> mo was properly used when <UNK> committed her first murder but why keep doing this effect almost every time she committed murder the camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the film but there a few scenes here that are just plain <UNK> br br the brave one is very much about how these murders affect <UNK> emotionally her fiancé is killed by a group of thugs and suddenly her love of new york city is turned upside down she realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city and she says so on her radio show i don't completely understand this though <UNK> acts as if she never realized that violence can occur at night in the city and that's pretty stupid if she lived there all her life she must be either blind or very oblivious <UNK> also seems to be a <UNK> for <UNK> murderous people she really doesn't even have to go look for them they just to come to her as if they're begging to be shot dead for their wrong doing the brave one deals with the morals and proper use of violence strongly at first and then suddenly it <UNK> it the ending is very negative and completely <UNK> and <UNK> it also <UNK> the purpose of <UNK> <UNK> character which the movie spends so much time trying to <UNK> develop and suddenly his morals take a u turn the morals in the brave one become very <UNK> and just plain <UNK> all over the place by the end so violence is okay it's a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for vengeance i pretty much refuse to believe that you know why because i have a conscience which this film surely lacks it is not right to take the life of another person no matter how bad they are or how much you hate them <UNK> <UNK> sets out to stop these evil <UNK> but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills br br jodie foster and <UNK> howard provide a lot of strength for this movie the brave one contains a strong message but that message is both <UNK> and wrong this movie may look pretty well acted and intelligently strong but it becomes pretty rotten by the end i give the brave one a 1 5 out of 4 the message is very out of line and morally incorrect and really can't be saved by the good acting
<START> i have never been a great fan of oliver stone often because i have found his films to be forced preachy and generally flawed the two stone films i truly like are <UNK> and talk radio yet talk radio takes the cake for being <UNK> finest achievement stone is a director <UNK> you are either a fan or you are not it is safe to say that before watching talk radio i was not fond of the guy and considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry though after watching talk radio some of my <UNK> have changed talk radio is an unsettling and amusing attack on what is now known as reality tv br br talk radio follows a self indulgent dysfunctional determined hysterical outrageous and <UNK> radio host named barry who <UNK> a controversial late night radio show in dallas quickly becoming well known for his bold and quirky air presence he becomes a late night sensation <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and morons call in to be <UNK> on air the film shows the rise and fall of the man's career carefully making an accurate portrayal on freedom of speech originally adapted from a stage play the film <UNK> itself to the theatre theme that it was originally built around wonderfully conveying the film's fierce nature br br with the <UNK> energy and non stereotypical air talk radio brings all the hilarity behind crass media it remains even more poignant today than it was in the late '80s the film goes into depth studying the likes of arrogance self obsession offensive behaviour controversy <UNK> and ignorance the film shows through a controlled manner how it is good to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech yet it is something that should be used wisely rather than <UNK> blunt stone tries to show how freedom of speech is a crucial importance in life but is something that we should be <UNK> and <UNK> about the film asks the question of is our main protagonist just the same as the sad people who call up the show br br stone <UNK> creates the film's key set piece the radio station with an ambition and cold atmosphere he then succeeds in capturing the isolation fear ambiguity and the dangerous emotions that are built up at the radio station eric <UNK> is perfectly cast as the isolated self absorbed and complex genius barry he fits the role perfectly letting off his lines with such enthusiasm urgency <UNK> <UNK> and ultimately the bold hilarity of his offensive nature the performance <UNK> with spark which was evidently robbed of an oscar nomination his voice suits the character being that a primary element of a radio host and his power of acting along with tragedy and comedy works brilliantly br br there is a strong use of editing in <UNK> films and talk radio boasts some of his <UNK> most <UNK> editing he uses beautifully controlled camera techniques which <UNK> from being calm to suddenly becoming <UNK> there is a vibrant energy behind the film with its raw and wonderfully delightful script working as a centre piece for the greatness of the film the striking and <UNK> cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio most <UNK> capturing the city at night not forgetting the <UNK> heartbreaking and yet darkly funny climatic spiral to decline is ultimately remarkable cinema br br talk radio is an essential modern masterpiece i am certain you will be surprised by just how great it really is i highly recommend talk radio for anyone interested in media or film talk radio is a fine example of top notch intellectual and insightful entertainment which still packs a well earned <UNK> call finally if it was not for eric <UNK> the film would not be the fun delightful and enduring masterpiece it is today
<START> we enjoy a film like fame because we imagine we are there ourselves music dance and drama students enjoying our self expression this film had humour entertainment and must be an inspiration to young people to have a go at the performing arts bravo fame certainly worth 8 out of 10 br br chris
<START> although bullet in the brain is without question superior amongst short films it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film and it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot but after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place there is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit it seems like there's almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast a slightly more relaxed pace and a less <UNK> faced narrator in the final section would have <UNK> this film a little bit despite these complaints there is no denying that bullet in the brain is a quite <UNK> work compared to many short and even full length films the makers should be <UNK> for trying to make such a basically emotional and <UNK> film in the current climate of quick jokes and hollywood action
<START> alas it seems that the golden times of stylish italian cinema have sunk into oblivion and the recent <UNK> of celebrated filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> is yet another obvious proof to that <UNK> br br i felt lucky to watch many films from this prolific director like body puzzle <UNK> macabre and both demons albeit not entirely satisfying they have never been that dull br br a suspicion that this new entry to my dvd collection was money thrown to the winds <UNK> shortly in the aftermath of the car crash scene <UNK> an awkward and unlikely position of the body under the flip over car br br and the sense of <UNK> grew up in the course of the <UNK> narrated chain of events that followed br br dumb dialogs <UNK> script and a total waste of talents from the international cast the only character that provided more or less passable performance was the mischievous <UNK> son up the entire boredom br br unfortunately <UNK> son job on all accounts could hardly be <UNK> br br i look forward to seeing his murder house hopefully expected to be an improvement
<START> this movie despite its list of b c and d list <UNK> is a complete waste of 90 minutes the plot with its few peaks was very predictable it was so silly that i cannot believe that i am taking the time to even write a review of it <UNK> to his credit has grown in his ability to act since playing michael jackson in a made for tv movie a few years ago on the other hand has as she was more talented in her role as some years ago as i sat watching this train wreck of a film with its pitiful production and horrible sound quality other four letter words came to my mind to qualify what i thought of this film however in an effort to keep my <UNK> g rated i'll simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an l lame
<START> quit while your ahead is a phrase they never learn typical hollywood sequel scenario if the first film was only shocking the second wasn't expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year even worse are the <UNK> events of which were already explained in detail if you haven't seen to first two films you will not like this one it's like starting to watch lord of the rings or star wars with the last trilogy movie so stand alone this film is not br br remember in the first movie about revenge remember the second about the long lost savage brother well if you saw those two 5 min moments and <UNK> them together you would a 5 min prequel but the creators <UNK> thought these 5 min were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to some actors cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process i have a <UNK> of money i make movies for a living and i'm bored what will i do i know i'll make a movie so anyway you get this 5 min prequel and you stretch it for 90 min  that's this movie and you know what will happen to the main immortal characters so there is little suspense by the way all the drama of the movie is in those 5 min the only thing that made my <UNK> rise was mom killing in the begging of the movie sick the rest was braveheart <UNK> if you want a comedy see braveheart first then this movie br br now i'm going to rant a bit  the movie put me in the mood who invented the concept of vampire vs werewolf in the first place it's older than i am and got old just as fast and why do vampires look like <UNK> girls in heat while werewolves look like psycho bears hiding bad films behind <UNK> fails isn't it about time we got some sane <UNK> werewolves with an <UNK> <UNK> how can their <UNK> werewolves even breed if they rip everybody into <UNK> and why with all their powers the vampires didn't rule the world what a waste
<START> is a game of words life and <UNK> but i personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title it <UNK> a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable <UNK> furthermore the way everything is connected at the end is in my opinion a bit pathetic what remains of it was a set of images an interesting one but not enough to make this a good movie br br i believe this film is supposed to be a comedy but i surely didn't noticed the nonsense and nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable i have to say i fought hard to continue seeing it until the end and i am still not sure it was worth it
<START> this movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on tv for free and that it probably helped the romanian economy other than that hallmark needs to re <UNK> this division of their empire and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer stricken in <UNK> to go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable it wasn't i remember the act of watching it there being vampires some of them teenage and some very bad dubbing whoever worked on the dubbing track of this movie needs to be <UNK> to another <UNK> of society maybe food service to the deaf if you have the opportunity watch this movie just because it makes so many other really bad movies seem oscar worthy in retrospect then again if you actually ended up at this movie's profile i imagine that it may be too late
<START> i don't understand why it is so underrated on imdb this movie is just the perfection the better adaptation of all times of the myth of tarzan as a french i can say that this is the better role of <UNK> <UNK> ridiculous in a lots of movies but here absolutely wonderful charismatic incredible the plot is great well told the story magnificent the direction the atmosphere the music every things are perfect how believe these sequences with the music just simply perfect br br <UNK> is truly an unbelievable movie underrated here i don't really know why but really appreciated
<START> as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clichéd movies that hollywood makes there seems to be no creativity in hollywood companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in br br this movie is a welcome change it could be classified as romantic comedy for it's genre but don't let that turn you off this movie this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces br br if you are reading this you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are <UNK> 60 and art of travel which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage br br this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same br br dean
<START> artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by mel from his play the man concerns a <UNK> house <UNK> taking in a troubled <UNK> who may be homicidal despite solid work from <UNK> <UNK> and robert ryan both trying their best this tedious yarn isn't very inventive within its one primary set which quickly becomes visually dull and <UNK> cast of characters there is however a smart <UNK> who senses the worst hokey and <UNK> with a stilted direction from harry <UNK> perhaps <UNK> should have directed where's all the suspense promised by the ads also served as a co producer 1 2 from
<START> i was completely <UNK> by the comments on this film mainly by someone saying they saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it expecting this to be a nice run of the mill american pie style film i was deeply disappointed br br firstly the camera work is awful i don't think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay still and having the actors move close up and far away of their own <UNK> br br secondly the scenery my god i've seen more <UNK> in a <UNK> nest the club was totally unconvincing with around 3 extras dancing in the back ground at any one time the <UNK> were bare and lacked personality br br <UNK> the actors wow the director obviously went for the typical <UNK> character set up a <UNK> main character with a gruff i don't give a f k character that takes pot shots at the main everything the main character said and did was a chore so much so it made me <UNK> br br overall the plot the supposedly big revenge theme lasted for about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation the characters acted <UNK> and didn't seem to have any real relationship with anyone else no character had any depth to them they may as well have been cardboard cut outs walking past the static camera br br a truly horrible piece worse than a first year students 2 minute short for youtube advice to the director change your name and deny any association with the film that will probably sell one copy at a yard sale in <UNK>
<START> one true thing may have seemed like a horror movie to the <UNK> of the 80's but it doesn't ring true today unless you happen to be part of a <UNK> upper middle class family which is so <UNK> from the world that it has never <UNK> suffering br br avoid this shallow flop
<START> all grown up had a lot to live up to and there was much hype when this show was now it's easy to explain why it didn't live up to expectations firstly this show failed to create a realistic world of pre teens in the way that <UNK> captured the world and the imagination of <UNK> secondly the show's character's are <UNK> types <UNK> white <UNK> blond as opposed to <UNK> colored girl from modest family or boring tommy <UNK> and annoying <UNK> finally there is not one ounce of <UNK> or an original plot line to sum up all grown up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a sequel series to a show such as <UNK> it's boring lacks imagination and it seems that the producers don't even know how 10 to 13 year olds behave to be accurate shouldn't <UNK> and <UNK> be comparing <UNK> <UNK> rather than fight over who's better at doing <UNK>
<START> a movie visually <UNK> but interesting is mainly the plot the film depicts a <UNK> progress of exploring the main actor's <UNK> feeling max who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his ex girlfriend whom he still <UNK> very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are <UNK> quite well the three women max has met <UNK> something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations his <UNK> is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see she gives him also no love but only <UNK> true love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex girlfriend merely a fantasy for him to escape many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems <UNK> the one who really <UNK> <UNK> life in fact is her best friend the <UNK> achieved at the end is not identical to the initial <UNK> because max has understand much more about his <UNK> feeling the <UNK> structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated not equally ingenious as pulp fiction but things seem much more natural in the apartment max is not the only character who <UNK> a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to the good cinematography also makes her and monica <UNK> look very beautiful a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing br br
<START> i watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left <UNK> disappointed with the third <UNK> it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic australian <UNK> into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie the character of max is <UNK> from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting <UNK> that left me feeling betrayed if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half spoiler alert the other major issue i had with this film that truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man we had already seen him in the road warrior where he had helped max and yet when he <UNK> in <UNK> it looks like the two had never met whether he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors <UNK> man i do not know however it was not explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film 2 out of 10 doesn't get a 1 10 because of the <UNK> fight
<START> i just finished watching this film for me the most outstanding work in this film was the music score while many silent film scores work very well with their scenes i feel that this is the best score i've come across the <UNK> scenes in particular worked extremely well
<START> let me get this out of the way before i trash this film i love park chan work as a director while i disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time i can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively i really liked one of his other films sympathy for mr vengeance also min acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously for 1 5 of the runtime that is br br now the bad the plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema literature i'll never understand how critics can trash a hollywood blockbuster for being cliché then <UNK> movies like <UNK> which are just as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more so regardless <UNK> is flat out one of the most generic unoriginal movies ever conceived spoilers man is held captive man seeks revenge man finds out he had sex with a family member man's life is over end spoilers simply put this plot line has been used in everything from greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies books in between it is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens i laughed out loud does that mean i'm a <UNK> freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me no what it means overdone plots make people laugh the scary movie franchise proved that and <UNK> proved it as well why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just <UNK> out tried clichés masked with fancy camera work and classical music that brings up the issue of blood gore simply put it isn't there the director is too <UNK> to even point the camera at the screen when something gory happens as if we're watching a children's movie or something maybe we were anyway i've heard <UNK> called the most brutal movie of all time and the most disturbing movie ever but when i watched it i failed to see anything even remotely gory or disturbing all the gore is off screen and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in pg 13 movies like the dark knight or casino <UNK> before why this even got an r rating <UNK> me much less the most brutal movie of all time seriously i've seen movies that just make <UNK> look cute on every level when it comes to violence gore br br the other huge glaring cheesy flaw is the main villain the majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic american pie style but i'm supposed to think he's oh so evil when he's wearing clothes his hair is <UNK> back like a bad asian mix of the <UNK> james bond villain mixed with something out of austin powers he talks like a brain dead teenager recovering from an acid <UNK> and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again seriously <UNK> had me laughing more than any comedy this year br br in the end <UNK> is for those of you who <UNK> fine wine have no sense of humor and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties it's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the films never movies they enjoy are br br to those people all i can say is this i like films and also like movies i like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition and i also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma but the thing is for me to like both films and movies they have to be original they have to be something i haven't seen so many times i lost count of the number of times the plot has been used when something isn't original it's <UNK> if it does exactly what everyone else does it's forgettable and boring before you give <UNK> yet another perfect rating because it touched you maybe you should think about something wouldn't a movie equally as touching but at the same time original make you think more i just wish someone other than me would understand this br br overall <UNK> is forgettable and cheesy br br 1 10
<START> i've read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark i've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical buddy film de niro is in no way murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie in fact part of the comedy of this film is de <UNK> <UNK> to be friends with anybody br br murphy really shines in this one he is back at doing what he does best acting like a complete ham he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show de niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid i thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice <UNK> russo is also great as the tv producer of course she loves everything murphy does and tries so hard along with to get deniro going too br br a lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with william shatner <UNK> his role as <UNK> hooker to train de niro how to act like cops but my favorite scene involves murphy in the <UNK> hoping he could get a snipes like cop to team up with instead of de niro man that was hilarious comedies often depend on your personal tastes sure you could poke holes in the plot most often you can with a comedy i was <UNK> to see the pairing of murphy and de niro i think it brought out the best in murphy which was nice to see him at the top of his game again i can only imagine it was a great honor for murphy to be paired with the great de niro rating 8 of 10 stars
<START> surface is one of the best shows that i have ever seen nbc is so stupid for <UNK> a great show like this and worse of all only leaving it half complete nbc or someone else should give surface at least one more season just so it can be completed it's as if nbc gave you a book to read and half way through it they decide to take it away from you and then you can never find out the ending i just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly see what happens to i think i can say this safely about most surface fans is that we want to save has taken all of our hearts away and then nbc just cuts them in two come on nbc just give surface one more season
<START> this movie was good i can't say it was one of the best but it still was good the only reason that i watched it was because of ryan <UNK> he is <UNK> hot don't get mad reese but i think that it was sort of funny not a laugh your head out kinda thing but still o k
<START> i don't usually watch hollywood <UNK> but i was dragged along with some friends to see this one which turned out to be amusing in places but totally devoid of any originality don't worry you won't have to think tarantino like storyline leaves enough over obvious hints for us to correctly predict where this one's going about fifteen minutes before every twist i sat there worrying that the film was building up fairly nicely for a hollywood flick but that it would have nowhere to go at the climax and boy were my fears realised <UNK> couldn't save this one but <UNK> tyler almost did i suppose being male and in my <UNK> helped but she delivered a really good performance obviously she didn't have to do much except look absolutely stunningly over the top sexy but what she did she did well is certainly not going to go down as one of hollywood's great <UNK> or should i say shouldn't because the mainstream american film industry is not going anywhere at present and hasn't for a decade at least save the odd hit like american beauty titanic and saving private ryan and even those had major flaws but if you're a teen male do yourself a favour and see <UNK> she is one hot chick rating 5 10 see also anything by quentin tarantino any american teen film over the last decade anything with sex as its main selling point
<START> to say the truth i went to see this movie only because nicolas cage is my favorite actor folks may not agree but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies i haven't seen a movie with penelope before so i was anxious to see whether she is a good actress so here's what i think br br the movie is good i haven't read the novel however some moments were really thrilling and unexpected altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple so the only thing that could save the movie which an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning would either end <UNK> or happily was the performance of both cage and and it was great great great in the latter part of the movie i even liked a rather broad accent of the actress spanish but for those who don't speak greek that's ok and she even looks like a greek girl overall the movie is highly enjoyable and has a good deal of irony fans of classical music will surely have fun at some moments br br i give it 9 10 you should see it
<START> michael has accomplished quite a feat especially considering it is only his second start as writer producer and director generally first <UNK> lack vision and direction when <UNK> a major production but <UNK> proves mr is going places in hollywood set with beautiful scenery <UNK> boasts experienced cast members especially <UNK> james who communicate vast vision with exceptional clarity few films can mix the slasher horror genre with a genuine action adventure feel but <UNK> accomplished this completely this film certainly qualifies as one of the top notch films in both of these categories if you are looking for fast paced action with more than a <UNK> of suspense look no further i look forward to future projects with great enthusiasm well done
<START> the cell fascinated me at first glance i was a bit surprised about that fact because the story of that movie is absolutely boring if it had no story the film would be better <UNK> un <UNK> <UNK> comes to my mind a film without story but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images but the cell is at first a hollywood movie and only second a piece of art i'm very interested in next project hamlet on indian could be very interesting especially when it has the same looks as the cell br br for film music <UNK> howard <UNK> score for the cell is absolutely marvelous but a hard listening experience because of its very <UNK> style
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen so bad it is astonishing i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film ok it wasn't his fault that someone gave him those lines but he could have refused the role and tried to learn how to act instead how did anyone get the money to put this film together is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain oh yeah they will love this one it's got no believable plot some <UNK> movements chuck norris a black sidekick with bad corny lines a sweet little israeli or is he an arab or does anyone care boy <UNK> and the devil brilliant and many thanks to all concerned for <UNK> the human race
<START> this is movie is really bad i like to flip on the tv while <UNK> and this movie looked like it would be something good to sleep through and boy was i wrong my body literally woke me up from sleeping and said hey this movie is awful you gotta watch it i love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots something about unintentional comedy gets me going this movie is <UNK> crappy i really don't know how to properly express it aside from <UNK> you watch it just to see how bad it is i mean seriously you should watch it with people i was making the best jokes <UNK> during this movie and no one was there to hear them br br worse than <UNK> it's that bad
<START> am glad that i am not the only one to find this series very good this is the best series for young ladies i have so strange taste on comedies and i find so hard one to please my intelligence and i am so happy that their humor is exactly what i need love the gang of actors if anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one i say pretty please write back because i miss the series br br and kindly ask the writers and the producers to continue it even if the actors are now all grown up i guess br br have a nice morning day evening night because i do not know the exact time you will be reading this post
<START> my mom and i rented this movie i mean we love those type of sci fi flicks whether they be big hollywood flicks or <UNK> flicks br br but oh we were fooled two <UNK> are investigating a <UNK> <UNK> in a small city in texas halfway through all the sudden things get all on us my mom and i believe in god and jesus and the devil but the way this movie was preaching it made it annoying all i really have to say is that we are christian but even we like to have fun so don't blame christians as a whole just blame the christians who need to suck the fun out of this movie br br in fact you can clearly understand the directors stance on <UNK> and that is that he believes it is all demonic now i could say some words but i will not all i will say is that do not watch this movie unless you feel like being <UNK> in fact many times it states that we must be perfect in order to enter heaven well last time i checked the only perfect person died on a cross
<START> the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter's complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details br br <UNK> portrays karen was not a fine election she is a good actress but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter i think that the role needed a stronger character someone with a stronger personality br br louise <UNK> role as <UNK> carpenter is terrific she does a great job as <UNK> mother br br it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they weren't though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries
<START> looks like the bet movie i've ever seen not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive antonioni is <UNK> wise to his movie so <UNK> roles are so true situations are so real i've change my world <UNK> after this cinema i'm a <UNK> <UNK> in russia country of <UNK> and and i'm quite sure watching antonioni is good and fun for <UNK> because i and we do understand his point of view so i don't understand his lesser on imdb i'm sure speaking from russia and our people we like antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality
<START> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> deliver wonderful performances here as jonathan silverman as eugene <UNK> his life in <UNK> <UNK> beach br br what makes the film so good is the relationships among the characters with a backdrop of extremely wonderful family values br br bob <UNK> had a marvelous opportunity here as the father of the clan he gives a restrained but compelling performance as the <UNK> of the family br br his sons played by jonathan silverman and brian dillinger are fabulous there are certain scenes when silverman is <UNK> or <UNK> where i'm reminded of jerry lewis br br as for <UNK> and they too are wonderful their mannerisms <UNK> and <UNK> of the jewish culture are beautifully realized by them br br the cinematography is just wonderful beautiful <UNK> in <UNK> even as the <UNK> of war <UNK> the film is rich with many of the typical problems faced by families in that period in a sense you don't have to be jewish to experience what the family is going through br br a must see for nostalgic buffs and those of us who believe so strongly in family values
<START> while the movie has its flaws it brings to light some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no democracy it makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives their struggles and a potential leader san it makes one wonder why our government will <UNK> places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help
<START> okay so when a friend of mine told me he was supposed to direct and i thought heck i got to check out monster man and see what its like maybe i can get a part in it but when i popped it into my dvd player and and tried to choke down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad bad i mean horribly annoying bad comedy from that fat ass thinking he's funny not to mention how the director spent on the pointless desert road trip i <UNK> to the conclusion that these guys didn't have a clue of what they were doing and missed the boat by a long shot the story had potential to be somewhat different than the usual <UNK> you see on the blockbuster hollywood video shelf put out by lions gate these days but they surely messed this one up why put so much time and effort in shooting annoying bad acting and bad jokes why not <UNK> the road trip and put more of the plot in the movie the writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of the horror and gore that they had to find filler to make the usual <UNK> minutes all in all and i'm being easy here maybe because a friend of mine is the bald redneck in the bar scene that gets his skull crushed when chasing the three leads out into the street i will give it at least 1 star for trying and the gore kill scenes weren't that bad again they tried too bad lions gate could have created a cool franchise from this idea but failed i don't recommend paying to rent it maybe you can find a cut down version where the movie starts from the <UNK> <UNK> scene crap
<START> the thing that's truly terrifying about this is that the filmmakers thought they were making something intelligent and sexy instead they made probably the stupidest horror picture of the year br br this movie starts with a bunch of art <UNK> friends at a gallery this trashy european weirdo walks up and starts talking pretentious to the main character sounding like he just walked out of an episode of dark shadows he then offers her up some stick to smoke yes a <UNK> stick which she eagerly agrees he picks off some red crap and puts it in a <UNK> for her to if this ever happens to you in real life don't do it br br she's transported to some weird wannabe jean <UNK> <UNK> that's supposed to be sexy but isn't where there's this thing that looks like a <UNK> creature from the black <UNK> br br soon she turns all her artsy <UNK> friends onto her new form of supernatural crack no matter how much these idiots freak out and turn blue they can't leave it the hell alone at one point she even makes out with the rotten creature br br after the final battle and the stupid woman is <UNK> or whatever the so called hero is left alone to pack up his copy of michael moore's dude where's my country and can't resist smoking that stick one more time to try to rescue his moron lady friend what a <UNK> br br rates four stars for sheer unintentional humor
<START> <UNK> <UNK> home video br br plot a pretty high school student is marked for <UNK> terror in this suspense filled made for tv movie <UNK> <UNK> is new in town she makes friends has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way that is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while <UNK> after more and more phone calls she is raped throughout most of the movie she tries to find proof that the person did rape her br br audio video this 1987 vhs edition from <UNK> stinks there are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen br br extras no extras from <UNK> home video br br final thoughts this suspense filled made for tv movie was made in 1978 so don't expect many deaths there are none if you can find this movie with the home video <UNK> on the front then buy it but the <UNK> version is pretty crappy this can be a little boring but if you are patient the ending is pretty good
<START> <UNK> ii does no justice for the thin plot thin actors exception of randy quaid the only thing that is decent with this movie is the soundtrack maybe this movie should have been destroyed when the script was written
<START> <UNK> le <UNK> can either really creep you out or totally <UNK> you off your feet either way you can't help feeling a little awe on <UNK> this classic wb character this personally believes that <UNK> was the inspiration behind other would be animated <UNK> today from cartoon <UNK> johnny bravo to disney's <UNK> from beauty and the beast br br his unique brand of love making is to be wondered at in today's world where his antics would normally be slapped with a sexual <UNK> warrant and at least a distance from all his victims br br in this particular cartoon a world weary cat decides to do an ultimate <UNK> and earn some respect for a change for pretending to be a <UNK> all goes well until <UNK> arrives and promptly <UNK> the unfortunate <UNK> with his <UNK> enthusiastic love making br br the <UNK> for <UNK> many <UNK> are laid in this cartoon from his adorable love calls to that <UNK> calm hop chase of his br br this cartoon only goes to show that as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned the most <UNK> can go the distance and have his beloved pig <UNK> leaving dust <UNK> behind them
<START> john carpenter's the thing is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made sadly as with most carpenter movies go it is also one of the most underrated movies being <UNK> by critics shortly after it's release for a reason that is almost pathetic it seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of the good alien an idea <UNK> after the success of i t and the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could <UNK> from that idea was regarded as <UNK> human ignorance is truly a frightening thing people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be br br the thing itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of a u s <UNK> base discover the presence of an alien being <UNK> throughout the movie only as a thing able to imitate any form of life not knowing who might or might not be the creature we see how every character <UNK> to the situation there is no mass <UNK> or panic just a slow and <UNK> descent in to chaos as more and more people turn up to be not quite human br br carpenter succeeds into <UNK> this movie into something far more than your average sci fi horror there are no whats behind you jumping moments here instead relying on an intense atmosphere of <UNK> and pre apocalyptic despair along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror with no small thanks to rob impressive creature effects he gives us an experience not matched by many other horror films br br instead of just throwing facts and plot elements at our face carpenter offers us a much a more <UNK> and delicate approach by <UNK> a sense of mystery he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret ate what has <UNK> in certain scenes while giving enough plot to those who are not so fond of interpretation in movies br br <UNK> <UNK> score works all the way it's <UNK> and depressing sound perfectly fits the movie's overall tone although i've always wondered how would it have sounded if carpenter he has been known to <UNK> all of his except this one did it characters while not as deeply developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors especially kurt <UNK> who plays the down out <UNK> helicopter pilot r j <UNK> its worth noting how his character transforms through the movie from his don't give a attitude in the beginning to that of a and leader of the group of men who try to fight the thing but even with that said there are no false <UNK> here there are no laughing at the face of death moments and there certainly isn't any sort of comic relief the movie keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last speaking of which here once again carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful ending br br quarter of a century after its release the thing doesn't feel dated and with the <UNK> growing use of computer generated effects it feels even stronger then before because it shows the life's work and dedication of human beings not computers combined with its <UNK> for <UNK> it gives the viewer a lot more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or time a masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten
<START> <UNK> sets up a scene early on in chop shop that immediately had me <UNK> with where the character of <UNK> <UNK> and his friend were coming from the two of them get on a subway and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyone's attention for a moment and that they are selling candy bars or m <UNK> or something and then they proceed to sell some bars if you as i have ever been on a subway in new york city at any time this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost don't notice it often the people on a subway will see kids like these or <UNK> selling something or <UNK> and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind focus isn't necessarily just on kids who <UNK> things for sale on subway rides but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in america it is subsequently in his hands thoughtful and heartbreaking usually at once br br to compare it to <UNK> or the <UNK> thief isn't too far of a leap actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other though is specific in his intentions in his documentary style we care about this character ali no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him but it's not simply because we're force fed any clichés aside from you know a brother and sister more so the brother trying to take care of one another makes the story accessible through the simple <UNK> ali has the kind of goal that is possible <UNK> in his situation saving up enough to buy a used food truck that ali and can operate themselves br br it's all ali is working for but what shows us in brutal detail is this work what ali has to do to make it happen even if its <UNK> things like ripping off of <UNK> from cars in <UNK> stadium or at one point stealing a purse in a desperate moment this makes it all the more serious an issue when <UNK> sees what his sister does for money on the side at night doing sexual <UNK> for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road he doesn't mention it and pushes it aside but its always something that adds to the tension something <UNK> wants to protect his sister from it adds to the tragedy when <UNK> finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profit maker a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just <UNK> br br one could look immediately at the fact that <UNK> is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of queens the film was shot in naturally as with a work of neo neo realism lets just call it realism featuring practically all non professional actors in the parts of the <UNK> and workers and people on the streets but is focused more so on the here and the now and that is what makes chop shop so immediate and heartfelt not a trace of melodrama is in the film barely even music <UNK> aside from the live latino music coming from the cars and <UNK> sometimes will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it <UNK> in further scenes like the way <UNK> is awake but acts like he's asleep the first night after he witnesses late night <UNK> and we see as she into bed she probably knows he's awake but neither can say a word or in a lot of other scenes poetic touches that seem <UNK> like when the man shows <UNK> how feeding the <UNK> work br br it's rough and gritty as you can expect and it doesn't give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness <UNK> about it's also a superbly shot hand held film where the technique as with a lot of movies made in its urban set tone and approach informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what they're doing but it also is never <UNK> shot or too flashy the filmmaker has a superb <UNK> <UNK> cast <UNK> was <UNK> from a nyc public school without any experience and knows how to not waste a shot while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows it's not city of god or <UNK> it's its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to or a first one barely on our way in a city such as new york if you're not moved by <UNK> and his daily struggles i don't know what to do for you
<START> so <UNK> <UNK> is in it so automatically we compare this film to aside <UNK> the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is these films are totally different br br the actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a team br br if you want a film where things happen then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their damaged by their experiences and how their lives are <UNK> br br this film have genuine interaction perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath no its not exciting but it is gripping if you can <UNK> with these characters at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief br br there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in move you allow yourself to forget these stars and not to judge them as actors but let them become people you will truly <UNK> yourself moved br br go on give it a go
<START> as you may remember i have seem all three of the trilogy of trash and the first movie is the only one even remotely close to be watchable part two was low grade <UNK> and this installment is slightly better then two but still one steaming pile of something i removed from my backyard last monday the premise doesn't make sense why did the <UNK> murder that poor old lady and even in <UNK> i think someone would notice a bunch of <UNK> guys where a sweet little old lady once lived second that scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they looked in the first movie it's just old clothes and a <UNK> sack let's face it the series is garbage and should be forgotten about the <UNK>
<START> with so many good movies coming out in 1995 particularly mortal <UNK> and seven unfortunately there had to be some bombs as well and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring predictable plot and a lousy ending it seems that antonio <UNK> hasn't been able to find a decent script since <UNK> the only remarkable film he's done anyone with an <UNK> of a brain could tell who stalker was from the beginning her flashbacks of the death of her mother did nothing but <UNK> an already paper thin story pity that dennis miller was wasted in this film this part resembles his <UNK> similar role in the net br br the convoluted ending had me shaking my head as i pretty much did throughout the entire movie plus any film that depicts animal cruelty in any shape or form no matter how fake it looks automatically gets the thumbs down from me br br to make a long story short if you want to enjoy a good thriller then avoid this at all costs never talk to strangers especially those who recommend this movie 2 10
<START> i am proud of mike has said he should be because this film which either has been <UNK> by many of us or studied and <UNK> by film <UNK> works on many levels br br yes it's unconventional to many frustrating it's almost as if the producers hand you the film and <UNK> you figure it out br br you probably already know that the <UNK> tv show was a runaway marketing success that <UNK> upon business <UNK> and no small serving of public deception tv shows are about selling soap and <UNK> first than to entertain that the <UNK> broke out of the box for a short time to make head is a testament to the <UNK> popularity and importance in pop culture despite where your <UNK> at get one thing straight head is not the <UNK> tv show br br so what we have here is a psychedelic documentary about western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject head is a movie that could only come from those inside the box by 1968 the cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment the movie was a deliberate attempt at market so it did three things make a film the way the <UNK> <UNK> most importantly <UNK> the group to one not <UNK> to it's old bosses and <UNK> <UNK> than before make a film that exposed american attitudes of information <UNK> br br head therefore really is about media manipulation and its net result deception the mass media is supposed to inform <UNK> us on the happenings in the world at large and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action thus we assume the information we <UNK> to be complete and <UNK> otherwise how can one establish a <UNK> conclusion on any one idea presented by a book newspaper or tv show in one of the street interviews in head a guy admits i haven't looked at a newspaper or tv in years is he lesser or better the man even the drug parallels are a soft of things are not as they seem remember the old joke everything you know is wrong the screenplay starts with the public admission of it's own <UNK> image and runs with the football literally is the football scene in the movie a visual <UNK> of the whole idea behind head is the film a stream of consciousness exercise is the film the <UNK> of pot smoking <UNK> there are too many <UNK> that occur in the film that suggest otherwise my guess is that head is the <UNK> of motivations somewhere between intended and <UNK> br br largely the <UNK> responsible for head seem to enjoy themselves in the that take place in the film but there is anger anger at the chaos that <UNK> the late '60s and anger at the way the media television especially had changed culture in negative ways drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late '60s and still are but the producers of head want you to know that poor information is a far greater danger br br wars have been attributed to and lies what perfect way to spread <UNK> than through tv repeatedly the mysterious black box is seen as an <UNK> to the <UNK> and seemingly all of us as well in one scene peter is <UNK> sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream <UNK> and is asked by a fellow monkey what's wrong i bought this ice cream <UNK> and i don't want it the movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform but to sell en mass <UNK> head goes further put any idea into someone's head and <UNK> goes he br br the filmmakers know this and the danger is real head is either a movie that creates itself as we go along or is a deliberate statement perhaps perhaps not maybe it is just pot meets advertising as critics <UNK> in 1968 the jokes are on the <UNK> and us be careful what you ask for you may get it br br cheers a true guilty pleasure very funny intelligent will please the fans find the substance it's there <UNK> weird bizarre collection of characters good length is appropriate lots of great one liners including my all time <UNK> favorite the tragedy of your times my young friends is that you may get exactly what you want br br <UNK> dated drugs no plot no linear delivery of any thought in particular at least twenty five stories that <UNK> in stop and go fashion so may easily <UNK> may seem pretentious to some people who can't stand the <UNK> need not watch though that in itself is no reason to avoid it the psychedelic special effects may kill your <UNK> picture tube or your acid burnt out <UNK> br br match cut
<START> i have for years remembered a song just a couple in a castle no twenty <UNK> square just a couple in castle in the air i couldn't find the song but i remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs i located a reference to the movie on the web i had seen the movie when i was only 9 year old at the <UNK> theatre i was pleased to find that it had kenny <UNK> the singer with guy i am a <UNK> fan and then to see that it was produced by the <UNK> bros who did another very good full cartoon feature of travels also remembered <UNK> also the songs were associated with <UNK> and frank <UNK> who are among the very best no wonder i remembered the film the song and the colorful animation as a full musical this is a movie which should be remembered as a one of the best of the early full musicals now that i remember it the plot may not have been earth shaking but was very well presented and makes for a easy to watch delightful movie
<START> george burns returns as the almighty after enjoying a big success with <UNK> oh god an upbeat fantasy made successful by a sudden need in the 1970s to switch from devil driven thrillers to comedic redemption although it made money the original was more in line with the <UNK> comedies of the <UNK> than a return to feel good religious cinema here god appears to a young girl who had earlier starred in a stage production of annie and asks her to spread his divine word causing her nothing but trouble from grown ups in the process peculiar family oriented film appears to be warm hearted enough and burns gets to <UNK> in with a nice <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> but the writing is half slapstick and half seriousness with the adults of the piece considering putting little away all of which makes god seem more like a <UNK> than an elderly friend is another problem a <UNK> kid with <UNK> little eyes she is <UNK> for screen acting and occasionally seems awkward the medium budget production has a tv movie appearance with few <UNK> touches the final scene <UNK> the climax of the first oh god in that it brings a <UNK> sentiment to the mix which is welcomed it's the most subtle moment in the movie from
<START> fate puts a pair of priceless items in <UNK> hands and he gets kidnapped and taken to africa because of it this was my first ernest film so i can't compare it to his others but i thought it was fairly amusing good stuff if you like slapstick humor and plain old <UNK> around
<START> a competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of jack lemmon and walter matthau i suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed the two grumpy old men films as there seemed to be a bunch of these buddy team ups <UNK> the comical duo in their twilight years the idea is a sure fire one matthau a bumbling <UNK> who's thousands of dollars in debt his unsuspecting friend lemmon into taking a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies the catch is they've been signed on as dance <UNK> and matthau can't dance br br out to sea is a funny film and not all of the chuckles are to be found courtesy of lemmon and matthau i found brent <UNK> best known as data from star trek the next generation to be very humorous as the <UNK> ball <UNK> dance <UNK> as the <UNK> boss of the two aging actors he manages to match them in the laughs department though the film doesn't really need any there's also a a love story or two to be found here as well involving <UNK> cannon who looks pretty fine for her years
<START> going into this movie i knew two things about it i knew that it was a real extreme flick and i knew that it was somewhat artsy both appeal to me in their own right but when placed together it can be something truly unique and this was damn right without a doubt unique like i said above it is an artsy film the way they used some intense sound it reminded me a lot of an <UNK> film visually i haven't seen anything like it the cinematography and lighting were done very well the movie seriously uses visuals and sounds better than anything i've seen in a while especially when you consider the experience these young filmmakers had couple 20 year olds you really have to take your hat off to them br br the movie isn't easy to describe or even discuss there isn't an actual <UNK> you could say it revolves around the right and left side of the brain and how they control your think it's four segments or four ideas brought alive through visual and <UNK> extremes there is some talking hear and there but it's mostly a non speaking film br br the first segment is the <UNK> and it revolves a naked body and an <UNK> try and guess what wrong the second segment is my favorite it involves a brother and a sister who looks a little like sarah silverman but with bigger boobs the brother is crazy and the sister is somewhat of a whore i would say this is the most extreme of all the segments and the most well made the gore effects in this one were great the third segment revolves around a bunch of naked people it up with mother earth it's probably considered the weakest of the bunch but still is smart and well made the fourth segment is probably the strongest of the film and i'd also say the deepest for myself i'll have to view this a couple times to understand what's truly being said i know that it <UNK> christianity in a way that would most likely make your mother <UNK> or throw give it a try br br <UNK> cruelty was recommended to me and i'm proud to say this is now in my movie collection it's extreme violent gory very sexual and surprisingly pretty damn thought provoking the next line i'm about to say has been used in almost every review i've read for this film this movie is not for everyone now ain't that the truth if you're into extreme films and or you're just a lover of film that wants to see something check this out 8 1 2 outta 10
<START> i quote below words from my favor writer <UNK> as the comment for this movie br br when you really want something all the universe in helping you to achieve it br br it is too easy to forget who we really are and what we desire to do in life because there are always too many comments and advice surrounding us to tell safety i had almost forgot what the passion feel like despite of the adventure will take me out of safety zone i <UNK> believe the fear is just the price that i need to pay for the coming brand new journey in life br br thanks for inspiring me with this lovely story it is the <UNK> for me to realize what <UNK> love is that is the most love from the light of soul
<START> i managed to see this at what i think was the second screening in the world a few days after its opening at the <UNK> international film festival while i was attending another film two nights later at the same theater i saw brendan <UNK> paul and the rest of the cast crew at another <UNK> screening of <UNK> br br i have to say that i was <UNK> disappointed with the film i was by no means expecting a masterpiece but what was presented to me i believe lacked all the crucial elements of the genre it had set itself into before i continue two things i accept that some filmmakers like to <UNK> generic expectations here this is simply not the case secondly i know that it was based on a play which i haven't read but have been informed that it isn't a <UNK> piece of literature but this does not excuse the massive narrative problems that <UNK> the film br br my main problem with the film is the script forget that it was based on a play as a sports comedy it simply doesn't work the down and out team are trying to win a football cup few of the games are shown when they are it is very short and we are not given any satisfaction due to any of their sporting achievements having read so far you might assume that it is not a strict sports film but a psychological study of the relation between a <UNK> of a manager and his hopeless team it certainly does not achieve this i'm not even sure if it was aiming to any attempt to shed light on the history of any of the characters is hackneyed and <UNK> overall i found the script lacking in many respects br br i do think the performances and the music were good and technically the film was well made but aside from those points which should be expected from any irish film at this stage i left the theater feeling very disappointed br br my judgment may seem harsh but i do think there is some hope for a strong national irish cinema in the near future and this simply does not back that argument as <UNK> has become a recommended <UNK> film i was part of the audience at that screening most people would seem to be <UNK> with me so that means you should probably make your own judgment of the film
<START> i decided to watch this movie in order to fall asleep it kept me awake so it was interesting however it was pretty bland br br the acting was good i don't think any of the actors did a bad job mickey rourke is as believable as an over the hill hit man can be the dialogue in this movie does not provide much opportunity for these actors to show off their full potential but they still <UNK> br br the atmosphere was great music was good and colors matched the mood that the director wanted to paint for the viewers even the weather enhanced the mood of the movie everything was well done br br the failures of this movie are in its story development the storyline with the mafia vs <UNK> doesn't get enough attention the storyline for carmen and wayne's divorce doesn't get explained the fbi seems to work extra fast here is there no <UNK> for all these <UNK> is it really that easy to dig up your brother's body from his grave burn the corpse and have it be identified as you there are too many <UNK> in the storyline for me to give this movie anything higher than a 4 out of 10 rating i wouldn't recommend this movie to people unless they're really bored and have <UNK> some really good <UNK> even if wow is down for <UNK> go find something better to do than watch this movie
<START> aunt <UNK> had always been <UNK> and her well <UNK> family ignored the remark she made after her brother <UNK> funeral he was murdered wasn't he they remembered it the next day when <UNK> was found brutally murdered with a <UNK> br br for some reason the <UNK> movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book i was disappointed about the changes made in cards on the table my favourite <UNK> book after the funeral is my 2nd favourite <UNK> book and i was scared the story would be destroyed it wasn't the movie was nearly page for page faithful throughout right down to the killer's motive all the actors were wonderful but my favourite has got to be monica <UNK> who gives a great performance as miss <UNK> the companion to the late aunt <UNK> without a doubt the best <UNK> movie ever
<START> scarlet coat like most revolution flicks <UNK> well received but is <UNK> perfection in the art of movie making a great character study of john andre the heroic <UNK> who is <UNK> by both friend and <UNK> for courage scarlett coat also <UNK> the <UNK> of the undercover agent as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> befriends andre and <UNK> a high level <UNK> of british intelligence yet he <UNK> andre in <UNK> the film captures the moral ambiguity of the spy br br how much of the <UNK> world is real which reality does he belong to the reality of his or the reality which the cover story creates br br <UNK> capture and is a success for <UNK> in his mission beyond that <UNK> would have ever <UNK> the mission was merely to identify the <UNK> in us ranks <UNK> has knocked out enemy intelligence as well yet <UNK> <UNK> the death of the man he was sent to destroy br br ann francis plays a stock american character <UNK> with the british but willing to engage them in a war of wits br br a movie well worth <UNK>
<START> my wife and i watched this abortion from its beginning i hated it immediately but my wife became hooked on it for a couple of years for me it just got worse and worse and the characters were all without question dreary and depressing without any redeeming features my wife then grew tired of it and we stopped watching altogether occasionally i catch a clip of it or pass through it when channel surfing there is always someone yelling at someone else or doing something dreadful there never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind that was always my main <UNK> with it when we first watched it no humour the writers seem to have no idea about drama they seem to think conflict is drama and of course that is only one element of it light and <UNK> is sorely needed and actors who can bring something to it i am sure the actors in <UNK> are competent but they have nothing to work with it must be the most depressing acting job in <UNK> i fail to understand why the british public watch it and love it what on earth does it say about our psyche i have heard it said that it is just like real life its nothing like my life or anyone's life i know otherwise we would be <UNK> ourselves from high buildings or under public transport the themes it <UNK> are far from family viewing but still are shown pre <UNK> i love series like breaking bad or the wire but i would not expect to see them at 7 30 or 8 00 in the evening the programme is trash <UNK> large and should be avoided at all cost
<START> does anyone care about any of the characters in this film or for that matter what happens to them i doubt it that is the key problem for a tragedy to work we have to care about at least one of the characters and none of them inspire any sympathy or appear to have any redeeming qualities at all br br what may have worked in the <UNK> century certainly does not work in one can only assume <UNK> apocalyptic if that was indeed what it was meant to be the problem is the characters in post apocalyptic <UNK> whilst still driving around in cars using mobile phones and watching television have <UNK> to speaking in <UNK> language with a <UNK> <UNK> oh dear bad enough you might think but this often <UNK> into pure <UNK> with comments such as <UNK> are you a cockney and was that a <UNK> during one of the scenes filmed in the underground well the good news is that in post apocalyptic <UNK> the trains are still running br br the characters without exception are badly drawn wooden and more like on the lines of the joker penguin in batman and robin except there is no real storyline to speak of or if there is it is one that doesn't work in a modern setting where half the sets are gloomy and <UNK> and the other half are <UNK> <UNK> or just 21st century normal costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their everyday clothes <UNK> are big in post apocalyptic <UNK> apparently and the other half wearing costumes from the <UNK> of a fancy dress party br br the film explores the ideas of lust incest and revenge in the most inane fashion imaginable the tragedy is that this film was made at all br br
<START> i love this movie it can make me laugh which is kinda hard to do this movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations ever it doesn't <UNK> the characters like other movies out there everyone is in character and has a role to play br br the movie focuses around buster and <UNK> going down river after a <UNK> courtesy of buster to <UNK> going on a trip with hilarious stuff running around torturing animals as usual <UNK> following her crush around for an <UNK> and shirley and going to the movies br br in my own personal opinion i didn't like the buster and <UNK> segments that much although they had some notable dialogue and jokes i have got to say the <UNK> and <UNK> parts were the best family is hilarious i especially like uncle <UNK> <UNK> in the hotel was also hilarious i love the actor cameos during this scene d br br probably the most famous part in this movie again imho is when and shirley are in the movie theater lol you've got to see it to appreciate it and when and <UNK> go through the tunnel to make a wish br br although this movie moved slowly during the buster <UNK> parts the rest is pure gold i rate this movie 8 10 show this to your kids one day or even adults yourselves watch this movie you won't regret it
<START> i watched this movie so that you don't have to i have great respect for kris kristofferson but what was he thinking he did this for scale br br at least the film's title practices truth in advertising since people and objects <UNK> disappear throughout the film adding to the confusion kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn't sure if <UNK> character really existed this does not <UNK> well for the viewer being able to follow the story br br the making of feature was far more interesting than the movie itself it explores the difficulty <UNK> together funding for an indie even as the film is being shot br br to it's credit this movie is visually pleasing and doesn't in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over too bad the money wasn't spent on a better project
<START> did the first travesty actually make money this is another sequel along the lines of another <UNK> that no one asked for but we've received it anyway the sequel is like its predecessor completely brain dead it's also pretty disgusting remember the dinner scene to think i almost felt sorry for ritter <UNK> and warden did they need the money that much
<START> ok when i say wow i mean jesus please help me i have an old vhs copy that was <UNK> before troma got a copy of the title the movie is about an alien crash landing on earth to <UNK> us with a gun that <UNK> people into oblivion watch out and by that i mean watch out for those special effects there is an amazing number of mistakes the acting is terrible but i'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the sheriff the film itself is really grainy and poorly <UNK> in one particular scene it is day outside and then the shot shows the night beast shooting his gun with night behind him then it shows day again shakes head i usually like low budget horror films but i had to force myself to finish it because i never watch a movie without finishing it the only accomplishment this film achieved was an alien that wasn't stereotypical so for that and only for that i give it a 3 out of 10 br br don't watch this movie if you've had a bad day you'll be even more depressed at the failed attempt this movie makes
<START> we see at the beginning of little <UNK> needs to fly <UNK> the subject of the film an obsessive <UNK> or at least that's what he seems to be by way of constantly opening closing doors and with his large stock pile of food in the <UNK> in a way director <UNK> <UNK> sets up a central question in a manner of speaking to why <UNK> is like this well in fact he's not necessarily obsessive <UNK> as he is just well prepared and why shouldn't he be after the life he's lived aside from the most dark and <UNK> and frightening and just downright haunting story of survival that's the core of the picture the back story to <UNK> is fascinating too own childhood for example was already a <UNK> from the start being in post war poor in a family without much food or <UNK> eating <UNK> for the blue in the walls but enter in a passion an un <UNK> desire which of course is part of <UNK> bread <UNK> and love of man in his films which is flying and for <UNK> there was nothing else but to fulfill this what it ends up leading to after becoming an american citizen is more than he could've <UNK> for br br <UNK> is one of <UNK> most compelling quirky and <UNK> observed figures in his whole career a man who's memory is <UNK> by brutal memories of his time being a vietnam <UNK> though at the least it provides for some of the most compelling storytelling in any documentary of the last 20 years ironically the storytelling comes through unlike in the wild blue <UNK> mostly in lots and lots of exposition from <UNK> on some of the most minute details of his time in the different prison camps the torture tactics the bugs the brutal wretched violence and <UNK> like with the wedding ring tale and leading into the most interesting and sad portions with his best friend <UNK> they escaped the <UNK> together but found that their journey to reach cambodia would not be so easy now through most of this the talking does something that is enthralling which is that as <UNK> goes through his stories and occasionally does re <UNK> in fashion <UNK> could only do with <UNK> already middle aged being led in <UNK> et all through the jungle one can picture all of this in the mind it all becomes even more vivid to try and get these little details and the intensity of it all together into a form of reality that <UNK> keeps these portions simple and knows when to hold <UNK> back in his answers makes him all the more a key figure of interest he's not ever totally <UNK> but unlike a timothy you wont think ever really about laughing at him either br br so along with his hero whether of war or not is hard to say as <UNK> <UNK> that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes typical but perhaps quite true <UNK> his film with a mix of old stock footage when <UNK> early life the period footage of ww2 scenes and post german <UNK> is always a captivating sight and with <UNK> gets up a notch in his timing and <UNK> with music and in capturing the footage of vietnam in <UNK> viewings of <UNK> and fields <UNK> is also very wise at not <UNK> politics much at all into the proceedings there's no 'i was used by the <UNK> or whatever thrown into the mix there's even a sense that <UNK> doesn't hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him that it's just what happens in time of war and of course he was dropping bombs on people from his plane now through much of these harrowing and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of food it's always harrowing luckily <UNK> keeps a level of humor in check as well one of my very favorite scenes in the film where <UNK> breaks away for a moment from <UNK> is when he shows a film used for american soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alone with all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife a <UNK> gun and a very fast helicopter to come around and this is put to hilariously dead pan voice over work br br yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis and how one can't ever really imagine what it's like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of <UNK> in war time <UNK> aside from knowing that flying and <UNK> are the only way of life he would ever want to have and <UNK> ends the film on a wonderfully somber <UNK> note where he flies over a large field of <UNK> knows what it is to have to survive at all costs but yet as well as in many of <UNK> protagonist driven films there's the near spirit that will keep on enduring if one's strong enough even through horrid moments the fate of and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter is he american or a spy they ask on the <UNK> <UNK> is such a man with a spirit and he's given via <UNK> a fantastic tragic creative well shot albeit maybe too short tribute to his life and of course it <UNK> me up even more for the upcoming <UNK> rescue dawn
<START> this is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black <UNK> who is accused of murdering a tourist in florida and the court case that follows what this film shows is how corrupt the american police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a <UNK> old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and <UNK> it if he <UNK> in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife the star is the <UNK> lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along fascinating stuff 7 out of 10
<START> the war at home is a splendid television series and i don't understand because she has been <UNK> please <UNK> something to continue with this very beautiful television series with excellent and marvelous actors good <UNK> and good situations please we want the third series and even so many new episodes i pray you i would like if possible somehow to make to reach this and mail the interested since i can tell you that here in italy this series is very liked as in other countries of europe chest of <UNK> for example spain in effects as i have written above what strikes of this television series it is the good <UNK> of the actors and also the honest one with which numerous matters of true importance are treated i think both one of the best american television series arrive on the italian screens in these last years i pray you
<START> what can i say i couldn't sleep and i came across this movie on mtv i started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many anti drug movies do but i got sucked into this movie and i couldn't stop watching nick <UNK> did an amazing job with his character and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching i was interested in <UNK> the soundtrack to the movie or even the movie itself and mtv com was no help at all but believe it or not amazon com is taking pre orders for the august <UNK> release of the movie on dvd i know i had a hard time tracking it down and i'm sure other people might have had the same problem i'm buying my own copy so i can <UNK> over nick <UNK> while <UNK> my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline
<START> this movie was terrible how can somebody even think that this movie was like the ones back in the good old days when tim <UNK> was not even in it and to make things worse they used clips from old <UNK> movies thats just terrible no <UNK> movie is complete without tim <UNK> i love <UNK> films and i have been watching them since i was 4 years old i have been through everything they have done and this movie almost made me lose it now i got a couple of lines to fill so i will keep going their way of <UNK> new <UNK> is completely stupid as well as way to send jack back in time what happened to the chamber and finally what happened in the end of <UNK> 5 where <UNK> says and i quote jack has given me something special and her and some other broad looks at her stomach i don't know maybe a baby is in there there were so many other places of going to but <UNK> the bed
<START> this film set the standard for african american film excellence when it was made i heard on various stories on the film through time that there was a push for an academy award nomination when it was released this film plays on various emotions and you definitely feel for all of the characters sure some of the acting is a little wooden but fortunately those parts aren't pivotal the music is sensational and if you don't think the ending is a tear <UNK> you have no heart in your chest if you watch <UNK> high you will see that many many films have copied various elements from it in order to <UNK> their own films the biggest example of this is <UNK> n the hood
<START> many believe this movie is a baseball movie such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player but the movie isn't about baseball br br some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed this movie is not a romantic comedy br br this movie is about culture an arrogant american major and a stern traditional japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't indeed won't understand one another it's after they manage to break through the cultural <UNK> that they have success the <UNK> becomes more japanese in his team mentality and the manager more american in allowing individual achievement and they meet in the middle br br baseball and the romance is <UNK> to this critique of the two cultures many who have no understanding of the japanese mindset miss this and think it's a movie on baseball or romance and see the culture clash as mild comedy relief it's not the culture clash is the of the movie based on my own experience and understanding of the japanese culture i think this movie did quite well in that it didn't overly <UNK> the japanese culture nor <UNK> it in its portrayal br br overall i believe this is an enjoyable and relaxing movie if one understands what it is really about
<START> i bought this movie for 99 cents at k mart several years back along with breed <UNK> anything with gabriel <UNK> and amanda is surely worth that much it wasn't dark obsession the title i bought it under was a slight cut above breed <UNK> rated at 2 4 but not enough to allow me to even keep it in the house i threw both movies in the trash br br this thing fails on so many levels it's hard to narrow it down but let's just say it's <UNK> incredible boring <UNK> confusing and even at 100 minutes way too long br br i love <UNK> as an actor but this schlock really looks bad on his resume
<START> truly awful obviously an attempt to cash in on the star wars <UNK> but there's no excuse for this insipid piece of garbage the storyline gets lost before the middle the characters are forgettable and the kid is such a non talent that all he does is pose for the camera an alien planet they land on is actually the naval in long beach california br br this movie actually made me physically ill watching it br br roger corman has made some good some bad movies in his career but there's no excuse for this one br br 0 10 imdb won't let you score a zero
<START> uncle frank is everyone's uncle this documentary covered all aspects of aging in america the <UNK> the humor the irony uncle frank and aunt were <UNK> generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience the director did an <UNK> job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives thanks to everyone who helped in making this film
<START> of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera <UNK> could break your heart <UNK> than anyone even ford but this is one of his worst even he seemed to know it probably from its <UNK> treatment not much above a bonanza or big valley br br yet there is one moment typical <UNK> that comes out of nowhere to <UNK> you the death of the indian wife of gable she has gone to give her baby some water and <UNK> is killed by an arrow instantly no warning <UNK> br br one of the most shocking <UNK> for deaths in all cinema particularly after <UNK> a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked to be a sappy western of course the treatment of her afterwards is laden with total indifference apparently to the film even so it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best
<START> this was a very good <UNK> but like <UNK> <UNK> some 14 years later the wwe <UNK> so many matches on it some of the matches were useless i'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do br br however major highlights included the huge pop for <UNK> winning the tag team <UNK> from <UNK> and andre the giant the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen <UNK> vs dusty <UNK> and the late <UNK> and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hogan br br some matches were a complete waste of time like the <UNK> vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long <UNK> b <UNK> vs rick <UNK> was short and big <UNK> vs <UNK> was too short br br mr perfect vs <UNK> <UNK> and ted <UNK> vs jake 'the <UNK> roberts were very good indeed br br overall grade b
<START> this very low budget film is fun if you're a john fan but is otherwise disappointing at least it was short so i didn't feel like i had wasted too much of my time john's scenes are funny enough but the attempted <UNK> scenes with <UNK> <UNK> are pretty nauseating it starts off seeming like it could be a funny movie but some of the characters are just so outlandish while the others are far too serious that it just falls flat don't get me started on the ending it was totally implausible and didn't even fit with the rest of the movie i will say that i wasn't bored though which is why i rated it above a three fans of john will enjoy seeing him with a and <UNK> around his head and eating <UNK> its oh and make sure to check out john's deleted scenes they're better than some that were actually included in the movie
<START> a photographer in the small city of in south korea learns that he has a <UNK> illness but <UNK> the seriousness of it to his family and friends we never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> poignant first film christmas in august is not his illness it is the grace in which he <UNK> his life his ability to accept what life has in store without <UNK> sadly it was the final film shot by cinematographer <UNK> young <UNK> before his death and the film is dedicated to his memory br br the photographer <UNK> won is played by han <UNK> at one time <UNK> most popular star a handsome man in his early thirties with an <UNK> laugh he is so warm and full of <UNK> that it is difficult to picture him as <UNK> the end of life <UNK> won owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father goo shin and sister oh <UNK> teaching his dad how to play movies on the vcr and writing <UNK> for him to take over his shop if he were to die as <UNK> won goes about the day to day business of getting his affairs in order <UNK> im <UNK> ha a <UNK> reader comes into his store with an <UNK> request for some <UNK> br br abrupt and <UNK> he treats her with disdain but later <UNK> and she becomes a regular <UNK> without overt expression of romantic feelings their relationship develops a growing <UNK> love is not something they say or do it is their ground of being the place where they come from to protect <UNK> im from suffering <UNK> won does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the <UNK> window although <UNK> decision to <UNK> his illness from <UNK> im is open to question it feels <UNK> to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to live life to the <UNK> by playing around br br one of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a <UNK> photo of herself <UNK> won makes sure the picture is an exact <UNK> knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of <UNK> christmas in august is an <UNK> film that never <UNK> to melodrama to make its point it is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments riding a bike sharing a joke eating ice cream being thoughtful and <UNK> and feeling good about what life has to offer it is a love story where love means having to say you're sorry although there have been many films on the dying process christmas in august <UNK> the genre in a new direction and in the process offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition <UNK> this film about death is an experience of the <UNK> joy
<START> i know that chill <UNK> usually played lovable old sorts in westerns but his role in this segment is something i've remembered for a long time <UNK> could be a first rate villain yes burgess <UNK> fall was correct that look in eye it expressed <UNK> greed ignorance and the threat of violence all at once quite a performance i think br br the segment itself was a good one too question couldn't the little black bag cure alcoholism i guess it did sort of with fall but the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure if he had it as quickly as possible to br br there is one moment that was annoying but also necessary and it is something that appears to <UNK> in these night gallery segments it's <UNK> constant need to for that's what we got one more time with dr fall i don't know what was more frustrating losing the black bag and all its <UNK> or not being to stop fall from preaching about the benefit for humanity all while <UNK> greedy face in the mud and therefore all but begging for to strike out at him but as i say it was necessary at least it was for me otherwise we wouldn't have been able to see performance discussed above all done without moving a muscle or speaking a word
<START> while i can't say whether or not larry <UNK> ever saw any of the old cartoons i would think that writing said cartoons file cards and some of the comics would count for something br br for fans of the old cartoon this is pretty much a <UNK> of the same except with a few new characters and a more insane <UNK> commander br br we still have all the old favorites too but on a personal note one thing that always irritated me was this duke in charge stuff when there are tons of other officers around instead br br the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well the main trick here seems to be the cgi it's overall pretty good if not a little over the top
<START> step up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break the film is average in every way with little more for the viewer a jock fights <UNK> prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special the acting was fine but the dialog and directing had little to add to <UNK> a predictable story none the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film there were some dark scenes and some typical <UNK> about dancers that went a little overboard this is a class b film with <UNK> continuity errors and dialog <UNK> the scenery was good and the characters held true to life it is worth the watch if you like that kind of film
<START> vampires i'm sorry but even for the 80's that's just way too cheesy to be remotely scary you can excuse the original the odd <UNK> moment because it was <UNK> old movies and tv shows but that's been done once so the sequel needed to be a little less camp not even more outlandish plus the first movie had the presence of chris sarandon a man who could even make stalking in casual seem seductive that this one sorely lacks so there was no in anything that happened it just seemed silly br br admittedly i only saw this once when i was 7 but by then already being a huge fan of the original i remember being disgusted to me there is no sequel to fright night just a tacky spoof that doesn't deserve any <UNK> whatsoever
<START> that's what i thought when i heard about the cast of <UNK> <UNK> and i'm both from germany and into movies br br that guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre tv series and even there he didn't play the main parts obviously nobody ever noticed what he's capable of now thanks to <UNK> he got one shot to change that and let's put it this way that was a <UNK> he is the living proof of what a great <UNK> <UNK> is br br by the way i think it's a great <UNK> to watch the movie as a german being able to understand everything and the german dialog is written almost as good as the english br br now i could repeat what many others have written here before i'll put it short finally <UNK> is back
<START> i would agree with the comments already posted to this site by the previous <UNK> br br i first stumbled across this movie back in the '80s when i was employed at a psychiatric hospital unfortunately many of the <UNK> aimed at the psychiatric profession do hit home i especially enjoyed the ending where the psychiatrist would speak thru the door to the <UNK> <UNK> trust me its fairly accurate br br of course doors at most <UNK> <UNK> are not locked nor are used much these days and any hospital must be <UNK> to have a padded room br br but a wonderfully underrated film and certainly one that is quite amusing br br jeff
<START> not the best of the lone star series but it moves along quickly with good performances br br introduced as <UNK> sandy in the main title john wayne as a <UNK> isn't successful you never even see a front close up of him while he's ' the actual singer is the director's son bill <UNK> who away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as <UNK> or joseph br br the film features <UNK> parker also seen in the lost jungle serial <UNK> canyon and as older sister <UNK> in the andy hardy movies doing her best <UNK> hepburn really they <UNK> really i'm not al st john before he literally became fuzzy filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping head and <UNK> scratching <UNK> and <UNK> physical gestures and movements george pre <UNK> hayes as a gentle <UNK> smoking father and forrest taylor minor vet of <UNK> movies and tv shows playing the <UNK> villain with string bow tie and prop <UNK> br br fun or odd moments <UNK> <UNK> great <UNK> the trick the <UNK> scene when <UNK> sandy ties bert and elmer together face to face drags them <UNK> to his horse and <UNK> them at office where <UNK> says you're a fine pair of <UNK> <UNK> comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by ' <UNK> i could listen to that all night <UNK> we won't go into that after being told by a <UNK> you've got the soul of a snake and of course he <UNK> the immortal i've made <UNK> an offer he can't refuse br br the plot of the movie is saved by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and later saying the three magic words in many of these films i'm from washington <UNK> has saved us from the depression is that why the villains are always either <UNK> or in real estate br br the shootout sequence is taken from the earlier <UNK> film man from <UNK> edges 1932 all of the lone star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters the <UNK> of actors and stunt people and the spin on the clichés and repetitive back stories and situations this one ranks a little low marred by the inappropriate and <UNK> used singing cowboy gimmick i'll give it a 4
<START> now we know movies the excellent paper will be blue and boogie but its worth to see again or at last this first <UNK> which shows perfectly clear his initial qualities br br its very interesting to see how his <UNK> talent developed into <UNK> him as one of the best romanian contemporary directors br br of course the movie itself is excellent intelligent and professional script sure handed direction stylish photography definitely one of the best in the most serious and competent sense also storytelling sense is compelling and gripping and he actors well they simply rock
<START> i was out of town visiting an old friend after dinner talking he expressed some <UNK> about his daughter's boy friend she's 15 beautiful smart athletic and the young man is also from an excellent family nice also athletic if not as smart i told him he might just be feeling the normal <UNK> concerns however a few minutes later the young man arrived with his dvd of this flick which he had apparently been anxious for some time to share with the others br br these folks have a <UNK> <UNK> home theater set up with a screen something in excess of 4 feet and the two young folks <UNK> to view it while the young <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> its virtues almost frame by frame br br i saw enough in a few moments and with some fascination in its awfulness to <UNK> all of the most critical comments i've seen in <UNK> some here br br i told my friend i wouldn't go so far as to <UNK> the young <UNK> solely on the basis of his liking this <UNK> but it certainly seems to warrant his bearing close watch br br some flicks are so bad they're good the classic plan 9 from outer space and in my opinion the wonderfully awful bruce <UNK> village people work can't stop the music br br however this one remains firmly simply in the awful category br br second third fourth <UNK> even the best of these e g tim <UNK> don <UNK> everybody with seinfeld have great difficulty in carrying a later starring series or as here film and these were great supporting characters in their original situations br br the eddie character really at about the <UNK> or <UNK> banana level in the prior movies and never added a whole lot to these in my opinion randy quaid is a capable actor who has delivered some good performances his contribution to the prior vacation was average at best both he and the other cast members many of whom have done some good work in the past accomplished nothing for their efforts here except to <UNK> a few <UNK> house <UNK> or some ira <UNK> br br this whole presentation story performances from lead to support couldn't be worse
<START> oh my gosh this was the first movie broken lizard made as a group although it just recently came to video and i have never been more disappointed in my entire life i tell you what if i had seen this movie before i saw super troopers which by the way is a kick a movie i never ever would have watched it i had read several reviews online as well as on the cover of the dvd that <UNK> it as being broken <UNK> funniest movie ever now if they were referring to super troopers as being their funniest movie ever i would agree <UNK> but not this one talk about dry it took the movie a good 45 minutes to even get going and by then i was so out of the mood to watch it that it wasn't even worth it maybe you gotta be high for it to really be funny i <UNK> i love these guys i really do but that movie is by far the worst one they've made club dread was a pretty good movie but this one just wow i'd highly recommend super troopers if you want a good laugh but if you want more of a romance drama with a few funny spots i'd say go with <UNK> <UNK> just my opinion though everyone is entitled to their own
<START> this <UNK> awful piece of tripe is all over the place the script is bad the plot is bad the acting is bad there are a couple of decent actors in it charles <UNK> <UNK> but the director got nothing out of them the plot line has santa feeling <UNK> and thinking no one needs him any more taking a little girl across country to try to get her father back together with her mother it includes a con man in a santa suit with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder played by <UNK> from the love boat the world's largest <UNK> played by bruce a very funny man but no actor a hardened factory owner who works his employees <UNK> on christmas eve and a <UNK> race where someone cuts one of <UNK> <UNK> trying to win if the plot sounds bad it's worse on the little screen if you see this movie coming up next run do not walk to your television and <UNK> it you may want to <UNK> your television to remove any remaining <UNK> if you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes of this you may have to burn your television and have the cable company <UNK> entirely new lines
<START> the first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg 13 movies these are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad they constantly reference a movie called get leo which is the movie in a movie version of get <UNK> every time they do this you will be really angry travolta isn't very cool neither is keitel however the rock and vince vaughn are hilarious they aren't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an <UNK> leonard movie though if you haven't seen get <UNK> you will probably like be cool if you liked get <UNK> you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter wait for the dvd
<START> i saw <UNK> at its world premiere on the <UNK> film festival i had no idea what i was entering and if i'd had any idea i wouldn't have entered this is the most pretentious film i've seen for a long time it tries to be provocative yet deep with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes it doesn't succeed it's nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen 4 10
<START> but not too hip and not too <UNK> <UNK> kiss nails the new noir thing just right great pacing and a nuanced score round out a <UNK> tale filled with sex betrayal and sure fire one liners inspiring work all around kudos in to his best work ever <UNK> <UNK> ally <UNK> what and carla the best fatale in ages smart funny and ultra hot i give this a 9 out of 10 and that's because 10 should be reserved for like <UNK> bogart and <UNK> bros movies
<START> it's the story of three brothers pulling together in the midst of <UNK> and loss and learning that the really important things in life are family love trust and forgiveness the entire cast manages to pull in a powerful performance despite a few lousy one liners a great film for fans of true to life problems believable families also worth a look for fans of <UNK> <UNK> or sean <UNK> they both do an astounding job often bringing you to tears take my word for it and rent this today
<START> i was so impressed with tim mutant hunt that i gave this one a try it is the near future post apocalypse of course a wandering fighter named neo no not that neo joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge the dark one and his <UNK> along the way they encounter mutants crazed females <UNK> worms a big spider leg and some clunky robots oh my br br sadly robot holocaust is hardly up or down to <UNK> level <UNK> in at a painful <UNK> minutes the box says 90 this is one cheap flick the sets have all the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like john travolta in the final dance number of staying alive the atomic <UNK> is a combination of <UNK> filled old buildings and central park the dark one's <UNK> is <UNK> named the power station and looks like well a power station the acting is universally bad except for as the evil is a whole <UNK> level of bad <UNK> er sick she gives a performance so amazingly bad that it becomes the sole reason to recommend this film she also delivers the film's only nudity in the pleasure chamber section of the film ed french again supplies the robot effects but they aren't nearly as slimy as his work in mutant hunt
<START> like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the <UNK> that are crossing a sky they represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to <UNK> the greatest possible <UNK> br br in the beginning <UNK> and boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the <UNK> in <UNK> it seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams br br but man is not a bird life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change not even by making a supreme effort war breaks out and without much <UNK> boris signs up for the front in order to <UNK> his patriotic duty he cannot even say good bye to <UNK> for she arrives late at the <UNK> point from which the soldiers are sent away surrounded by a <UNK> crowd all her attempts to attract <UNK> attention must inevitably fail br br boris eventually gets killed in war without <UNK> learning about it for the moment his brother mark a <UNK> musician who <UNK> the from military service by corruption is eager to take his place <UNK> initially <UNK> but in a <UNK> night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms a marriage takes place which is never accepted by the family br br soon feelings of guilt <UNK> hold of <UNK> and she realizes that <UNK> return is the one and only thing she actually <UNK> for she therefore <UNK> her bad conscience and despair by the self <UNK> work in a field hospital br br when war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people <UNK> in order to cheer the <UNK> soldiers again <UNK> is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies in her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the has just <UNK> her hopes by <UNK> the sad <UNK> of <UNK> death br br once again the <UNK> <UNK> the sky drawing their <UNK> lines but now <UNK> is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one she has had to accept the <UNK> to live according to <UNK> plans to follow the <UNK> of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the <UNK> strings of fate br br
<START> during the 1990's several attempts have been made to revive old <UNK> series tried to revive old saga in form of a laughably bad which was completely abandoned after mere two episodes captain <UNK> suffered a confusing and pointless <UNK> saga while galaxy express <UNK> suffered having this hack of a movie <UNK> to its name br br if you've seen queen <UNK> you'll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way <UNK> legend tries to tell a sequel to this already <UNK> chapter also finding a way to suck at doing so br br this movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie mixes it with badly paced melodrama and to add an insult to an injury <UNK> in some of the most renowned characters from <UNK> universe br br the only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork but the remainder is so amazingly bad that it can't save this movie from being a total loss br br if you've enjoyed queen <UNK> or galaxy express do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie you'll thank me
<START> this movie is horrible and wonderful at the same time i first saw it when i was about 13 or 14 years old so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me in this movie <UNK> romero actually plays the character of the man who discovered <UNK> there are also two other actors <UNK> <UNK> plays sam who is trying to save his daughter and peter mark <UNK> plays the priest who have large <UNK> and these are the only performances that are okay the rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the b film qualities that some of us <UNK> br br i recently spent 2 years trying to <UNK> a copy of this movie and it is almost nonexistent i am assuming that it was <UNK> very shortly after its release but i did eventually find a copy and paid a pretty penny to <UNK> it if you happen to come upon judgement day in a video store with a cheesy green satan on the cover count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy a must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie
<START> i thought it was comedy what a hoot i can't believe forsythe or reynolds would actually appear in this piece of trash and then there's the beautiful erika <UNK> or whatever this piece of eye candy is called appears she put on a few pounds since her playboy <UNK> like about 50 the story line is ludicrous the acting absolutely horrendous and the tired old <UNK> that are run over and over and over again boy it took a lot of <UNK> to sit through this dog the only thing worth it was the laughs and there are plenty if you really want to kill say an hour and a half pick this baby up at the rental shop but make sure you have a room full of brain dead people to watch it with you i think that's who it was written for it plays like they were thinking of a real low rent drug induced audience for this one
<START> after the mysterious death of an old friend a group of teenagers find themselves in the possession of stay alive a horror survival video game based on the gruesome story of known as the blood <UNK> the group begins to play the grisly game and soon they are murdered one by one in the same method as the character they played in the game as the line between the game world and the reality disappears our heroes must find a way to defeat vicious blood <UNK> stay alive is an incredibly poor teen slasher flick without any <UNK> of suspense writer director william brent bell doesn't have the damn clue how to make a watchable horror movie the jump scares are irritating the blood gore level is almost non existent and the story doesn't make sense the dialogue is utterly bad and the acting of all involved is embarrassing stay alive is easily one of the worst mainstream horror flicks of 2006 stay away from this <UNK> turd
<START> with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made de <UNK> seems to aim at the well educated spanish middle class there must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an <UNK> this can be pretty annoying br br symbols and references to art and popular culture abound the movie <UNK> to the work of <UNK> luis <UNK> and the in general a certain <UNK> with <UNK> seems to point to ready what's more the main character has also a knack for <UNK> tapes with songs of <UNK> <UNK> but why all this is mixed together in a rather pretty but also gratuitous way simply <UNK> me i can only guess that it all serves to highlight the vital <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the main character who the director seems to admire and despise at the same time how all the really pretty women run after him the main character i mean is slightly <UNK> br br the movie has three parts it starts in the spanish <UNK> of in africa where <UNK> the main character does his military service apparently in the <UNK> of <UNK> then it moves on to the resort town of in where <UNK> just wants to build the highest <UNK> of the place and become a howard for the last part a defeated <UNK> moves to miami florida presumably in order to start a life but the change of places is not really explained <UNK> it is also somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the movie <UNK> into a soap opera <UNK> without being convincingly ironic it must be said that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> himself very well playing the young stud who grows limp and <UNK> br br i purchased this movie because i am interested in and is a kind of a special place in this aspect de <UNK> satisfied me only partially in jess <UNK> she killed in ecstasy 1970 this specific location was used in a more rewarding way
<START> the short film which got <UNK> <UNK> on the movie map introducing us to his horrific but thoroughly interesting character the butcher played brilliantly by <UNK> <UNK> direction here has all the <UNK> of his later films showing he was <UNK> his own voice and style from the beginning his sudden cutting along with harsh loud noise skipping flashbacks and many other techniques all are used to <UNK> the viewer and it certainly works also he is not afraid of showing violence as viewers of <UNK> will know here the violence is equally powerful and in the sequel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is almost unbearable br br the film opens with a horse being killed it is shot in the head and we watch it <UNK> on the floor its pool of blood flowing out we then see a human birth in all its bloody glory the daughter of the butcher he was <UNK> in wwii and has grown up hating the world and everyone and everything in it he serves his customers but his interior monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts he wants them all dead his daughter <UNK> who would also <UNK> her role six years later is the only thing he cares about and we watch them grow older together she is however mute and the subject of bullying and <UNK> the <UNK> relationship with her is almost incestuous bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself etc but this is explored more in the next film when she is attacked by a man the butcher explodes with rage stabbing an innocent man in the mouth he goes to prison taken from the only things he wants his shop and daughter in the short 40 minutes we see all this and more his time in prison and release back to his world because of his daughter's state <UNK> as well i think she is bland does little except stare and is under the full control of her father the film continues in the exceptionally bleak <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if you can watch these two films this one first it has some truly excellent acting but is very difficult to watch because of the relentless tone br br 7 out of 10
<START> spoilers a jewish <UNK> yep that'll be <UNK> wood again br br ever since the <UNK> part of lord of the rings <UNK> wood as <UNK> has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role playing a football <UNK> a psychopath and now a young jewish american wood has tried any route he can to escape this <UNK> now with everything is <UNK> he might finally have achieved this playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts he truly gets to the soul of his character still it isn't like wood does this alone aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a wonderful performance by newcomer eugene wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings everything is <UNK> is a magnificent moving piece of cinema br br jonathan <UNK> <UNK> wood a young american jew sets out to the <UNK> to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to america arriving in the country jonathan meets the all talking all dancing alex and his racist grandfather boris travelling across the country the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that alex and jonathan never knew existed br br it's a strange feeling when the film progresses into it's second chapter it is actually divided into four overall the first part whilst occasionally a bit funny is mostly serious and intense so when we are given a brief history of alex and his family in the second part to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step it doesn't quite work but as the film progresses it definitely learns it's lesson as this mix of humour and sadness <UNK> <UNK> as time passes br br to the ultimate credit of everyone involved as the story does continue so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more <UNK> wood is magnificent boris is so intense and strong that it raises questions why hollywood has never properly noticed him most notable of all however is newcomer eugene playing an intensely troubled character is absolutely brilliant he shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill and when his character is <UNK> with wood you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level without the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent but with him it hits the next level br br as a debut work for actor turned director <UNK> <UNK> the story is also a brilliant piece to start a work of passion grandfather himself an immigrant to america he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots he manages to really hit home the final half hour in particular is so beautifully created that it's a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye it is a moving story and with help it becomes even more powerful br br constructed with love from a passionate director everything is <UNK> is a beautiful piece a road story with a difference it is <UNK> acted and wonderfully written it's a film that everyone should see and it is the perfect way for <UNK> wood to finally lay <UNK> to rest
<START> one true thing rises above its potentially <UNK> material to give us a view of a family of complex relationships and flawed real people it opens with <UNK> discussing her mother's death with the district attorney <UNK> us the cheap cinematic shots of a shocking illness and death from there it proceeds into a look at a family system in which everyone plays by a set of <UNK> rules and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change br br william hurt as the self important father and meryl streep as the <UNK> <UNK> mother are both superb nuanced and not what they appear to be is <UNK> angry and surprised with herself tom everett scott doesn't have much to do but he does it well br br the story is predictable and takes at least one badly <UNK> turn it <UNK> have taken but the performances and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed make it worthwhile
<START> i can tell by the other comments that nobody could ever actually enjoy this <UNK> piece of crap that's the same way i felt br br the whole time i was watching it i was horrified that anyone could make a movie this stupid what is the world coming to i guess it is my fault for sitting through the entire movie ugh but it was like a bad car wreck i couldn't look away br br if you are a kid under 8 years of age you might like this movie otherwise stay away from it at all costs it's the stupidest movie i've ever seen br br <UNK> stupid the story script and especially the acting everything while watching the movie you'll either turn the tv off and think how can a movie be so sadly stupid or keep on watching from curiosity to see if things can get more stupid than this they can't br br these movie makers if you can call them that need to seriously go back to their day jobs not one of them has an ounce of talent and i highly doubt you can make a living <UNK> out such horrible useless garbage that no one in their right minds would ever want to see br br just drawn out b s don't waste your time
<START> good accompanying medieval <UNK> also the movie looks <UNK> than most b movies but let's face it <UNK> or doom has more atmosphere br br bad <UNK> plot no acting and totally unbelievable universe i am usually able to see the potential of even very bad movies heck i love a good b movie like split second and the likes but this one has has nothing but boredom and cliché to offer totally predictable from start to end oh and i forgot the lousy special effects they look more like an old <UNK> game than anything out of myth the use of a classic poem to sell this sucker <UNK> me br br conclusion quite simply boring if you want to see lara <UNK> buy the game it's way <UNK>
<START> nearly everything that stephen king has ever written seems to have been turned into a film or tv series in fact i'm surprised that no one has tried to make a mini series from the guy's <UNK> list let's face it if they did it couldn't be any less interesting than children of the corn br br based on one of king's many short stories this 1984 horror flick sees linda hamilton and peter <UNK> playing a couple on a long car journey who run into a spot of bother when they chance upon the sleepy <UNK> town of where all of the adults have been murdered by children who worship an ancient evil that <UNK> in the corn fields br br although director fritz does manage to build a fair amount of atmosphere at the beginning after <UNK> silly song and dance but before we get to meet the <UNK> <UNK> leader of the killer kids he completely blows it with endless <UNK> scenes in which hamilton and <UNK> are hunted down by the town's homicidal half <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as violent <UNK> manages to appear genuinely menacing but the rest of the children are not the least bit threatening as a result many of the film's <UNK> moments fail to work br br towards the end of the film when we finally get to see the <UNK> force that <UNK> the field surrounding the film <UNK> into a <UNK> of terrible 80s visual effects that probably looked pretty <UNK> almost 25 years ago but look positively laughable nowadays br br children of the corn might be of interest to king fans keen to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen but your average horror film fan will be most <UNK>
<START> treat williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie and really <UNK> it don't be led <UNK> by his poor movie choices since this movie really stands out hair is a musical that really deals with the attitude and probably more so with the persona of the famed peace movement of the 60's there is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion unlike the music videos of the late 70's 80's and 90's the video flashes <UNK> with the subject matter of the music in other words the video makes sense when matched with the songs so you know it never could've made it on mtv the subject matter <UNK> on drugs and being hippies but it mostly an anti war movie dealing with the senseless <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> one of the protagonists is an <UNK> boy intent on making a difference believing all the patriotic <UNK> he is <UNK> fed and he happens upon a gang in new york who are more or less <UNK> <UNK> their characters are very unique and probably wouldn't make sense today but this bunch bands together by burning their draft cards what ensues in some spectacular scenery and mesmerizing scenes involving not only the three leads but the other 3 gang members as well as a newcomer with a small child whose entrance is easily one of the ten <UNK> <UNK> of all time in cinema partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation despite their faults you come to love these people a cinematic triumph with a heart felt and grand finale
<START> if i'd only seen the poster for nurse betty i probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten foot pole but after i heard some positive buzz and knowing it made some noise at cannes i decided to give it a try what i got is a truly enjoyable movie based on a very entertaining plot <UNK> is impressive in her role as betty a woman who is sent into a <UNK> psychotic episode following a traumatic experience i also liked morgan freeman no surprise and was pleasantly surprised by foul mouthed comedian chris rock br br the film <UNK> continuously between comedy drama romance and thriller yet despite this apparent identity crisis it holds up quite well i found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story the entire cast is strong if not spectacular br br my only real complaint is that director neil <UNK> who made a <UNK> a few years ago with the very impressive and dark the company of <UNK> relied much too heavily on many cliched hollywood conventions the mood creating musical effects he <UNK> down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable and he did the standard old let's take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance trick just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots br br but the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying <UNK> in a very <UNK> year for movies <UNK> <UNK> ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000 8 out of 10
<START> i loved this movie you can't buy it rent it or find it but it's a keeper br br wonderful chemistry between and walken and br br terrific non stop action and reactions loved it br br i've watched my <UNK> copy maybe 6 times in the last decade each time showing it to someone who never heard of it br br find this movie and watch it br br so many films are on tv over and over again without any of the wit and style of this little film br br i didn't know it was made for tv my copy is an 8 track i <UNK> years ago i hope it lasts
<START> i first saw robin hood men in <UNK> back in 1994 in the cinema i went to see it because i always liked robin hood and i saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was hilarious after i saw the movie i must say it was even better than i thought not only is it very funny it's also a very well made movie with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful score by mann the acting in the movie is also good cary <UNK> is funny as robin hood and also <UNK> <UNK> richard lewis mark <UNK> david <UNK> amy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eric allan kramer matthew <UNK> and mel brooks himself are funny but the best part in the movie is played by roger <UNK> as the evil sheriff of he has the best scenes in the movie and also the best dialogue king illegal forest to pig wild kill in it a is which stands for it is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest he somehow mixes up all the words and speaks out a sentence that nobody understands robin hood men in <UNK> is in my book one of the best mel brooks films to date and i can't say that i have laughed as much about a film as this one it's just non stop laughing
<START> the retelling of a classic story is set to the music of burt <UNK> and lyrics of hal david the actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical la it is a joy to watch bobby van whose acting puts me in mind of red buttons and as always george kennedy cool hand luke who always manages to carry <UNK> in his roles br br the surprise here is charles boyer as the elder high <UNK> who would have known br br all star cast including michael york and olivia <UNK> makes this work a keeper for those of us who <UNK> people
<START> sometimes you get exactly what you expect a film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit and in this case it certainly doesn't in fact as expected the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself which like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray is <UNK> by excess drugs and over the top antics but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun <UNK> a script by carl <UNK> horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe and wasting the talents of edward <UNK> the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music most notably the elaborate <UNK> of a 1978 kiss concert
<START> being one of the <UNK> fathers of my <UNK> monkey movie club this also includes apes <UNK> and <UNK> i am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint <UNK> it is a whole summer of monkeys 100 days for monkeys to do what they do best cause <UNK> <UNK> solve human problems and teach us about ourselves br br the story is simple enough in short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants luckily there's a few monkeys <UNK> that have a bounty on their head that would get <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blood flowing as the boy tries to catch the monkeys he learns about himself his family his grandpa the local weirdo <UNK> with a girl twice his age and learns the beast way to deal with bullies is to have someone point a shotgun at them br br there within lies the problem so much focus is put on the boy that the <UNK> just don't get the screen time they deserve the <UNK> are not as talented as the <UNK> s that play jack from the m p trilogy or the legendary <UNK> that play or clyde 1 or 2 so don't watch this movie expecting to find the next big thing in the <UNK> genre the <UNK> hit some sweet <UNK> which is what the film needed more of there is an epic scene of the <UNK> breaking into the poor families house and destroys all the things they worked so hard for serious monkey movie <UNK> will want to rent the film for this scene alone br br so in closing this movie is not for the serious monkey movie <UNK> i wouldn't recommend this movie to families as it encourages a <UNK> rebellion against their parents i can only recommend this film as a rental for hardcore monkey loving adults and well <UNK> children
<START> this first time writer director comes across as a season pro with two <UNK> most action dramas are all about the action first then the story but this picture works the other way around if this is just the beginning for this director then hollywood will soon be making room for this rising star independent movie making has once again reached a new level
<START> the columbia pictures short subject unit never had any <UNK> about producing any <UNK> films they wanted to give the film <UNK> just a little more for their money when <UNK> a columbia picture into their theatres this would go double for the 3 stooges films br br men in black 1934 came about as close as any of their comedy shorts in that it received an oscar nomination for best short subject comedy though it did not win it well could have it was good enough and even those who do not number themselves among <UNK> files still seem to be won over by the <UNK> cry of calling dr howard dr fine dr howard this was the second entry in the long series of comedy shorts made by the stooges for producer jules white head of <UNK> short subjects department only woman <UNK> described in its credits as a <UNK> it at harry <UNK> poverty row br br the film starts off in the office of dr graves the head of the hospital he is receiving new <UNK> and in addressing the group he relates that three of them are passed along from medical <UNK> as they had remained there so long but the good doctor states that he will not reveal their identities as long as they <UNK> their all for duty and humanity the stooges run up front <UNK> for duty and humanity and run out of office breaking window glass in door the game was on br br the stooges took off and did not stop for the remainder of the 2 <UNK> every type of gag was in evidence from broad <UNK> like sight gags to <UNK> to <UNK> humor to <UNK> of the and a <UNK> running gag involving a public address system which seemingly takes on a life of its own and having the true <UNK> a radio tube get shot to a he got me it all plays out quite well honest the sets used were very authentic looking and were no doubt borrowed from columbia features being made around the same time there are plenty of wheel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc in evidence to maintain the illusion of a hospital br br a true strength of men in black is the high number of usually <UNK> players whom we all recognize by face along with them the film boasts of a great number of veteran comedy actors who always turn in fine performances often stealing the scene the people with names like billy gilbert hank mann and bud shine in even small parts br br and lastly we have the <UNK> the conductor director raymond <UNK> kid brother to leo <UNK> who showed off his abilities in getting this little film <UNK> the he <UNK> kept it all moving acting as a traffic cop at times what with all the actors extras and behind the scenes crew moving and outside of each other's way and that doesn't count the giant 3 man <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> backed horse and <UNK> race cars not to mention the <UNK> green '
<START> this is a piece of cinematic beauty and it shows more of <UNK> culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle <UNK> it takes everybody into a first person experience of the culture to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived <UNK> and ate everything maurice richard the book does this as well as the short and i'm glad that in all the time i did spend studying french in high school this was required reading in both languages br br i thought it was brilliant to have <UNK> <UNK> this story his <UNK> thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story the animation was good as well very <UNK> which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical <UNK> <UNK> over better days gone by br br again as a symbol of culture this is <UNK> one can almost smell the being <UNK> slowly over a wood <UNK> this whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be canadian and encourage us all to appreciate the <UNK> things of family and our roots i'm from <UNK> and this film made me fall in love with <UNK> maurice richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> dead man walking is a film not about the death penalty but about the people involved in a death penalty case the killer the families whose kids were killed the nun who becomes his spiritual <UNK> and what happens it tells the story with little <UNK> but a lot of compassion and sensitivity i have it on dvd and every time i watch it not often it's never an easy film to watch i'm more impressed by what tim robbins and the entire cast did here so revealing that it could be a documentary so compelling you can't take your eyes away so subtle and yet so powerful dead man walking is nothing short of a masterpiece it doesn't matter whether you're for or against the death penalty or even have no opinion this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure it takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without <UNK> even once and everyone involved in the film pulls it off there isn't a single scene that rings false a masterful film but don't expect light viewing to some the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable even though no blood or violence is shown you get drawn into this film and become a <UNK> and there's a character for just about everyone to identify with 10 10
<START> i saw this last night in <UNK> <UNK> in general it was funny and i liked the characters especially sabrina the acting is good and the story line was ok except for the ending which left way to many strings <UNK> and we were like what i wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better br br the film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout it has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for ash christian i thought it was good you might want to wait for the dvd on this one but if you get a chance to see it give it a shot
<START> it's okay a few years later classic network will be his true cinematic big home run but for now this dark comedy isn't the classic it <UNK> to be it's mostly awful although it has some good scenes the first murder victim being found the e r clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery <UNK> <UNK> and the very last scene where scott's character <UNK> his professional integrity and self respect it also has some ludicrous scenes scott's character's whiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist scott's character's <UNK> <UNK> character horrible <UNK> in his brief scenes and the o r doctor on the operating table to <UNK> the wrong patient because i already have one <UNK> <UNK> br br also tries too hard throwing every <UNK> <UNK> at this one hospital i e the murders the <UNK> mistakes the poor people <UNK> outside etc it might have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole acting wise scott is passable <UNK> seems miscast hughes is inspired and <UNK> through out his brief performance the rest of the cast is too one dimensional

<START> i'm normally not a drama feel good movie kind of guy but once i saw the trailer for radio i couldn't resist not only is this a great film but it also has acting cuba gooding jr did an excellent job portraying james robert kennedy a k a radio ed harris also did a fantastic job as coach jones i was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well so for a great story great acting and a little comedy i give radio a 10 out of 10
<START> inspired by a true story tale is full of 1970's feeling but is disjointed in the telling this is the tale of a black college <UNK> who ends up in at a closing <UNK> center in a bad neighborhood and somehow puts together a swim team the film <UNK> around <UNK> for the first half hour until <UNK> howard as our hero gets the kids into the pool it picks up at that point by becoming somewhat engaging though it still <UNK> about there is a good story in this and its clear why howard and <UNK> mac took part in it but the script is poor and most of the direction seems intent on making it feel like instead of making us feel anything for the story br br not the disaster that some reviews made it out to be it instead suffers by all of the recent sport true stories coach carter <UNK> glory road etc which at least knew that you have to at least work with the story to make a movie as opposed to just letting the audience suffer because its true
<START> i've read the book and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like br br one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord <UNK> was portrayed it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man the way that things ended between lord <UNK> and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate br br there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and <UNK> in the movie than was originally written in the book the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two a fine movie but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was had it more true to alexandra book
<START> my 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable tv as someone who saw revenge of the <UNK> in a movie theater i found this movie to be an extremely predictable remake of it the <UNK> were simply replaced by <UNK> i drove her crazy by being able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene the cast was cute especially amanda <UNK> br br screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> should be ashamed for writing such an obvious remake of an early 1980's flick the title should have simply been revenge of the <UNK> perhaps the sequel will be revenge of the <UNK> 2
<START> they are hunted and starving they are completely and yet they press on through sheer <UNK> this film tries to answer the question how far will human beings go to survive <UNK> <UNK> from every of this film and like so many japanese films of this time it <UNK> the blind military loyalty that pressed the japanese people into war
<START> a very courageous attempt to bring one of the most intricate books of literature to the screen the story manages to get most of <UNK> basic messages across and the acting is superb the liberties taken by the script often <UNK> the meaning and do seldom <UNK> it <UNK> to writer and director
<START> like another user i got this cheap i thought 85 <UNK> although not worth that amount of money it is a total classic that i like the other users first saw when i was a kid and was looking forward to seeing again some 20 years after the story is amazingly thin which is why it might have worked for kids but all the radio language and <UNK> stuff makes up for it it'll look good on my dvd shelf in years to come first viewing 1980 10 10 second viewing 2002 4 10
<START> <UNK> not <UNK> world war ii br br we've had quite a few documentary series about world war ii on the regular television programming without looking up any information in some <UNK> or film book it seems that this old memory can <UNK> most names entirely on it's own br br there was <UNK> in europe which was the title of the war <UNK> of one general of the army and later the president of the united states of america dwight d <UNK> it told the story of the conflict in europe as viewed by the supreme allied commander br br then there was a <UNK> in the pacific subject matter self <UNK> which i don't remember much about newspaper man author jim bishop was the host <UNK> of br br and there was the excellent winston <UNK> the <UNK> years the series was a co production of the british <UNK> corporation and the american <UNK> company it first aired in 1960 <UNK> season here in the states and boasts of having richard <UNK> speaking the words of sir winston br br it is the <UNK> nbc television <UNK> production of our subject matter today this victory at sea that wins the <UNK> hands down br br to begin with this had to have taken the production several years of carefully and literally <UNK> through thousands of hours of film the movie footage referred to here was the official filmed record taken by members of the armed forces of the united states independent <UNK> film motion picture record of our other allied partner nations as well as captured <UNK> pictures from nazi germany fascist italy and <UNK> japan br br once that was accomplished the various <UNK> film had to be cut and edited into a series of 1 2 hour <UNK> this was done with great skill being that there were so many scene changes whether done abruptly or as a <UNK> the look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project br br the writing of the spoken word to <UNK> this finest of real life film was no less amazing and unique the highly polished and meaningful <UNK> wastes not a word and at times even the description of action rather than <UNK> it the narration goes to mr ralph graves who was a talented actor of stage film radio and television he certainly gained a measure of <UNK> by way of his golden toned <UNK> of the written episode <UNK> br br lastly victory at sea enjoys the luxury of having an original score both opening theme and incidental music penned by richard <UNK> of broadway fame <UNK> hart <UNK> <UNK> his compositions are intricate full <UNK> and even classic in the true sense br br the classical <UNK> was played by the nbc orchestra under the direction of robert russell bennett and as a soundtrack record <UNK> tape <UNK> <UNK> it has been continually available and in demand ever since its first release <UNK> years ago and really small wonder for it is this musical score that is so mesmerizing to the viewer <UNK> it truly puts the <UNK> on this cake br br sir winston <UNK> the <UNK> years also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score this also was composed by mr <UNK> br br we had in additional ace in the hole in our house in the person of our father the late <UNK> j ryan <UNK> <UNK> dad had been in the u s navy during the war being <UNK> in 1943 our pop was always on hand to explain and further <UNK> any of the situations that were depicted in the series br br he and our mother the now 90 year old <UNK> <UNK> ryan already had my older sister <UNK> 1942 90 as a <UNK>
<START> i don't pretend to be a huge <UNK> fan having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics but this was a superb movie all the same i only saw the english version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters brad <UNK> as and sean <UNK> as especially the story itself was both interesting and truly funny especially the <UNK> name endings all the <UNK> names end in <UNK> while all the names of course end in <UNK> with a little romance thrown in that i though enhanced the story even though it <UNK> down the overall production with unnecessary clichés br br the plot is this the <UNK> chief is sick and tired of going to raid <UNK> and then finding them <UNK> so he <UNK> his wise man whose entire <UNK> consists of old <UNK> and tells him that fear lends the villagers wings taking this literally believes that fear actually allows people to fly and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the champion of fear an expedition that of course leads him to the village where <UNK> and live br br the pair are currently very frustrated chief cowardly <UNK> nephew has been <UNK> to them so they can train him to be a man and the boy is making little to no progress when <UNK> <UNK> to being afraid of everything in the presence of the brainless <UNK> <UNK> he is believed to be the champion of fear and is kidnapped <UNK> and are sent by to go rescue before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home br br ultimately this is a great movie with few flaws besides the clichés and at times <UNK> dialogs i thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that it wasn't true to the comic
<START> arthur miller certainly knows his stories give a <UNK> picture of what it means to live in the united states in the 20th century than any other writer i can think of br br focus based on one of his novels is no exception br br william h macy and laura dern give fantastic performances here emotionally <UNK> but ultimately rewarding this movie is excellent
<START> after watching john <UNK> this one of a kind show i had to share it was really something to watch a grown man portray himself as a child i like the fact that with every character he became you could picture what they looked like it is more entertaining when you can understand the individual freak is what real stand up should be john is real talent
<START> dear movie director br br in the future when trying to create a sense of urgency it might be best to have your hero run instead of <UNK> <UNK> especially if you're trying to <UNK> a time line for example if you're trying to convince the audience that the bad guy really will kill the hostage if the hero doesn't find her it's probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes it may actually happen let's face it though making a good movie obviously wasn't your goal your goal was to <UNK> out some garbage that will make more money than it cost otherwise you might have hired some actors br br sincerely bored viewer br br this is the worst movie i've seen in a long time i can't say that it's the worst ever because i was able to finish it it was bad bad bad though dude where's my <UNK>
<START> 10 10 br br plot discussion br br this is one of the best movies ever made and i am not saying that because i am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation those who dislike the film because they don't understand the story often criticize those who are <UNK> the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they don't understand it i don't view this movie as very <UNK> to me it is a story with a beginning middle and end people become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes i feel they fail to realize that the comes from a chopped up and <UNK> plot combined with a very long and rather <UNK> fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory because of the <UNK> of length i will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts br br the general plot diane moves to l a after <UNK> contest to get into acting at an audition she meets <UNK> with whom she falls in love diane becomes <UNK> with jealousy since <UNK> sleeps with other men and women diane discovers the other man the director at a film shoot and discovers the other woman a random blond at the engagement party for <UNK> and the director motivated by her rage and <UNK> diane hires a hit man to kill <UNK> after that is done she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to diane is then <UNK> in her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done br br the significance of the fantasy the film starts out after the credits with a 1st person p o v shot depicting somebody <UNK> onto a bed and <UNK> into <UNK> this is where <UNK> fantasy starts the accident is there as an excuse for her to bring back her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life she depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was in the meantime she acts like everything is like in the movies because she has an <UNK> personality she also in a sense kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named betty at a diner the story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in <UNK> <UNK> in reality just as she was and convinces herself that he was forced to choose <UNK> it was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party <UNK> in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party she hated her so much that she turned her into <UNK> and made the ultimate antagonist she then took the real <UNK> and turned her into a perfect <UNK> out of the movies girlfriend and used rita hayworth as an inspiration she also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of <UNK> her fantasy world unfortunately for her was a search for diane which ended up being herself and made the <UNK> die by taking her through a series of <UNK> of reality the first reminder was club which that there is no band and the <UNK> you hear are not really there this is a metaphor for the fantasy she begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings the other reminder is the blue box actually the blue box is not the reminder itself more of a <UNK> box really but the blue key that opens the box the blue key reminds her of the actual death of <UNK> because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done along with having love this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the <UNK> hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived br br this is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream it is not series of random things specifically designed to <UNK> and it is not a <UNK> philosophical message it is an unfortunate <UNK> of the human condition that is presented beautifully br br however ultimately this is all my opinion i may be way off or it may not be intended to mean any one thing there are many who disagree with me great <UNK> why does it have to mean anything why can't it just be a statement in itself what if coherent sensible <UNK> are <UNK> for artistic expression peter <UNK> for example has spent many words <UNK> supporting that idea by such statements as i would argue that if you want to write <UNK> be an author be a novelist don't be a film maker because i believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren't primarily to do with narrative and where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation there is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it i didn't understand it so <UNK> dr story or not affects the viewers <UNK> them drags them <UNK> them <UNK> them the way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing it never gets old it never loses its <UNK> its visuals are always effective and beautiful it is cinematic perfection no matter what enjoy
<START> this movie pops up now and again on the abc in australia at about 3 am in the morning br br it starts off with the scene of a bus crash in london br br the films has got flashbacks of each character as the film progresses plus the <UNK> photography of big ben <UNK> back to <UNK> what events occurred thirteen hours ago up until the bus crash br br it took me a while to understand it but it was enjoyable nonetheless br br if sean cunningham and quentin <UNK> got together and made a film this may be the result due to the flashbacks and small stories <UNK> in and deaths br br i am unsure of the main characters as it has been a while since i have seen it but a rare gem indeed
<START> roy du is not totally original as it is counter piece to previous movie <UNK> still the movie has aura of total originality some conventions of movie making are still thrown away most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time most of the time camera doesn't move but people move around it the shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions w g comes to mind in literature with same technique because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes there is a story and isn't it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind this movie is positive it is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social <UNK> one of the messages i got from it was that maybe all failures and <UNK> are not fatal after all great movie
<START> <UNK> k aka <UNK> is one of hollywood's saddest <UNK> songs filmed in france the land that loves lewis jerry in 1950 and released the following year after a five year the boys are in truly terrible shape physically however they aren't in nearly as bad a shape as the script br br this movie is one of the un funniest comedies ever filmed br br it's painful to see this legendary team the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures the <UNK> that made the devil's brother 1933 the music box 1932 pack up your troubles also 1932 babes in <UNK> 1934 bonnie scotland <UNK> flying <UNK> 1939 and so many more gut wrenching laugh <UNK> you choke classic comedies in a film such as this br br but fighters and <UNK> do it all the time they stay in the game one season or one fight too many in this case while is <UNK> fascinating to see laurel hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers they too stuck around for one too many
<START> this film should have been much better than it was christopher <UNK> is an excellent actor but even he couldn't rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister's death spoiler warning in effect the truth is that the older sister played by diaz is just a <UNK> selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs not much of a twist and not that interesting either the film is also with far too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing all in all this is definitely worth missing not to be recommended
<START> a movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun romantic and easy going entertainment instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all even if the dialogue is not exactly <UNK> br br spoiler br br when the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen <UNK> and <UNK> you know you're in trouble but those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people br br end of spoiler br br <UNK> is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful like i said above the theme seems to be <UNK> and i understand that is an element of life and love but i don't want to see a movie about it either at least not this one br br i can't recommend this at all despite the very talented cast who are left to <UNK> for themselves
<START> would be an extremely above average comic book vampire hunter action horror if it weren't for two minor flaws 1 i loved seeing the all but <UNK> blade snipes do his <UNK> and <UNK> but the whole yes fist punch was literally a letdown 2 bad no make that horrible cgi  even for 1998 standards this is mainly in the last third but some <UNK> throughout okay despite those minor i really enjoyed this movie all actors did a <UNK> job and the fact that this now looks like yet another <UNK> rip off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior so maybe 'the <UNK> copied <UNK> ' at any rate it's a very movie for multiple genre loving audiences comic book <UNK> action fanatics and horror vampire lovers so we have blade half man half vampire or day walker and his accomplish a la batman and alfred battling the undead who apparently almost out number humans who knew in a rare act of humanity <UNK> more of an <UNK> our sword ninja <UNK> <UNK> a newly infected <UNK> blood <UNK> doctor meanwhile trouble <UNK> amongst the vampires as one wants you guessed it supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it it's not the most original concept if you read what i just wrote but still highly enjoyable you will want to see blade succeed you will root for him despite his <UNK> and mannerisms and you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1 2 3 of a comic book introduction movie still watch this without trying to go too deep such as vampire 1000 <UNK> <UNK> really what about the <UNK> wouldn't that still burn just like the money they burn for weapons uh okay i am going too deep once again sit back and enjoy the <UNK> charged fun ride
<START> a better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of <UNK> some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children but overall it looks less like a film and more like a documentary woody <UNK> is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children of <UNK> if one expects a great and gripping movie welcome will be a disappointment
<START> this home movie is basically <UNK> rubbish but you have to give them 3 10 for trying the blood is rubbish but the <UNK> that kills them is quite funny and i think the concept is good and make up is ok for a home movie however thank god it was only <UNK> minutes long and the twist at the end is quite literally fight club as in almost as trash as the film just read this comment don't watch the film
<START> the clever <UNK> is he is jess franco naturally also <UNK> in on the huge <UNK> success of psychedelic spy movies like mario <UNK> ultimately sensational danger franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film as he could <UNK> insert as much sleaze <UNK> scenery and <UNK> grotesque plot twists as he wanted to and he partially understood this very well as the girl from <UNK> revolves on a man hating organization led by a funky dressed <UNK> that plots to turn all men into <UNK> slaves unfortunately for them at least the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime <UNK> boss played by george sanders all the right ingredients are well presented yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie the plot is rich on imagination but seemingly only on paper as the action is quite tame the film is also very colorful but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex there's a bit of nudity sure but too few according to normal franco standards all the characters are sick in the head so the least i expected or hoped for were more perverted undertones or <UNK> themes franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with and i must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members particularly the veteran actor george sanders village of the damned <UNK> is one of the best players ever to appear in a franco production too bad even he can't save the girl from <UNK> from being a huge letdown a legendary euro <UNK> filmmaker like jess franco could and should have done more with this concept shame shame shame
<START> <UNK> teens on summer break in a small <UNK> town can't find any meaningful ways to fill their time some consider driving to chicago others are content to drink and bully their peers in a random act of alcohol <UNK> arrogance the bullies rough up a homeless man and steal a strange book the <UNK> text turns out to contain <UNK> spells designed to <UNK> demonic forces a night or two later one of them reads an <UNK> and is quickly possessed he turns into a vicious killer and begins to quietly prey on his former peers br br demon summer is an amateur production with a <UNK> budget the production values are low but the filmmakers were smart enough to not be ambitious little in the way of special props or shooting locations were needed the acting is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the screenplay on the positive side the special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget film standards despite this the gore is minimal makeup effects aside there is little going for this film even for die hard gore <UNK> not recommended
<START> fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors he is also a very good story <UNK> mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very well this film was truly his last great story before he directed such <UNK> as voices from beyond the story is simple as fulci plays himself a horror director after years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which he starts <UNK> about people being slaughtered he decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when he convinces fulci that he is killing people br br fulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time these films i don't believe he directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by <UNK> <UNK> burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret and i can't remember the rest of the films br br nightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already it is sad that fulci didn't get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan whether you like it or not 9 10 stars
<START> i never realized what a fabulous dancer <UNK> turner was until i saw this movie she was only 19 years old and gorgeous what a pleasure to watch her dance with george murphy the story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special i never tire of watching fred and ginger but <UNK> turner in this movie was just as terrific i always thought of <UNK> as a so so actress who tended to over act she should have done more dancing and less of the x and <UNK> place roles i had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing too bad the academy doesn't give an oscar for dancing
<START> it came from outer space ii is a very good film that has a good cast which includes brian <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> jonathan adrian sparks bill <UNK> dean norris dawn <UNK> lauren mickey jones jerry and howard morris the acting by all of these actors is very good <UNK> and norris are really excellent in this film i thought that they performed good the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is great by shirley walker the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like brian <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> jonathan adrian sparks bill <UNK> dean norris dawn <UNK> lauren mickey jones the rest of the cast in the film mystery sci fi thrillers dramas and interesting action films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today br br movie <UNK> note br br i noticed this is the second film that dean norris and mickey jones were in a movie together the other being the classic violent epic total recall funny seeing them in another alien flick br br if you like alien movies and or the subject of aliens i also recommend the following films the thing from another world the day the earth stood still war of the worlds 1953 2005 horror express the <UNK> incident invasion of the body <UNK> 1978 e t the extra <UNK> john carpenter's the thing <UNK> the return of the aliens the deadly <UNK> time walker my science project howard the duck john carpenter's <UNK> john carpenter's they live mac and me <UNK> <UNK> from mars alien seed the <UNK> <UNK> suburban <UNK> fire in the sky the arrival mars attacks contact men in black i 2 stephen king's <UNK> <UNK> 3 watch the <UNK> battlefield earth a saga for the year 3000 stargate the puppet masters john carpenter's village of the damned independence day life form contact the x files fight the future <UNK> the aliens attack the <UNK> mission to mars pitch black evolution k <UNK> signs silent <UNK> the forgotten alien hunter <UNK> alien aliens alien 3 predator predator 2 alien vs predator the entire star wars saga a new hope the empire strikes back the return of the jedi original and special <UNK> the phantom menace attack of the <UNK> revenge of the <UNK> the entire star trek movie saga star trek the motion picture the wrath of khan the search for spock the voyage home the final frontier the <UNK> country generations first contact <UNK> nemesis and stephen king's it
<START> what a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film the script is full of holes from beginning to end incoherent not cohesive utterly ridiculous one of the most talented beautiful actresses in the world and i'm talking about <UNK> kinski is without a single memorable line here worse she supposedly <UNK> her hair halfway thru the movie but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop the best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor peter <UNK> lives in <UNK> <UNK> is photographed poorly to boot she looks like an overweight <UNK> who's out at too many all you can eat student <UNK> i was so looking forward to this film i wanted to like it but i think i'd rather watch <UNK> read the phone book with her own hair
<START> now i know that sandra <UNK> produced this film but she needs to learn that sometimes you need to make certain sacrifices in order to advance the story like not trying to make the whole movie about her character br br the story is about two high school students one rich and popular the other smart and anti social who <UNK> a plan to commit murder and follow it by the number just to see if they can get away with it enter sandra <UNK> and ben chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case the boys have planted evidence created <UNK> and <UNK> up after themselves so well that the cops fall for the whole act but sandra has a feeling that all is not as it appears to be br br this movie could have been a great little hitchcock style thriller but the movie spends too much time on getting to know <UNK> character rather than focusing on the actual crime itself you see something happened in her past that keeps haunting her throughout the film and we get to know all about it all about it it just gets rather tedious after a while especially when you are right in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation and then have to stop that investigation to hear about what happened to her in the past br br ryan <UNK> and michael pitt are the real winners in this movie they play their characters convincingly and with just the right amount of <UNK> if the script had spent more time focusing on these characters and kept the detectives there to just do their jobs this could have been an immensely entertaining thriller with the way it is most of the thrill is lost they should have cut out all the stuff with <UNK> character and made that a separate tv movie for the lifetime channel but i <UNK> it's still an entertaining movie nonetheless i do recommend this movie but wait for the video dvd
<START> not for everyone but i really like it nice ensemble cast with nice <UNK> from better known players like <UNK> <UNK> and strong eye candy from sheila <UNK> what really works is the bond between the three brothers try it you'll smile a little
<START> a lot of the negative reviews here concentrate on the historical accuracy of this film ok it had about as much to do with the actual <UNK> as your average war movie has to do with an actual war or a western has to do with the true old west so i think we should give them an artistic license pass on that one br br the problem here is the director clooney apparently thinks that making a screwball comedy means a do stupid things b <UNK> for the camera and c take stupid scenes full of <UNK> and stretch them out way too long screwball comedies need a fast pace not necessarily frenetic but moving <UNK> along at all times here things drag and drag and drag after you watch this movie it will make you appreciate how brilliant mack <UNK> was when he pretty much <UNK> the genre with his <UNK> cops after 90 years you would think that directors would have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two maybe even improved on things a bit but no it's as if someone had watched an <UNK> <UNK> build a and nearly a century later paid homage and improved on the concept by <UNK> together a child's <UNK> with square <UNK> br br i've enjoyed several of <UNK> movies i consider him a gifted actor but very few actors can competently direct themselves clint eastwood notably took a while to get the hang of it clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very <UNK> <UNK> the movie becomes more watchable during the very few times he is out of the frame but when he's in the picture he makes himself the centre of attention in the fight scenes his <UNK> is so obnoxious you wish somebody would <UNK> him for real br br if you are making a screwball comedy and want some romance thrown in you need to develop some chemistry between the male and female leads clooney and <UNK> have all the chemistry of pair of <UNK> sitting in a parking lot no spark no <UNK> not even a post <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who has also turned out some pretty good movies must have <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> giving a stunningly wooden performance she might just have pulled off the tough broad in a man's world act if just once while trying to out <UNK> the guys she had looked into the camera with a little half smile and <UNK> in her eye but no she kept her up tight to the very end br br of course the biggest sin here is that the movie simply isn't funny doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick doing stupid things very <UNK> like the stooges or very <UNK> like buster keaton can be hilarious but otherwise it's boring and well stupid i think i got one good laugh out of the entire movie br br avoid this one i saw it for free on cable and still wanted my money back
<START> two funeral directors in a <UNK> village english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic how could i resist my wife and i saw it on march the <UNK> for our <UNK> <UNK> day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the evening br br the <UNK> scene in the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the wait it raises issues rarely talked about in the community but i know three funeral directors and the humour is right on the money br br highly recommended and <UNK> to the writers without you all the actors directors and the others <UNK> a job on any monday
<START> overrated mob comedy director <UNK> makes the actors pause after some funny lines to let audience laugh and not miss next line seems odd this director did silence of the <UNK> now there's the way to use pauses casting seems off <UNK> <UNK> too young for fbi agent and love interest dean <UNK> is doing a jack nicholson thing with a <UNK> and he gets a nomination for it plus we have to accept pfeiffer and <UNK> as italians charles <UNK> as a <UNK> and al lewis as a mob lawyer are underused with only one line each they should be the bumbling <UNK> song score by chris is totally out of place better for a flick like pretty in pink re make this movie it's worth it but with proper casting and director and the satire will come through even the often repeated
<START> this is a wonderful movie and i still love it it just so magical and it is fun for the whole family i recommend it to people of all ages i promise you will not be disappointed the characters are always so engaging so real you will just love them the story of <UNK> and <UNK> falling in love will really <UNK> you and put that little spark of magic into your life br br i don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book i mean the movie was amazing i haven't even read the book and guess what i don't care in fact if the movie and book are so different then you can just call them two separate stories and be happy with it br br i thought the acting was bloody brilliant bridget fonda plays the snow queen so evil and so cold you just have to hate her <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> a love struck girl who is determined to find her love no matter what it takes and goes on a wonderful adventure and i just love all of the snow <UNK> sisters the spring witch the summer princess and <UNK> <UNK> they are so fun and different in many ways br br i haven't seen this movie in awhile so forgive me if i make a minor mistake but there's no doubt that i will always love this movie
<START> this is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie the true story of a guy who's <UNK> with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them the unbelievable story of a guy who got scarier when the female hero was <UNK> herself as well as the male villain gosh is this what life made us be people <UNK> themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside <UNK> i think we're not in kansas anymore
<START> a waste of time talent and shelf space this is a truly abysmal film what are big <UNK> like keanu reeves cameron diaz and dan <UNK> wasting their time being in such rubbish petty criminal reeves turns up to his brothers vincent <UNK> wedding and ends up leaving with the bride a comedy thriller romance i honestly do not know reeves is wooden in the lead and casting dan <UNK> as a cop is so dreadful it has to be seen to be believed only bright spot from a dark dark tunnel is diaz and even she isn't that good rent out something else everyone involved with this mess should hold there heads in utter shame and prey that it gets lost in oblivion in the years to come
<START> this script was mildly original when it was written in <UNK> but the poor performances and the inconsistent quality level make it impossible to recommend some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural a few of the plot twists were creative but i was very surprised to see it so highly rated here at the imdb a few scenes are worthwhile it's as a film that if fails completely to entertain if you like this sort of montage run don't walk and get tales of manhattan 1942 a marvelous film that follows the life and times of a <UNK>
<START> the use of the term <UNK> with relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy and worse yet is the pain that is inflicted on the viewers of this production almost nothing was funny br br this documentary followed a small group of stand up on the road as they travel from town to town to perform in small <UNK> br br it's interesting to note that their conversations and behavior off stage and on stage are <UNK> but sadly equally unfunny br br it's possible to understand the self <UNK> of <UNK> which the featured possess but it's harder to grasp the sounds of laughter heard from their audiences these are the same audiences for whom the lame sitcoms on tv are intended br br this was possibly the worst film i've ever watched in my 50 years of movie viewing
<START> i felt that the film was rushed and the acting was full of holes arnold was good but the main girl was stupid and the guy who played the devil was awful the story was confusing and idiotic the film had no point and was unbelievable the movie is not the worst movie but is not too far away from it overall i was awfully disappointed it could have been alot better my score is a 3 out of 10
<START> i'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie i'm not counting super bug budget no storyline <UNK> either br br a couple of my favorites are the phantom and a budget movie called the the black <UNK> can be added to that collection br br if you've seen the then get this movie it's basically a copy of that heroine it even stars the same guy in both movies br br if you haven't then let me explain a <UNK> father is murdered and she seeks vengeance she <UNK> up the black outfit a sexy skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on joan and goes out to kick some <UNK> br br it's a fun action packed movie mind you you may not wish the kids to see it without screening it first to see if you <UNK> of the pretty graphic sex scene has in it which in my opinion was a bonus alright give it an extra star grin
<START> if you are a christian or a jew hoping to see an accurate biblical or <UNK> portrayal of the events in <UNK> you will be disappointed by this movie in typical hollywood fashion people who are not even in the bible have been created for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie <UNK> role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an <UNK> father in law instead of a shepherd priest who gave <UNK> excellent advise god is largely removed from the movie and instead viewers are given the impression that <UNK> had to figure things out for himself nothing could be further from the truth br br this movie is a typical <UNK> twist on biblical things and attempts to put most of the responsibility on <UNK> for trying to understand what god wants and what he should do those who know the book of <UNK> well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie but outright glaring changes to events most importantly they will see a near total absence of god's dialog with <UNK> which <UNK> everything <UNK> does after the burning bush far from being alone as portrayed in the movie <UNK> is guided by god with detailed and direct communication br br even hallmark apparently can't acknowledge god's direct role and without his spoken words to <UNK> many events make no sense to compensate hallmark has actually changed some things for instance after the golden <UNK> god <UNK> the people and they must look upon a symbol of a <UNK> to live hallmark creates a civil war instead and the <UNK> pick sides then slaughter each other <UNK> side wins of course br br there may be minimal value in this movie to <UNK> since it may cause them to seek answers but <UNK> should stay away the twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone who doesn't know their bible read <UNK> for yourself there is no substitute
<START> plodding maybe that should have been the title bad dialogue delivered at a <UNK> pace all the characters are single dimension with the exception of one unfortunately that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliché ridden two hour drag having grown up in the seventies this film is seriously lacking in detail atmosphere and authenticity surprisingly this was produced by <UNK> <UNK> someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script cameron richardson is about the only element that lights up this film robin music is also a welcomed addition
<START> best fan boy movie i've ever watched save free enterprise br br in some ways it reminded me of an early kevin smith film br br if you do any kind of role playing this movie will likely have you laughing often at its <UNK> fun don't expect a big budget here the acting is also questionable at times but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create the script is truly humorous with a lot of witty moments worth experiencing br br the <UNK> that always gets killed had me rolling the sexually confused player also had me smiling a bit too but in the end it was just a great movie <UNK> some better moments in the lives of a few <UNK> having a great time with role playing br br if you are bored and ever got into role playing this will do nicely for a distraction a real unexpected treat
<START> did a great job nice concept well executed and tightly produced came across as a very sincere story as a fan of <UNK> your enthusiasm where jeff was pretty much the straight guy role i was delighted with how much depth he brought to this role in a simple yet effective portrayal br br much of the humor was understated and subtle and drew on <UNK> which i really liked rather than being slapstick or over explained and there were some nice little surprises and twists the <UNK> store vignettes were a delight br br when i say it is a wonderful small film i don't mean budget or quality it is simple intimate and hand crafted it tells a highly believable everyday story relax and go see it let it wash over you and you will feel good for having done so
<START> my kids loved this movie we watched it every chance we got it was fun a fun movie we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again even after all these years they remember it that amy jo johnson was a very cute girl all my boys had <UNK> on her they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with as you can tell i am rambling a bit to fill lines lol but seriously it is a fun movie and worth watching disney please give us a dvd or replay
<START> this movie blew me away i have only seen two episodes of the show never saw the first movie but went to a pre screening where johnny <UNK> himself introduced the movie telling us to off our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half ' he was right as a movie this would probably rate a 2 given it has zero plot no structure besides <UNK> and very little production value however that isn't the point everyone in our theatre was laughing and <UNK> the whole way through not only were some of the stunts creative see trailer if you need to know but they <UNK> some of the best or worst depending on how you want to look at it but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise these guys do some stuff that won't make it into your newspaper reviews and probably can't even be published here involving lots of things below the belt however almost 3 4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical even if morally but remember statement and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on tv so consider yourself warned of what you're getting into some stuff is disgusting but instead of being <UNK> by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all as a person who thought jackass the tv show was an over hyped <UNK> with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain the amount of fun i had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in it's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the <UNK> movie comes out with this movie you may think you know what you're getting but these guys are a few steps ahead of you i guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch so enjoy and don't worry you won't want to perform almost any of their stuff at home
<START> fame is one of the best movies i've seen about the performing arts the music and the acting are excellent the screenplay and set design are also excellent my favorite part is when all the students start dancing and making music in the <UNK> i can see this movie any number of times and never get bored i give it 8 1 2 on 10
<START> as a former tv editor i can say this is as authentic as it gets it even led to <UNK> producer thought to be a source <UNK> eventually in real life <UNK> was <UNK> ok so one goofy thing is it has him throwing at a tire swing on his estate total <UNK> but the main information is hilariously true from the silly <UNK> war for <UNK> once he decided to leave nbc to <UNK> problems with an agent who was not ready for big time but who he let run the show almost to a disastrous exit out of his famed loyalty if any of you kids don't grasp the idea of why <UNK> is jealous to this day see this tape
<START> satisfying fantasy with ships <UNK> thru clouds with <UNK> evil <UNK> strange landscapes <UNK> of time great sets void of reality maybe like never ending story or some <UNK> stuff if you like that you'll love it christine taylor is beautiful sword fighting is <UNK> music is delightful good wins out they kiss all is well and the cook is pleased
<START> d o a is a non thrilling thriller from directors rocky <UNK> and <UNK> br br the acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad this movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence br br are for example someone is shot near a window we then see from outside br br the building what looks like that person jumped i laughed my head off when this happened this movie tries hard but ultimately fails only watch this movie br br when you have no other choice br br my critique br br rating r br br rating reasons violence and language br br there was no rating reason available due to its age
<START> this is by far one of the best <UNK> films of recent times i'll go so far as to put it up there with ray and the <UNK> it is the story of a young <UNK> racial boy who lives in a <UNK> house run by the amazing miss <UNK> aka <UNK> you will fall in love with <UNK> a woman who gives all of herself to those around her s brings the character to life beautifully and the other cast members are do the same if i were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles i'd have to mention everyone in the entire cast br br the music in this film perfectly <UNK> with the story almost <UNK> the way it goes and what's more this film is actually entertaining it won't bore you at all not even for a minute br br i highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart very entertaining quality film
<START> i must admit that this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i thought dennis hopper had a little more taste than to appear in this kind of if this is supposed to be funny then i gotta look around for a new sense of humor if you're thinking of buying this movie you'd better think again
<START> this was bad enough i really hope that there is no sequel maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility but no it really isn't br br there is really not at all special about this movie well the special effect were fairly good but nothing to write home about br br there were some hot babes in her especially <UNK> madison and alexandra ford but nothing to see folks pg 13 definitely not an r that also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular the <UNK> to the head was the only thing that was unusual br br tame scare fare
<START> <UNK> <UNK> and some random australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough <UNK> in the middle of investigating a series of art gallery related murders but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being <UNK> the serial killer suddenly isn't important anymore when the supposed lover of the wife who's basically just a co worker of hers is found murdered and the male cop becomes prime suspect tunnel vision is a really dull implausible and tension free aussie thriller that obviously <UNK> popular sex thrillers like fatal attraction <UNK> and basic instinct the characters are extremely one dimensional and pretty much every good cop bad cop cliché is described in the script the struggling position of police women in a <UNK> full of men the shoot first ask questions later mentality alcohol problems through stress etc <UNK> even the <UNK> eating <UNK> of cops are a running gag yawn <UNK> really tries her best to make this film more bearable but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real cinema heroine the end twist is more or less interesting not at all original mind you but by then you stopped caring for the characters a long time already the scenes filmed inside the sex <UNK> look <UNK> fake and clive directing is completely uninspired what a total waste of <UNK>
<START> generally political messages are done on television so if you are a big fan of <UNK> correctness watch to your hearts content most people go to the movies to be entertained not sold some <UNK> political nonsense the hook here is the big name cast unfortunately the sum of the performances equals a whole movie that went absolutely nowhere the two best performances chris cooper and richard <UNK> have minimal screen time in short silver city is to be avoided as entertainment it is nothing more than a non documentary rambling political expose on illegal <UNK> <UNK> and any number of other causes that do not belong anywhere except on the small screen <UNK>
<START> perhaps it's about time we <UNK> 2007 to be the international year of the cinematic crocodile the ridiculous <UNK> came first about a croc named <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> in <UNK> then there was lake <UNK> 2 a low <UNK> and made for tv sequel to a forgettable original <UNK> there's this incredibly derivative and <UNK> piece of aussie horror and finally i have yet to see the promising rogue the last one is likely to be the best considering the involvement of the upcoming aussie horror talent greg <UNK> wolf creek black water certainly isn't a complete waste of time and film but it's another pretty pointless survival flick that <UNK> real life agony with horror <UNK> my <UNK> especially since i honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this ordeal but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of sheer suspense three young people travel through northern australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas it doesn't take too long before a gigantic and <UNK> crocodile their little boat and <UNK> the guide grace lee and adam barely manage to escape the <UNK> hungry teeth by climbing up a tree even though he remains unseen most of the time the croc <UNK> lies in waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive yes it does sound an awful lot like the plot of open water indeed replace the numerous unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally <UNK> aussie swamp and there you have it oh well black water at least features some rare moments of excitement and one <UNK> designed water monster it has to be said the croc looks <UNK> <UNK> and you <UNK> count down towards every next time he wildly emerges from the water the three headed cast does whatever they can to keep their characters interesting but how do you achieve this by sitting in a tree the whole time the based on true events concept obviously causes a number of <UNK> like limited images of the fantastic filming locations dialogs and <UNK> character drawings
<START> the figure of <UNK> elizabeth of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is indeed mostly associated with <UNK> schneider and the <UNK> trilogy by <UNK> <UNK> 1950s where beauty <UNK> <UNK> but also history are ever present this was the <UNK> perhaps myth for some however a powerful portrayal the spirit of the <UNK> as well as the spirit of the <UNK> simplicity and influenced much those films simply they did have a soul however jean daniel film though made 50 years later appears to be a wrong depiction of the <UNK> and her life it seems to be an attempt to show something different to reveal some realism as a cure to <UNK> yet it does not occur to add a lot but rather <UNK> the whole story of much let me analyze that in more details br br september <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> of <UNK> accompanied by her court maid she goes to visit dr <UNK> whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life the action consists of flashbacks to important moments in life yet these moments are presented and therefore someone not very <UNK> of <UNK> history may get totally <UNK> or confused much attention is drawn on bad marriage with the emperor <UNK> <UNK> the scene of her wedding night is a failure no one treated an <UNK> like that i mean <UNK> and <UNK> the focus on <UNK> being misunderstood is right historically however the points that her views <UNK> from the rest of the are not the true ones where is her desire for peace where is her love to her nation where is her charity <UNK> appears to be rather very elegant modern liberal from the 21st <UNK> point of view she foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically <UNK> had an inner life which is not showed in the film once women will wear <UNK> is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the <UNK> presented in the movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which is the film's noticeable criticism towards <UNK> empire moreover she partly accepts <UNK> movements and to my very surprise she blames her husband emperor <UNK> <UNK> for the death of <UNK> their son where is any mention in history that <UNK> was present in <UNK> relation with sophie the mother in law is better shown however the scene of <UNK> death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of cliché br br sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which i find weak here are performances although <UNK> <UNK> has her moments as <UNK> she generally does not suit to the role she looks more like a femme <UNK> tale than a tragic <UNK> her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the <UNK> <UNK> is a bit better as <UNK> and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances in general yet <UNK> does no special job as sophie you simply don't get the impression of why she <UNK> <UNK> she did despise her for the sake of young age while <UNK> for the sake of her behavior lifestyle and her believes partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough but the greatest mistake is i think <UNK> hans as was a count with pride honor <UNK> here he appears to be a sort of <UNK> thinking only to make love to his queen and the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale the accurate choice is <UNK> as catherine she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures but unfortunately her role does not require much time on screen br br a good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations the <UNK> of <UNK> is well presented and the moment of death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie it does not appear to be how it really was however the moment is good from the perspective the <UNK> walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment that is how she must have felt about it that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world another good moment visually was when <UNK> talks to her son <UNK> on but these moments are rare br br in sum it's not a good film it <UNK> a very <UNK> historical figure a significant historical time it tries to cure the <UNK> of <UNK> trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative charm is gone <UNK> is gone and history is ignored not very worth seeking out 3 10
<START> the title is a <UNK> the movie depicts barely one year of the so called marquis <UNK> a hard time for him 'cause he was threatened by the <UNK> the quiet <UNK> of the reign of terror br br historically speaking the background is rather <UNK> the <UNK> de re supreme failed attempt to create a <UNK> religion his downfall a heaven sent opportunity for showing doctor sinister machine at work full speed br br as far as <UNK> is concerned it's a downright mediocre affair he's waiting in a former <UNK> with other <UNK> a golden cage if you compare it to say marie or scientist <UNK> and he <UNK> <UNK> conversations with a young virgin about death love and other trivia there's the obligatory daring scene but you've got to be patient because it's a long time before it comes on the screen and anyway by today's standards can we call that <UNK> de <UNK> which enjoys one of the lowest ratings of the imdb is at least entertaining and <UNK> <UNK> was a more credible marquis than the aging <UNK> and it featured john huston
<START> though it's better than most made for tv movies buried alive is nothing more than a run of the mill revenge tale there are so many plot holes in this one it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn't go through a series of re writes the ending has a nice twist to it but it's hardly believable br br the acting by jennifer jason leigh is terrific as always but tim <UNK> <UNK> it up with cheesy one liners that reminds one of jack nicholson in the shining don't bother with this one
<START> my parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when i was a child we loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment this was one such movie kind of hard to review as i have only seen it the one time as a child but it is not anything i want to track down again so i can do a more in depth review the story has some old horror actor legend dying i seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top vincent price without being likable and classy he commits murders and dies but what is this is the movie over already no as some kids for some reason <UNK> the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave i remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and i remember this movie was rather disappointing seemed to have a good premise but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his <UNK>
<START> thank god for <UNK> and the high speed of it's fast forward even with that i couldn't sit through any more of that travesty when they came across the old indian asking for <UNK> i gave up and <UNK> it is this the best that scifi channel can come up with for saturday nights how about some old classics instead the idea of a <UNK> special forces unit was bad enough it seems like they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods what more can i say it was so awful that i don't think i can come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it but it looks like one more line will do it save your time let alone your money on this dog of a film
<START> <UNK> england the dawn of the atomic age yet the <UNK> of a young <UNK> yearning to experience his first kiss cannot be <UNK> by something as <UNK> as the bomb this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the <UNK> point of an adolescent male and his world of the br br 1940's free of political correctness and preachy messages this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind and br br <UNK> of a young teenager can create wonderful subplots br br maintain character interest ala <UNK> girl and plenty br br of well <UNK> shots help keep up the imagery of this era this is a very good story for anyone young or old who has br br ever been in love or ever wanted to be does he ever get his wish watch it and see
<START> how pointless hideous characters and boring film saved by brief sex scenes mad witch gorgeous desert island and brooks body the plot is <UNK> the characters are shallow and unlikeable having said that i did manage to watch it all mainly because i was totally <UNK> by the <UNK> and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end the film was well shot well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways disappointing really summed the review up in the first line but this website <UNK> that you need to write 10 lines minimum it would be better to spend the time watching another film
<START> <UNK> doll of flesh aka and psycho the snuff <UNK> this was on my want list for quite a while and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back it's never been on dvd and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvd r which i'm quite satisfied with the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed the porn is definitely real with the annoying japanese to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets <UNK> over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and <UNK> <UNK> in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy <UNK> her in an open wound in her chest this is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other this movie <UNK> the guinea pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen if not the best now i must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away this movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent and i mean in a very sick way but wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and i would definitely recommend you seek it out after reading about the movie i was expecting something very strong but it <UNK> that by a bunch
<START> minor spoilers follow but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the dvd br br held together by a wonderful central performance from <UNK> <UNK> nurse betty is a dark yet <UNK> good natured comedy br br suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder already troubled and desperately unhappy waitress betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long lost fiancé and sets off from kansas to hollywood to find him br br instead of making jokes at the expense of <UNK> mental state writer john c richards is very sympathetic with <UNK> portraying her as a lost innocent not entirely helpless but <UNK> vulnerable nonetheless <UNK> she's never really a victim despite this and while she undoubtedly suffers horribly the motives of the characters who treat her poorly are all understandable even greg kinnear as the object of her <UNK> affections may be an <UNK> <UNK> arrogant pig but he genuinely believes that she's merely a quirky wannabe actress with <UNK> of talent rather than an insane stalker br br the <UNK> ending where all the main protagonists <UNK> on the same place in this instance <UNK> house at the same time to have it out is as old as cinema itself but it works quite well here even if the shift in tone is unfortunate br br <UNK> is <UNK> supported by kinnear and morgan freeman both doing solid work and it's especially pleasing to see chris rock show restraint in his earlier scenes br br not nearly as cruel as you might expect and not at all mean spirited nurse betty while far from being a laugh riot is a solid entertainment <UNK> to something considerably more by the lead actress
<START> bad a lot a crap it copied <UNK> also a bad movie them <UNK> when loretta modern sang was lame that internet scenes made it worse and <UNK> loves a <UNK> thats plain stupid i give 0 stars because they copied the plot was stupid the whole movie was thumbs down all the way
<START> br br horror movie time japanese style spiral was a total from start to finish a fun at that but at times it was a tad too <UNK> on <UNK> rather than the horror the story is difficult to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> normal teenage girl starts coming face to face w extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of <UNK> the <UNK> are everywhere in the air clouds dirt and everyday objects the <UNK> take control of people and bad things will happen to them oh another thing people are randomly turning into <UNK> why who knows or cares people are turning into <UNK> that's enough for me this wasn't as much scary as just creepy as it doesn't have a lot of suspense or jarring attacks as horror films often do prefers to creep and crawl like a <UNK> might rather than to <UNK> a favorite scene a woman lies sleeping in a hospital room when this long thousand <UNK> <UNK> creature makes its way into the room and slowly up the bed post across the sheets over the <UNK> and into her sleeping ear i <UNK> and <UNK> my <UNK> has a handful of scenes really violent but that are sort of humorous as well for example a man is obsessed w <UNK> he gets into his <UNK> because he sees a spiral in it when it <UNK> he commits spiral suicide inside the <UNK> the last shot we see of him is w his body all rubber like a human flesh spiral w a single eye <UNK> in the middle of the <UNK> a bizarre image has a blatant <UNK> to it which adds to its charm and fun i love horror movies like this it's not about killing a la slasher films it's about a force of evil the <UNK> taking over you and trying to kill you force you to kill others films like prove that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank goodness for that
<START> in this flame of emotion we are introduced to several different high school youngsters during one <UNK> day at school all of them struggle with <UNK> finding them <UNK> and keeping their painful secrets from being revealed has the feel of a coming of age documentary focusing on students inner landscape and their way of dealing with everyday challenges gets of with a powerful opening and develops like a <UNK> moves the camera with great skill and invites us slowly into the youngsters minds and hearts a fictional <UNK> that <UNK> us all and reminds us of the <UNK> of youth one of the most important films of today every teenager should be given the opportunity to see this moving piece of film
<START> oz is set in <UNK> state <UNK> facility it tells the story of confrontation cruelty violence hate and survival at any cost in a place like oz you have to have eyes in the back of your head br br this completely original intelligent and compelling drama tells of how <UNK> life becomes as soon as you step through the gates of <UNK> city br br what is supposed to be a state of art <UNK> facility is in fact far from being such the show brings to light some of the many flaws in the prison system the <UNK> of the humanity that cold hard killers are capable of still <UNK> and the one true fact the prisoners are the one's who control the prison br br this magnificent and somewhat surreal show teaches about the importance of every life and helps give an understanding to the reasons that most of the prisoners are there this show may seem shocking at first but to truly tell it like it is such a thing is necessary br br oz is a great depiction of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn
<START> i experienced for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the results br br clive barker is said to have horror with <UNK> but this is a film that effectively <UNK> his cinema career somewhat what an unfortunate thing to happen because like the inhabitants of this film seems to be misunderstood br br barker has created a cross breed of genre <UNK> in this story it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable regarding mans <UNK> to man <UNK> sympathy for the devil is tough at the best of times but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film it becomes <UNK> on impossible cue the child the practically <UNK> like human <UNK> and holy wrath at the films conclusion becomes <UNK> <UNK> in the face of what has gone before as a <UNK> of ethnic tension and white supremacy this film can be quite <UNK> br br i pity those who will not see the film from this angle and think of it as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gone too far we have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and mr barker make nice and <UNK> some time to it the better
<START> i have seen over 2000 studio era sound films including lots of judy garland lena <UNK> shirley jones and deanna <UNK> own universal features plus a decent amount of live and studio recorded musical comedy and opera and i assure you no one <UNK> with singing in front of a camera and <UNK> or maybe anywhere ever has ever touched <UNK> solo here <UNK> soundtrack and crap 1930s <UNK> and all the kid from canada sings this bit from <UNK> <UNK> like she lived and wrote it herself and then happened to show up for a <UNK> in italy late in her career not like a child who learned it from her music teacher br br if you skip this extra on the dvd or skip ahead to the garland solo you are just <UNK> yourself since this cheap mgm <UNK> just happened to capture one of the greatest performances of the <UNK>
<START> dead or alive final the movie that supposedly brings together the three films in the very loose dead or alive trilogy and connected mostly by its stars <UNK> and sho and that each film has its share of <UNK> world <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> of violence is admittedly the weakest of the lot that none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the pound for pound guts that director takashi miike takes with the surroundings and the material here he presents an overtly <UNK> future however low key where a homosexual mayor dictator richard <UNK> has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels there's also robots in this year of one of them is <UNK> a robot of complete lethal skill but also with the capacity to love and learn and so forth then a cop <UNK> happens to be the <UNK> top guard but things start to unravel on both sides <UNK> <UNK> up with the rebels and <UNK> with his <UNK> though blood <UNK> <UNK> like a hostage trade off gone bad and with <UNK> finding out his wife and son are robots not done in an alien mood mind you just suddenly as if in a the power went out and that he himself is one as well and it all leads up to one last inexplicable showdown between the two men br br strange that there's yet another film where miike has peaks and <UNK> here sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it but there really isn't anything to take from this story except that the mayor dictator is a <UNK> with no back story who gets his rocks off making sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything remains under control he also has along with him his love slave i'd guess in the hilarious non speaking part of a <UNK> player who also <UNK> sometimes as a human <UNK> when not <UNK> away the moody blues meanwhile we get the conventional sides to <UNK> and stories and they're never uninteresting just not totally convincing enough to hold interest of course miike isn't above having some fun like when <UNK> michelle maria <UNK> in to the water to get her to swim after a near assassination attempt on the mayor or in having the original rebel leader speaking english for no good reason at all there's even a playful homage to old sci fi cartoons at the start of the film but there's nothing very compelling substance wise with the exception of minor turns at becoming good <UNK> through the film helping one couple get by with <UNK> to have a kid and mostly miike's strengths this time are purely <UNK> and in the choice of locations and sets br br it's like a <UNK> japanese <UNK> where everything still has a contemporary feel through all of the special effects and i really liked the yellow green <UNK> miike used through the movie as it <UNK> very well in <UNK> scenes and added just enough <UNK> in the <UNK> scenes but as for peaks and <UNK> one sees this ever more clearly and the sci fi movie channel level of visual effects with maybe a few more dollars put into it during the climax this contains some of the funniest material in the most delirious <UNK> sensibility from the director even if it has to get started by unbearable <UNK> the way that <UNK> and <UNK> finally meet up is sort of random and just a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie together the past two films when it wasn't needed on the other hand in terms of the sheer guilty entertainment value of a flick like miike's where one sees something totally unexpected and very <UNK> sexual it ranks right up there with the best scenes in happiness of the <UNK> and visitor q overall dead or alive final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesn't take itself too seriously and is better off all the more for its wicked <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and cultural hang ups put on pulp level display
<START> absolutely horrible movie not a bad plot concept but executed horribly cliché storyline bad script so <UNK> it doesn't even qualify for campy this is the kind of movie that gives sci fi a bad name
<START> <UNK> john adaptation of picture of <UNK> gray is a fine tribute to oscar <UNK> talents as both novelist and playwright on screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play one being an important scene between basil and henry showing that time has passed the acting however is brilliant sir john gielgud to his <UNK> roots as lord henry and although about a decade too old for the role he totally becomes the enigmatic life loving <UNK> and <UNK> that <UNK> brought to life so <UNK> in his <UNK> jeremy brett is also strong offering a touching portrait of the <UNK> artist basil peter <UNK> while not originally my vision of <UNK> handles the role with style and grace and later with a convincing strain of cruelty the supporting cast is equally fine <UNK> former of being earnest co star <UNK> davies plays his <UNK> aunt agatha with dignity and <UNK> makes a touching <UNK> <UNK> the wit pathos and tension of <UNK> work have been remarkably transferred to the screen my only other <UNK> is with the hair styles many of them seemed out of place looking more like 1970's versions of victorian <UNK> rather than the actual style overall however the acting and writing <UNK> this production to a high level of small screen excellence
<START> this is an awesome movie and if you haven't seen it you should go to the video store right now and rent it first off the cast is superb not only does it have current stars like ryan <UNK> and billy bob <UNK> but it also has your stars of <UNK> like judge <UNK> it also has numerous cameos by actors like jon bon <UNK> ted <UNK> and jamie lee curtis second off the story was quite good also it was interesting how they took a plot for a <UNK> movie and almost made it dramatic it takes the drug situation in the united states and instead of giving it a comedic face like in half baked it has a true life lesson image like traffic so watch this movie if you're a <UNK> it will give you insight into something you love if you don't do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see
<START> i think walter <UNK> was badly miscast in this film just not believable in the role barbara <UNK> was beautiful and acted her part well enough no one else was at all memorable br br i remember the tv series <UNK> off from this movie when i was a small child i even think i had a plastic that would and was great for playing with in the <UNK> long time ago br br as for some of the other criticism i've read for this film it's certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by today's standards the effects were ok for <UNK> not great but ok as for the science that was ludicrous even for <UNK> there's no excuse also the sub was awfully <UNK> i understand that the navy refused any help at all for this film so maybe the filmmakers just had no idea br br overall the film bored me and i'm a sci fi fan can't recommend this one grade d
<START> yes i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill julie andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the <UNK> in the dark production number the <UNK> to outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that rock hudson has been seeing a dancing call girl is eye popping and will certainly make you giggle br br i only wish that this film could be found in video or dvd as i would surely purchase it in a <UNK> for my home library
<START> fun movie the script is awful but the quality of actors saves the day john hurt is perfect as is jane alexander beau bridges is fair and the actress who plays his wife is very weak the story is the true star based on a true story the pace moves well and the whole concept of escaping east germany sucks you in and holds you <UNK> ending provides enough <UNK> to compensate for script don't expect academy award quality but it's a great ride for the whole family
<START> i saw this film on tv in the uk some 25 years ago and it has <UNK> with me ever since my interest has recently been by visiting hilton head the next island over from actually and reading pat <UNK> excellent the water is wide with the benefit of knowledge i have <UNK> and consider it a masterpiece jon voight captures the spirit of <UNK> and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy a hollywood <UNK> br br three things still strike me about this tale 1 the issues of <UNK> the poor and <UNK> and being <UNK> remain the same 2 education is about more than reading and writing 3 these kids were my peers i was 6 in 1969 when pat <UNK> spent his year on br br why this has not made it on to dvd yet
<START> when i sat down to watch this movie i thought that it might be slightly good but no it was a ok film not good but not bad for most of it but then you get to the ending and it <UNK> all credibility they should have just left then dead they did not leave the last bit it did not make any sense if they had something at they beginning about a plane crash yeah but we didn't so it didn't work the first bit is ok and i give them credit for that but the rest is just plane bad and unnecessary if you are thinking about going and watching this movie don t it is awful go and rent something that is actually worth watching i give it 2 10
<START> has some really good music and performances kid <UNK> and the james white and the blacks <UNK> <UNK> moon the <UNK> <UNK> mel vincent <UNK> <UNK> lunch etc but aside from this there isn't much more to it the dialog especially the narration by <UNK> williams is actually pretty good but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad no matter how many <UNK> are thrown in debbie harry and jean micheal the latter being the leading role both still don't have enough cultural <UNK> to keep this film from being a novelty item it goes for the a jack <UNK> style <UNK> <UNK> but doesn't have the insight to keep it moving along which is where the band performances come in i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting and i did enjoy it but i just expected more though it does have a fairy tale ending
<START> deep water <UNK> the <UNK> and ambitions on an ordinary man in a compelling documentary the <UNK> and archive footage are a fascinating insight to the late 1960's and a ground breaking round the world <UNK> race the personal conflicts of duty to family self and reputation are played out in one of the most memorable and affecting films i have seen i was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed the story is mostly <UNK> to the participants with heroes and villains implied rather than <UNK> exposed most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer allowing room to personally relate to the situations and characters this movie is a bitter sweet experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful suspense joy and drama
<START> i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because i am a polite person this movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which i could have done something useful for the human kind or just me br br the dialog is poor the actors never look scared even if it's supposed to be a horror movie for example the scene in which kurt <UNK> the bones of his former colleague he should be frightened but he looks quite normal the chick of the movie is such a cliché the one thing i liked about her is the dress she wore in the final scene and by the way the end was extremely predictable with the <UNK> <UNK> in the box as a matter of fact i was thinking more of an <UNK> walking around on the back seat of the car but it still didn't surprise me
<START> another stupid movie the quality of image is correct sound too music is middle the guy try make music like in halloween br br for one rare time producer director choose no <UNK> girls it is cause this movie take one week to do and cost 10 000 does it mean when producer have money they choose all <UNK> girls good question br br but girls in this movie are physically correct but they are not good actress neither guys too but maybe it's just cause the story of this movie have no value br br i'm sure we give 10 000 to some teen who like movie and they can create a better movie br br don't lose your time to watch this thing
<START> the only thing good about this movie is the artwork on the promotion poster by h r <UNK> anti <UNK> <UNK> who all looked like punk <UNK> of the late 1970s and somehow became non violent except for their leader splatter <UNK> the cities <UNK> boys <UNK> on the to do some violence on them and turn them into victims bad acting and bad plot then <UNK> on the real victim you the viewer i gave this a 2 because a few sexual scenes at least give it mst3k potential br br
<START> why this film was only released in 4 states is beyond me i thought this film was a divine story the name says it all seeing other people this movie has more logic than laughs which i suppose is why it works so well common sense also makes an appearance in what would seem to be another <UNK> sex comedy alice is getting her feet frozen in the cold when she feels <UNK> about the way she might perform for her fiancé not just sexually but as a partner and friend etc this starts what seems to be an almost <UNK> journey for the both of them one <UNK> after another leads to trouble as if it wasn't a bad idea from the start witty dialogue and comic set ups make this one funny as hell nicholson and <UNK> set the tone of the film early on and keep the promise they <UNK> other highlights are lauren graham andy <UNK> and helen slater in her first theatrical film in 10 years climax begins to take an insane turn but a simple ending makes this one far more enjoyable than most movies today <UNK> fans will see something different in his ed character and fans of helen slater will enjoy her shiny moments of a quick but excellent come back any <UNK> takes home the award for most <UNK> character romantic and funny or just plain fun seeing other people is a gem which needs to be noticed
<START> out to sea was a great movie i expected comedy and from about 10 minutes into the film to the end there was comedy and laughing points jack and walter are great together and the addition of <UNK> made it a wonderful movie that should be seen over and over again
<START> tourist trap is a genuinely spooky low budget horror film that will surely satisfy horror fans it contains extremely strange atmosphere and there are some quite unnerving moments of total dread and fear some scenes are downright bizarre for example there is one scene when chuck <UNK> sits down to have dinner with a <UNK> that comes to life and starts <UNK> with him before its head falls off there is very little gore but the violence is quite strong for pg rated horror film the <UNK> look very sinister and the climax is horrifying david <UNK> returned to make several other genre films including puppet master and <UNK> still tourist trap is definitely his best horror film so if you want to be scared give this little gem a look br br rated pg for brief nudity violence and profanity
<START> i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous although a musical i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well as far as her dancing i think she was excellent even betty <UNK> pretty much <UNK> <UNK> dancing in this film as she commented that rita <UNK> rings around her own dancing and let's face it betty <UNK> was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and <UNK> love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever you'll have to watch the film to find out
