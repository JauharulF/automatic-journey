<START> franco <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> romeo and juliet jesus of <UNK> othello third stab at <UNK> shakespeare to the screen works very well with the casting of mel gibson mad max lethal weapon and pre the passion of the christ <UNK> in the role <UNK> owned by sir laurence olivier and rightly so see my review on his hamlet arguably the best interpretation of one of the <UNK> timeless and most <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> 5 years later by kenneth branagh as a full <UNK> treatment explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time combined with a dream cast and a lot of little <UNK> which were well chosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of william shakespeare kenneth branagh the director of henry v and dead again joining the lethal weapon star are glenn close the big chill paul <UNK> a man for all seasons alan bates ian <UNK> michael <UNK> who would be cast as <UNK> opposite kenneth branagh and laurence fishburne in oliver <UNK> othello see my review of <UNK> stage version of the tragedy though he only starred in it and who branagh would cast as <UNK> in his 3 hour version of hamlet a proper homage to sir laurence olivier and his classic version of the play see my review on that one as well 5 years later <UNK> parker who would be cast as <UNK> in his brother's version of othello 4 years later and helena bonham carter who would be cast in mary <UNK> frankenstein 4 years later br br <UNK> intended this movie as a homage to sir laurence olivier who had died 2 years prior to this movie and it works pretty well for the most part what i was slightly uncomfortable with was <UNK> a lot of lines and in one scene he gives one of <UNK> lines to the ghost also helena bonham carter did not convince me as <UNK> she was too dull and unreal whereas jean simmons who had <UNK> the role in <UNK> version and kate <UNK> who did an acceptable job in kenneth branagh's uncut epic <UNK> <UNK> of hamlet were good in the role with jean simmons being the best <UNK> ever that's why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 she didn't win what a shame ian <UNK> said his lines too quickly not slowly as i expected him to in a scene with him <UNK> and <UNK> but then again i'm more used to felix <UNK> and richard <UNK> interpretations of the role and i think that they did better jobs than <UNK> in their respective versions of hamlet both done by great directors actors text <UNK> producers and stars of all their versions of the <UNK> work as <UNK> br br the rest of the cast however was excellent the scene where hamlet confronts his mother was very well done but olivier and branagh <UNK> the scene to better <UNK> to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required br br i recommend this version just to pass the time but it's ideal as a teaching tool for <UNK> grade english teachers i recommend showing <UNK> version first then branagh's and finally this version despite the film's pg rating there was really nothing <UNK> in the movie only what the play called for br br the best versions of hamlet are br br 1 sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh both were so good that i can't decide which one was the best see my reviews on these versions for more information br br 2 franco <UNK> this one was alright it started out alright with a scene not in the play but should've then progressed to the actual beginning of the play where a guard cries out who's there <UNK> answer me stand and unfold yourself that scene scares the hell out of you because you're sitting quietly and then <UNK> you almost jump out of your skin in short that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play huge <UNK> on <UNK> part to <UNK> that scene it also misplaced a lot of lines and cut others that i think should've been put in such as the line where hamlet says to <UNK> get <UNK> to a <UNK> why <UNK> be a <UNK> of <UNK> that line was supposed to have occurred in that scene not where it was placed in the film after the to be or not to be <UNK> this version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature kenneth branagh would <UNK> that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy making his version a more fitting homage to sir laurence olivier as several of the actors aside from him had performed hamlet on stage or on film many times on different occasions however <UNK> take on hamlet is faithful to the play and that's what i was looking for the setup for the final act duel was the same as in olivier and branagh's versions only that the denouement in branagh's version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions more in line with the play olivier toned it down and it worked equally well and stuck more closely to the play with branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own to very good effect br br this version is not rated
<START> when precious <UNK> aired in america i was stunned by this beautiful story all the actors were brilliant clive owen really understood the character he played i went right away to a <UNK> and ordered the original novel which is even more beautiful and which went out of print just after i bought the book although i've seen it online a few times now i had also hoped with the oscar won by janet <UNK> and the huge popularity of clive owen the bbc would naturally get this fine production on dvd i cannot believe all these years later we still have no dvd it has to be the only production ever created by the bbc that is not for sale come on bbc you have money to make off us fans here get this on dvd please
<START> this film is bad yes but had the producers used a real <UNK> it would have killed the actor it was boxing with i am an australian and i have seen two seven foot tall male fighting each other it is not a pretty sight as the object is for one or the other to kill it's <UNK> this is there way of <UNK> the herd of females and there are incidents where someone has <UNK> a <UNK> and been injured or killed so when you see a <UNK> on tv or film it is likely to be a female or animated as it is a good idea not to <UNK> actors they might be annoyed at losing the ability to breath there is a strange idea that australian animals are cute and <UNK> that is false many are dangerous 10 of the 12 most <UNK> snakes live here and most are just plain ugly are as soft as steal <UNK> so if you come to australia be <UNK>
<START> well i'd probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie <UNK> honestly i thought it was such a piece of crap i mean the actors had done a terrible acting job and the script was all terrible although the special effects wasn't a bit bad but i think the should have thought a lot harder than that i mean how did clara <UNK> get successfully put into this film i mean she'd do a lot better if she looked a bit further and that goes the same with <UNK> honey i mean her character dies and she doesn't bother to try and defend herself i mean it's gotta be a total joke she should at least do a lot better than what she an do like become a soldier or more of a heroine or something along the lines of bravery but the point is the actors did a complete soulless lousy job and so did the director and the writer who made this film they should've went into film school to think up some better ideas and i hope everyone agrees with my methods <UNK> they are probably thinking the same thing
<START> oh my goodness i would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than domestic <UNK> this soon but here it is armed with rotten plot terrible editing stilted acting and headache inducing <UNK> sorry i have no other words for it is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re <UNK> an entire genre that is this film is so bad that even the thrillers i condemned as complete failures now seem a little better br br now not only is a terrible film in itself it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it right from the main titles nothing but a blatant attempt to <UNK> the ones from <UNK> i was under the impression that something didn't smell quite right as soon as the movie started with a series of corny wanna be hip quick cuts full of gory images and <UNK> colors i knew where that smell was coming from br br it turns out that two policemen or rather policeman jim michael <UNK> and <UNK> dorothy smith jennifer <UNK> are investigating on a murder spree in <UNK> a serial killer known as monkey killer what a menacing chilling <UNK> uh for his working methods has killed quite a lot of people you see this nut apparently works following the <UNK> see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cuts eyes ears and <UNK> out of his victims so far six eyes six ears and three <UNK> in very ingenious fashion and smith figure out that the monkey killer is probably going to kill other three people well because he probably wants to complete the number <UNK> so suddenly the film focuses on tom casper van <UNK> a young successful good looking businessman with a dreadful temper and that's where the rip off of american psycho kicks in br br so we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath none of which is interesting in the least until they finally meet along the way to that a disco where barely misses unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory goes in the back of the disco club because well just because the script tells us it's a suspect place then with one single punch in the stomach <UNK> gets rid of a big guard who <UNK> the path and the guard is never heard of again does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic br br anyway after another murder turns in as a witness but smith and especially immediately suspect he might be the killer in typical basic instinct fashion smith gets some dates with the young businessman under the <UNK> that she might discover his true identity br br i won't spoil the ending but it is quite simply an embarrassment there are <UNK> some plot holes issues that never get resolved and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder supposed to be shocking and sad comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly can't imagine how anyone could not laugh at it br br at <UNK> minutes is really pushing it you never care about one single character because they are all so flat not to mention boring that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them you are never pulled into the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place the acting <UNK> from average van <UNK> to downright atrocious <UNK> and most of the supporting cast the music is abysmal generic <UNK> and the photography is one of the worst i have ever seen of course like every fiasco of the genre we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity br br 3 10
<START> this is the most boring pretentious and stupid film i have seen in a long time i saw it at the academy in beverly hills and there were quite a few people in the <UNK> who had left the screening and were seeking <UNK> there all were <UNK> shaking their heads and looking as though they had been to a funeral what a waste of time and money even worse are the critics who gave this pretentious <UNK> good reviews what's with them are they just afraid they won't be considered hip were they <UNK> this film is <UNK> bad don't take a date to it expecting to have an in depth chat at the <UNK> factory afterwards if going to see this film was your idea she'll you and hold it over you the rest of your life
<START> i think that saying this film has too many is not what makes this film bad the twists are not the problem of the film the story is quite clever and could have been very cool if filmed right the major problems why everyone is complaining about the twists in the film is that the film is just not fascinating enough to make people follow them the film is badly shot at least in comparison to its genre brother lock stock worse the characters are although often well acted just plain flat the characters don't have enough time to be introduced well enough to let the viewer get involved with a single one of them let alone understand them oh and the locations are just terrible locations person i didn't bother to watch the credits for your name get another job maybe still photography or interior design
<START> this was a surprisingly very good movie and an interesting idea however it was just a little bit disappointing in that the <UNK> was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie whilst watching it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow there were superb performances there was never a dull boring moment so totally well worth watching this one it kept me interested right up until the end and for me there isn't many movies that can do that these days i highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie
<START> this movie was fun if all over the board br br it essentially follows the comedic romp of two grave robbers in 19th century england who move from conventional body <UNK> to <UNK> in vampires zombies and dead <UNK> aliens i have no idea what the <UNK> alien was doing in there and neither did the producers i think br br but was it funny you bet even ron <UNK> who is often the kiss of direct to dvd death was pretty good in this one as a priest who turns out to be the <UNK> of a rival gang of body <UNK> br br a real joy to watch this hilarious little film and a good example of what you can do when you don't have larger than life <UNK> on either side of the camera
<START> that's japanese for spiral or <UNK> is one of the most absurd films i've ever watched a town becomes obsessed and then all consumed by the <UNK> pattern in some very grotesque ways <UNK> are cut off people commit suicide in <UNK> machines just wild and crazy japanese horror possibly as psychologically <UNK> as the ring generally not as scary as the eye but the imagery in this is more sickening than most of the things in the eye and not as gory as the <UNK> story but that isn't to say there isn't a fair amount of blood and <UNK> seriously if you enjoy horror films and especially asian horror you must add this film to your list a few parts are a little odd with the sound effects the story is adapted from a manga comic and it shows but it really fits unlike some films that try too hard to capture the original source house of the dead this one does it perfectly the most original film you will see not just this year but probably ever recommended
<START> i saw this movie in the <UNK> film festival and i was pleasantly surprised the photography is just so stylish and beautiful and the story it's just not your average mafia movie actually that storyline is pretty much in the background it's more the personal journey of a middle age man that is trapped in an existence he was forced to live the actor toni is superb he excels this quiet man the girl olivia <UNK> is the grand daughter of italian actress anna <UNK> and lives up to the family <UNK> br br if you're expecting your typical italian movie where everybody is screaming to each other in big families this is not your movie there are not you're average clichés and it's <UNK> worth seeing this one
<START> from the beginning of this film with it's the lost boys rip off opening sequence to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending this movie along at a <UNK> pace the <UNK> came highly recommended from some of my co workers who i am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me at least i hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad this movie was not much longer than an hour and a half yet felt much much longer then that the story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes maximum they could have at least filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fight scenes however someone decided maybe the director but i don't know if anyone really directed this movie that it was going to be filled with some poorly executed artsy camera shots and nonsensical scenes of the boys swimming and getting into bar fights about half way through this film i thought that maybe bashing my head against a wall would be more entertaining and partially to rid myself of this horrible dirty feeling i had for continuing to watch it so i did bash my head against a wall and i did enjoy it more then the movie i watched it all the way to the bitter end hoping it would eventually offer me more enjoyment nope my efforts were rewarded with how about i make you my <UNK> i <UNK> and then just felt embarrassment for the screen writer and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this drivel the acting really wasn't as bad as other reviewers seemed to think but even the most talented <UNK> could not saved this work and work it did on my nerves i give movies a chance even bad ones because they usually offer some form of enjoyment and this actually wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen after it was over i did feel like watching the movie stealth again and wow it was so much better this time around oh yeah case in point don't bother with this movie really don't watch a few episodes of <UNK> and watch the lost boys after having a fair amount of alcohol and you will be a much better person if you do fall into the same trap that i did and watch the <UNK> make sure to keep all sharp objects far far away from yourself you'll thank me for it
<START> i give this movie a 4 cause i'm a die hard fan of the video game series the graphics and animation are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in cg form still cool br br now the reasons it only got a 4 well the characters feel like <UNK> of wood with some of the worst voice acting i've ever seen i've watched epic movie br br the movie just seems cloud <UNK> so much so that it make even the fans embarrassed with cloud this and cloud that clouds mentioned so much that it make you not want to see him in this movie br br the villains have the award for the worst villains ever i was more scared by the wicked witch of the west br br all the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie for a nod to the fans and doesn't take it further then that br br with the <UNK> br br summary waited 9 years for this movie and this is what i get a large pointless and boring cut scene i beg the head of square to shoot the man responsible for this burn every copy of the movie and any one involved in it and create a new movie from the it would be nice to make the movie in live action and based on the original game
<START> then again i like <UNK> ray she is fun sweet fresh and such a joy to watch i have to alter just about everything she makes as i am a <UNK> but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality after all she is a television personality i think it's cool that she is so <UNK> with her fans and still appears to be down to earth the studio audience appears to be rather small but that just makes for a environment some people have posted that the show sucks i guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her if you notice the early episodes of 30 minute <UNK> you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years i'm sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well good luck <UNK>
<START> this movie is great especially if you enjoy visual arts the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful the story is also both funny and poignant at times br br people who like european films and art movies will like this movie this is truly an art movie it actually has a lot of art in it go rent it br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is the lead in this very engaging affair cast as <UNK> a young woman from brooklyn who has resolved to become a film actress although not <UNK> by her circumstances living in east los angeles and struggling with a series of <UNK> <UNK> for any sort of part at all <UNK> has hooked up with a married and washed up actor harry <UNK> harvey keitel who at one time had performed in a television western series during the 1970s and seldom since accepting him as her lover in part from loneliness and as well from a hope that film parts will be coming her way because of his contacts but these latter are of small consequence as harry is simply self <UNK> in his attempts at recovering what he <UNK> as past cinematic <UNK> in order to adequately support herself <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a taxi dancer in a downtown los angeles <UNK> row dance hall bar while she continues carrying on her efforts to succeed at the motion picture business and it is while there at the dance palace that a young immigrant from mexico <UNK> michael falls in love with her and the largest portion of the narrative depicts his efforts to please the object of his affections even if they may mean losing her altogether this essentially tradition <UNK> melodrama is given only a <UNK> budget despite the presence of a <UNK> number of well known players including steve <UNK> anthony quinn and stanley <UNK> and was kept in the can for about a year before its rather <UNK> distribution and <UNK> marketing efforts on its behalf <UNK> the pity as its solid production characteristics are firmly <UNK> by alexandre <UNK> admirably controlled direction a consistent virtue of his work and on display in this film from its very opening scene frames that form a montage behind the credits featuring <UNK> at <UNK> fifth and main streets <UNK> has often demonstrated that he <UNK> very closely indeed with his cast and this holds true in this instance as he allows his actors to create their roles while any ad <UNK> is nicely via the editing process resulting in an artistic success for the director despite negative comments from some mainstream the film's <UNK> is <UNK> spot on with a good deal of it contributed by <UNK> who also plays as band boss for the taxi dancers acting <UNK> here must go to the ever vital <UNK> although <UNK> a sub par performance is turned in a fair test for any film's quality is given when a viewer will watch it twice within a brief period sitting through this <UNK> work will be considered a keen pleasure for many
<START> this is an entertaining surreal road movie it was written by joseph <UNK> who also wrote after hours martin <UNK> excellent surreal film the film follows the adventures of a ten year old kid named gus who drives a red ford <UNK> across some fictional states with names like a tribute to luis film perhaps <UNK> south <UNK> in search of eight <UNK> game cards from various <UNK> company gas stations the film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual like the money for instance which is like blank paper with numbers on br br most of the characters are nasty to gus on his trip they <UNK> him punch him but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest some oddball actors like david lynch <UNK> jack <UNK> meat <UNK> flea also make appearances jack <UNK> plays a motel owner who when he first meets gus tells him if you see any <UNK> give them to me this is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes gus 100 and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice <UNK> while speaking <UNK> if you're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies you'll like this an odd little gem of a movie
<START> first of all i have to say that i'm a huge lucio fulci and <UNK> <UNK> fan although i have not seen absolutely all of their movies i really enjoyed almost every one i did see i really like <UNK> and i thought <UNK> was the master of this genre after seeing films like <UNK> and <UNK> but after i saw new york <UNK> by fulci i found out that he could do pretty good <UNK> besides his graphic zombie movies and even <UNK> <UNK> on a certain level br br i love <UNK> style and yes i love gore but this film i think although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films is not his best one what i don't like is that it can be confusing at times especially at the end and the fact that we go from one suspect to another and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment i think it goes too far i know <UNK> are supposed to keep you guessing until the end and the killer should be very hard to find but this film plays a little too much with our minds however i did like the scene when the witch is killed i think it is very well done and gave me the chills the acting is also pretty good and the photography is great br br although this is not a bad film i think lucio fulci has made better films than this and i think his best one is the beyond a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience br br i give don't torture a <UNK> a 7 out of 10 br br
<START> i found this movie really hard to sit through my attention kept wandering off the tv as far as romantic movies go this one is the worst i've seen don't bother with it
<START> being a <UNK> in college this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom of course my situation doesn't with natalie portman and situation but my mom and i have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights there is always the mother telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be i was <UNK> my eyes at the end of this movie reaction of her daughter going to the east coast miles away after all they've been through reminded me of how i felt being from a small city in the west coast going to new york br br the movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up it is very touching i was moved by the movie every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real you didn't get any phony sentimentality i was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie alone wishing my mother was sitting next to me so i could hug her and thank her for everything this movie is a bit corny of course but everything is <UNK> <UNK> its all about what a mom can learn from her child and what a child learns from her mother 8 10
<START> the many other comments about the film say it all just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our community cinema and it got an overall average score of 8 6 we'd 100 recommend it then for today's audiences especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards as our audience did br br the sheer power of the acting performances by the whole <UNK> was incredible and quite <UNK> of course finney and were truly the stars but everybody was thoroughly well cast for our afternoon audience the majority of whom are senior citizens the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non use of camera and sound was a great influence br br how delightful many said to see a really great film that's british still not dated twenty years on not full filled with blood guts not confusing because of bob about all over the place camera shots and back and forth through time story lines no seedy sex scenes such views were even <UNK> by some who were younger
<START> out of boredom and vast curiosity i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like the show was pretty bad br br first of all the show just wasn't funny the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying especially since none of the jokes were funny the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid who's the cameraman said i'm going to go polish my <UNK> how the hell is that funny the parts in it like meat <UNK> that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone who's over the age of eleven br br now i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience however since i have a four year old niece who watches it this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it it doesn't show very good behavior in the episode i was watching it shows sam stealing <UNK> and pushing her down to the ground just so <UNK> can stand up and do the same thing back to her i would not want to see my niece acting that rude i also don't like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information if this was real there would be freaks all over her br br this show would probably be good and funny to someone who's eleven or younger but anyone older than that just stay away from it i'll give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid
<START> <UNK> man this movie is awful br br this kind of tripe is what gives canadian cinema a bad name or no name well to be fair i guess most canadian movies give canadian cinema a bad name br br next to the characters there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie it's like a drunken <UNK> making its way to die br br thank goodness <UNK> is nice to look at she's the only thing that kept me watching unfortunately the rest of the movie kept <UNK> br br good for a laugh though if you're having a bad canadian movie night though br br did i mention <UNK> the only good point too bad they didn't have the sense to keep the camera on her for more than a blink at a time br br another addition in the canadian hall of <UNK> movies
<START> i channel <UNK> past this many times mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy so love american style however it turned out to be quite good very well done the two stand out features are the dialog and acting great cast the premise is actually well executed and there aren't too many weak moments i guess what i was most amazed by was how often you thought the <UNK> are going to come off the <UNK> and instead the <UNK> just banks the turns so to speak and the movie keeps flying there are some nice little sub plots particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former conan sidekick andy <UNK> also want to mention that the music accompanying it was good
<START> www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> an excellent tv series that should be captured on dvd this was a show i rarely missed i found a <UNK> to bring it back on dvd i recall one show where this <UNK> lady wore a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her needless to say she could not eat her friends so she <UNK> to death another episode had an <UNK> visiting an underground <UNK> subway security branch the <UNK> wanted to shut down the funding for the project as it turns out the security branch was <UNK> to fight the <UNK> creatures that lived in the dark www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this one man show may be the most fantastic show i've ever seen to call this simply a stand up act is to do it a great injustice there is a <UNK> reason that this was a broadway show john <UNK> is a master of making people of every culture feel at home listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general i would <UNK> this show to anyone as long as they can handle the language
<START> i was hoping this would be of the <UNK> of <UNK> boot and echo the stark realism created by acclaimed german director <UNK> <UNK> in her documentaries sadly i was <UNK> disappointed the story line is implausible and defies <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> is shot down and somehow finds his way to a hospital in <UNK> anna a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to become engaged to a doctor she works with falls in love with the <UNK> and they make love the next evening at a lavish engagement party the <UNK> turns up disguised as a german officer and dances with anna although well directed and acted to me it is soap opera of the lowest order
<START> the director of directed the first indian film i had seen <UNK> se which led me down the path of buying well over hindi dvds in the br br course of four months i can say i understood the total attraction i was br br somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos it was an excellent movie i didn't know what to make of the dancing and the female br br <UNK> were a bit shrill for my western ears but somehow i found <UNK> score hypnotic i bought the soundtrack the following day and then <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the following week and with the exception of <UNK> the br br killer a few other korean films i can't be bothered to watch much else kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict <UNK> of hong kong horror br br and action science fiction films for the past 30 years br br but i should get back to it is one of the <UNK> latest efforts and i laughed cried got totally mad terrified and most of all i didn't feel manipulated the acting was superb the photography was beautiful i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting the music fit the movie perfectly and after the br br credits rolled i wanted to watch again so i did br br it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop this is what great film is all about i stood and <UNK> in my home theater when it was over br br my wife is watching now and i can't wait for her reaction i can't expect it will be anything less than mine
<START> this movie is awful if you're considering to see this movie two words do not it's tasteless the storyline is really lame and the jokes are even worse the acting is really pathetic i can't believe that this movie was made rather watch american pie going greek or road trip if you're in the mood for a teen comedy it's about two girls who head for <UNK> on their spring break as usual they didn't do much planning and called i think her names michelle 's uncle to crash at his <UNK> mansion uncle <UNK> strictly <UNK> them of having any kind of party and as you would of guessed they go ahead and do it please i urge you do not see this movie
<START> the incident is by far the director dustin best film which isn't saying much in his past films and i use the term films loosely the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely <UNK> them the incident is no different the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production the film is <UNK> with out of focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble <UNK> most high school computer animation classes for example almost every on screen explosion is the same fire effect <UNK> over the screen br br the weak effects and production value are only <UNK> by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue in a sentence the story strings together like an exposition of <UNK> hollywood clichés the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate next a bus of prison <UNK> carrying the worst of the worst from across the state is <UNK> by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with <UNK> <UNK> the prisoners escape and run into the town of where they encounter the aliens who shock have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy the prisoners and their captive police armed with only guns and sad <UNK> have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance rolls eyes bombs the city into oblivion br br the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors who are clearly <UNK> by the script are given the freedom to <UNK> and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a <UNK> of gun fire other than that the movie really isn't worth anyone's time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of how awful was it let's just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old works in a room that is about as high tech 1950's real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie yes if that wasn't clear enough before the man in charge of the <UNK> is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it the movie basically <UNK> did i say <UNK> with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship yeah br br the movie has heart but is <UNK> with horrible direction and even worse camera work someone seriously needed to slap the <UNK> and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive <UNK> chest level shots this movie really isn't worth renting if it ever makes it that far being that it's not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which <UNK> the laugh ability but it's nowhere near watchable cinema
<START> at first i couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary the day after i had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation the film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists including life on earth the lead is clueless and cold he is like all of us he wants to get rich to laugh to travel to eat and be entertained he moves from one place to another in a giant <UNK> without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself by the end it's too late since my first viewing of usa it had grown on me like a <UNK> fit dream where life on earth is nothing but a weird experience i am an artist and a <UNK> and this film <UNK> to my senses it was an ideal <UNK> of <UNK> this may sound strange but somehow this film was able to touch me in a profound way like no other i recommend it
<START> this thriller has so many twists and turns it had me on the edge of my seat i saw it on video some of the landscape at the <UNK> might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen cast has sandra <UNK> ben chaplin from the truth about cats dogs michael pitt henry parker in <UNK> creek and ryan <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is set in korea starts as a drunken <UNK> oh min <UNK> is <UNK> out of the police station by his friend only to be <UNK> <UNK> wakes up finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years <UNK> is fed looked after by his unknown <UNK> but is never allowed out of the room <UNK> begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he <UNK> to do by <UNK> away the <UNK> from the with a however before <UNK> finishes he is <UNK> rendered unconscious when he wakes up <UNK> finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed all <UNK> up <UNK> instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him after meeting the pretty <UNK> <UNK> the two fall in love together with her help <UNK> finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price br br this south korean production was co written directed by chan <UNK> park has gotten any number of glowing reviews the sort that <UNK> can pick quotes out <UNK> them on the video box even won the grand prize of the jury at cannes while it was also nominated for the golden palm so surely <UNK> is a true classic well not for me it isn't since as i can't understand why it's so liked i would go as far as to say i pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments for a start i couldn't get into the story at all i just didn't like it as i thought it was slow boring while many out there would have you believe <UNK> has the <UNK> most shocking twist ever i thought it was rather plain not very well executed either the ending in which <UNK> goes to the new zealand <UNK> to be <UNK> feels <UNK> on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending at almost two hours i almost fell asleep i was so bored the violence is tame it's the thought of what's happening that i would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown in fact <UNK> has a very low body count of about seven one mild sex scene it's really not that graphic or memorable i didn't warm to any of the character's while i accept <UNK> has an alright concept premise it fails to deliver it's one film that i will never understand why so many people seem to like br br based on a japanese manga of the same name <UNK> the film looks alright there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone <UNK> about the <UNK> fight that takes place in one continuous shot i was pretty <UNK> thought the fight choreography was quite dull the actual on screen gore violence amounts to very little <UNK> eats a live <UNK> which is apparently quite normal in korea anyway there are some fight scenes a severed hand <UNK> teeth are pulled out there's a bit of blood at the end br br the budget was supposedly around the 4 000 000 mark which is actually a fair bit filmed in south korea new zealand the acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language br br <UNK> is a film that i found an absolute chore to sit through i don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as i followed the thing perfectly but i just didn't like any of it it's as simple straightforward as that apparently the second in director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> revenge trilogy which also includes sympathy for mr vengeance 2002 lady vengeance 2005

<START> if this is the author's and director's idea of a slice of life they are <UNK> manic a sad moody film at best with <UNK> and unhappy characters who <UNK> interact with disastrous results this film is billed as a comedy what was so funny about losing your home to an allegedly <UNK> <UNK> or the drug induced <UNK> rape of one of the main characters is this art imitating life jack black was mildly amusing as the mountain man <UNK> farmer however even this segment of the film was <UNK> with pathos what was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with an <UNK> if <UNK> character was so paranoid why was he doing acid with a group of people right out of <UNK> is there no end to <UNK> relationships a plot less script and scene transitions lacking any <UNK> or logical <UNK>
<START> i've got as much <UNK> as the next bloke and <UNK> welch at her finest is certainly worth a look but the fact is that a cardboard cut out could act better and an hour and half of ms w showing off her considerable <UNK> does not a movie make br br considering the cast it's surprising that it's as bad as it is i've never been a big fan of wagner and his tough guy harry is about as convincing as a 9 dollar bill <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> de <UNK> both of whom i usually enjoy seem to be sleeping through their lines and as for edward g well i can only assume he was there for the paycheck br br this film is a mess from non existent plot through stop start action and unfunny script to <UNK> slapstick and annoying 60's music if it weren't for miss welch i'd have given it a 0 br br that said she is a treat to the eyes even better than her delicious cameo in <UNK> and for that reason alone i gave it a 3
<START> ya know the concept of guilty pleasures yeah you have 'em like <UNK> you watched and enjoyed <UNK> battlestar galactica after they reached earth v the series charlie's angels <UNK> <UNK> the 1950s version of superman or godzilla movies br br here's the ultimate in guilty pleasures coupled with jack of all <UNK> in a sam <UNK> action packed hour this half hour <UNK> is fast paced easy to follow and loaded with fun to watch clad babes br br the man that brought us evil dead <UNK> <UNK> and the adventures of <UNK> county jr does it again with this 2000 update of <UNK> angels we got charlie voice an unknown being that has the and the time to find people who need help <UNK> the gadget man and three gorgeous babes that kick a for a living br br and oh what a living
<START> i still can't <UNK> that made this film back in 1934 animation is simply perfect and what is amazing about it with all the advanced technology we have nowadays there are few animation studios that are capable of producing a little gem like this one it has everything a great story beautiful although this is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases special effects well it is definitely not a kid's movie but it's a must see for anyone seriously interested in animation
<START> i saw this movie with hopes of a good laugh but when i watched it i didn't stop laughing for weeks they are such bad actors and it made this movie so much funnier to watch btw ryan <UNK> didn't eat the toy car he shoved it up his ass the random appearances from the <UNK> and parts were great <UNK> some <UNK> <UNK> no your <UNK> are at the store i wouldn't recommend any one under 13 to watch it frankly they wouldn't understand half of the jokes in or what they are talking about i love and after watching this movie i couldn't help but go buy it or the <UNK> la <UNK> series what is the deal with this stupid comment thing it has to be 10 lines what kind of bull is that i should be able to write one as long or in this case as short as i want i'm just going to keep <UNK> until it tells me i can actually send it its just a waste of time i expected to just say what i wanted it wasn't too much but then i'm told i have to keep putting more in and then it <UNK> my spelling so what if i didn't spell something right you get what i mean still this is ridiculously long br br those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't

<START> this review is for the uk dvd three disc box set disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior chasing jamie and fast and curious disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special falling in lust again and love <UNK> no 10 the final disc is called anything goes and contains she's the boss and <UNK> yours why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the <UNK> for a lot more material br br each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe lauren hayes reading a letter from a satisfied <UNK> we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines for instance model behavior is about two models <UNK> for the attention of the photo crew falling in lust again is about a man and woman who <UNK> and <UNK> their love when they meet up again at the hotel she's the boss is about a put upon male secretary <UNK> who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised much to her pleasure all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex br br it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome <UNK> even the geeky <UNK> get transformed when they remove their <UNK> and let their hair down the sex action is <UNK> but to me seems too frantic and false the camera work could also have done with a bit of <UNK> spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything and as usual we get loud music during the sex action finally the end credits mention the palm hotel singer island florida although my map of florida shows no singer island the scenery certainly looks more like florida than <UNK> or las vegas that some people have mentioned this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release 4 stars
<START> why was this movie ever made they have <UNK> the original <UNK> with this crap i was only able to watch half of it and i didn't laugh once at least i didn't pay to see it because it was on t v but i won't get back that hour of my life that i spent watching this dreadful mess there wasn't one original star from the first except for chevy chase and he probably regrets doing this film jackie mason was supposed to be the outrageous funny <UNK> like rodney <UNK> was in the first but jackie mason wasn't funny at all jackie mason is no rodney <UNK> if you want laugh watch the first <UNK> if you like terrible movie's then this you're movie this movie stinks like a <UNK> in july avoid at all cost
<START> radio will have you laughing crying feeling this story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to view there's enough for both cuba gooding jr portrays the title character to perfection his performance is worthy of an academy award nomination the compassion of the movie is obvious the movie evokes many emotions i sincerely enjoyed this film
<START> one of the worst arnold movies i've seen special effects were terrible script was horrible hopefully his next movie will be much better like <UNK> total recall true lies and <UNK> not as good as the rest watch <UNK> if you want to see an apocalyptic future movie it's much better
<START> i recently viewed a copy of this under the title <UNK> <UNK> talk about dreadful any movie ed wood ever put out looks like oscar material compared to this laughable <UNK> to be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as these people cannibals don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me classic the mad type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film he really did look like a <UNK> i think he was the only actor not to be dubbed in badly if these italians must have american characters in their films why dont they get americans to dub in the dialogue instead of english people trying their best to sound like annie <UNK> i'll give this 3 out of 10 i'll give it three because it really is funnier than most comedies out these days
<START> this one hardly <UNK> to the space adventures of its time those being star wars and star trek and while i am no fan of star trek i recognize that this film <UNK> in comparison to the series <UNK> <UNK> over in fact i would place back to the future in better light in terms of space and travel br br the story is of a boy who is captured by space <UNK> pirates in a obviously fake and <UNK> battle the captured boy befriends the pirates and even helps them and slowly one by one those <UNK> die off in the end the boy gets to return home and the last remaining pirates escapes <UNK> wounded br br the acting wasn't that great but what really is obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue effects and storyline how they even got 80 minutes of this is beyond me br br if you want to take a shot at it because it involves space go ahead but be warned d
<START> i just finished screening el <UNK> in germany a great film we look forward to seeing more films from mr in the future it was wonderful to see such a well put together film with such suspense and a story that shall remain an instant classic the ending with little ambiguity leaves the story open for a sequel seeing a film with great quality truly <UNK> serious potential and his <UNK> skill as a writer actor director and filmmaker has impressed many with his <UNK> performance in blood in and blood out and now he has proved to all who have see his works his potential to become a <UNK> acclaimed film maker with genuine artistic control something that few film makers can afford
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he's found himself only to find out that he's not so sure he found the right guy if you think that all gay comedies are the same check this one out although the movie ends without much resolution the hilarious one liners peculiar situations and quirky characters are sure to satisfy
<START> remake of the classic 1951 the thing from another world 12 men are in a completely isolated station in they are <UNK> by a thing from outer space it <UNK> and completely <UNK> anything it chooses to it starts off as a dog but gets loose and has a chance to <UNK> any of the men soon nobody <UNK> anyone else they're isolated the radio is destroyed their helicopter likewise what are they going to do br br the 1951 film had the thing just be a big super human monster that movie was scary this one is too but the story is different and based more closely on the source material the <UNK> who goes there and it's scary in a different way the movie starts right off with <UNK> <UNK> extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and when the thing gets attacked the amount of gore is astounding there's blood and body parts flying all over arms are bitten off heads <UNK> and in the strongest one one man is <UNK> face first by the thing the gore effects are strong and real nightmare material i don't scare easy but i had to sleep with the lights on when i saw this originally back in 1982 rob effects are just incredible how this picture got by with an r rating is beyond me br br it also has a very creepy feel gore aside it is very suspenseful you're not sure who is what and carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension one complaint no one is given any distinctive personality traits they actors just remain straight faced and say their lines that's annoying but the movie still works br br this was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 it <UNK> with e t and many critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie it's now considered one of john carpenter's best a must see for strong <UNK> not a date film br br an amusing note when this was released universal sent a note along with all <UNK> of the film they suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an <UNK> near the rest rooms they were afraid that people would be so <UNK> by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up
<START> i'm from ireland and i thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any brad pitt or other american doing the accent furthermore i have rarely seen any british actor handle an american or canadian accent except for colin <UNK> in minority report this film is a little film and it was entertaining no it wasn't a blockbuster hollywood production but frankly i'm sick of that <UNK> i laughed more than a few times and had a good time it was definitely worth the rental the main character is a spoof on other hard british gangsters at least that's the way i saw it if you go in expecting a 100 million dollar production you'll be disappointed enjoy it for what it is a small entertaining film
<START> i'm not saying anything new when i say that ray was magnificent as i proceed to <UNK> this movie i have to mention something that sets it apart from other films very rarely is a film made entirely by the actor s ray quite simply was made by jamie foxx without the wonderful performance of jamie foxx ray would just be another interesting and informative biopic i always thought foxx was funny <UNK> from his days with in <UNK> color and the jamie foxx show and i also knew that he was talented as he used his own show the jamie foxx show to show off his musical talents but never did i imagine that he could pull off a role like this i don't know much about acting and what they go through to get into character or other things like that but what i saw from jamie foxx was extremely impressive he wrapped himself into that role and made us see ray charles rather than an actor portraying ray charles the story of ray was great yes but it was given life by jamie foxx
<START> i have seen this movie just once and i'm looking forward to see it again and again dear david from why did you bother to write a comment on this movie i only think we can think about you after reading you comment is that you're a non sexual person like erika in the movie and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up i guess you are a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your <UNK> the cannes film festival is by far the best movie festival and i'm is my pleasure to say that this film was awarded with best actress best actor and grand <UNK> isabelle <UNK> is magnificent as always who would do this movie like her one of her best performances ever the music is fantastic and once more michael <UNK> puts reality in the big screen it's like a kind of movie because of the topic try to see it br br
<START> in the dusty little town of <UNK> in texas an animal is <UNK> the cattle and the locals when the teenager tommy michael is killed their friends anna <UNK> erika fay her mexican american boyfriend <UNK> <UNK> gabriel jill sara and <UNK> <UNK> hughes finds that a mexican werewolf is the killer and they plot a plan to kill the beast br br mexican werewolf in texas is an amateurish crap and among the worse movies i have ever seen if not the worst nothing works in this movie the screenplay is laughable with some of the most terrible lines i have ever heard the direction does not exist and the camera follows the style of the blair witch project the amateurish acting seems to be a prank of high school students or a high school play the special effects are gruesome and extremely poor and the werewolf is the <UNK> i have ever seen ed wood movies are cult but this mexican werewolf in texas is pure garbage in the end jill says that no man can resist her actually the most beautiful thing in this flick but i believe the correct quote should be no man or woman can resist to watch this movie to the end i was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a movie can be and i lost <UNK> minutes of my life but i believe most of the viewers will stop seeing with less than 20 minutes running time my vote is one awful br br title brazil um no texas a mexican werewolf in texas
<START> warning <UNK> is a <UNK> and as such tends to be a bit overly dramatic so <UNK> about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the character's life but a dramatic <UNK> or so both agreed at the premiere in san francisco but <UNK> usual fascination with character dreams and <UNK> are well suited by this story first published in soldier of fortune and now a full length <UNK> book the soldier of fortune comment brought loud <UNK> from the politically correct sf audience and both <UNK> and main character had to ensure the audience who had just seen the film that interest was misplaced so warning this is not rambo just survival
<START> despite myself i really kinda like this movie <UNK> shore is <UNK> laugh out loud funny and here is no exception he is just excellent at playing the weirdo with a heart of gold br br his performance in this although nothing out of the ordinary for him is so good it seems to lift other cast <UNK> performances perhaps this is because he's the kind of guy it's easy to <UNK> off of br br the clichés about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way <UNK> city boy crawl is so at odds with the way of life is funny too but it's not only he who's a fish out of water comedy also comes from the fact that to any ordinary person or people crawl is a <UNK> nightmare of a person that's why this movie works in such a great way we love crawl he's a breath of fresh air but we can also <UNK> with the <UNK> he is one hell of a culture shock br br although this movie is classic <UNK> shore so there's no great brain power needed to enjoy the movie enjoy it you do and there's even a never judge a book by it's cover type moral here somewhere not bad not bad at all
<START> rendered in beautiful water colors at the cliff is definitely a sight to behold vaguely remembering the trailer witch i didn't find that impressive i was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was this film just washed over me with its <UNK> br br at the center is a young boy that comes into contact with a sea creature and its their relationship that carries the movie miyazaki is a master both at creating memorable imagery and showing young ones <UNK> in a believable way with their little quirks intact br br there are a few parts that didn't sit well with me it would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene <UNK> ride of the its a shame because such a precious film as this cant afford to take liberties and it hurt a otherwise truly great scene the antagonist and its back story never interested me either but i guess it served more as a background then anything else br br anyway great film the boat trip scenario with all its imagery and sea creatures stood out me thinks pure and magical and yes artwork is more intimate then computer animated i'm really <UNK> for <UNK> and the frog now
<START> on <UNK> <UNK> first trip to hollywood he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed it's not half as good any of those films br br in fact <UNK> is second billed to dorothy as a spoiled <UNK> who finds out she's been living her <UNK> lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial <UNK> hale hamilton it comes as quite a shock to she considers a show business career as a way for an <UNK> br br bogart is a test pilot who is also an <UNK> engineer and he's <UNK> an ultimate airplane <UNK> and is looking for <UNK> is willing to do it besides she likes what she sees in <UNK> br br considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a <UNK> it's a bit <UNK> to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair the part doesn't wear well on him br br love affair is your average b program second feature nothing terribly special about it
<START> the dvd <UNK> explains the premise three problem teens are headed for jail and are set to do time until captain <UNK> offers them a deal to work for him undercover the film opens with <UNK> of the words <UNK> and squad so you won't have to look them up in the <UNK> for a visual definition of cool search for photographs of the original <UNK> michael cole as pete <UNK> clarence williams iii as hayes and peggy <UNK> as julie barnes br br one black one white one blonde once they defined cool br br the three who make up scott <UNK> version of aaron <UNK> the <UNK> squad are claire danes as julie barnes <UNK> <UNK> as pete <UNK> and omar <UNK> as hayes they aren't able to do much with the material given mr <UNK> portrayal is the most far out meaning he most from the original characterization ms danes romances josh <UNK> as billy <UNK> who looks like he could be in a re make of marcus <UNK> you won't believe <UNK> michael <UNK> dancing with mr he explains i'm not a fairy i just like to dance and <UNK> spin me br br the <UNK> squad 1999 scott silver claire danes <UNK> <UNK> omar <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is like a long cool drink of water after <UNK> across the <UNK> to classic film buffs who have been too long <UNK> of that certain cinematic magic not only is it beautifully photographed but the characters are perfectly portrayed if you're looking for the film to be a mirror of the book you will be seriously disappointed instead it is an excellent companion to the book and i think that is what anthony intended ralph <UNK> is probably the most beautiful man in the world not to mention a brilliant actor juliette <UNK> is the <UNK> for vulnerability and <UNK> enthusiasm and of course i'll go see any film in which <UNK> scott thomas is featured she simply must be the best actress since the likes of deborah kerr so much was promised with this film and so much is delivered
<START> when does the hurting stop that's what i said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the movie that really sucked this film nearly <UNK> all the life out of me and i have sat through some really bad movies coming from a true puppet master fan i would expect to hear myself say this but it's true the plot is inane the special effects awful the sound track the most <UNK> i have ever heard oh i almost forgot about the acting it was so bad that i forgot it was there at all <UNK> said the only redeeming factor in the film is the puppets themselves they truly are the stars and could out act all but guy <UNK> himself he is the <UNK> and although you can see their <UNK> and strings they carry me throughout the painful start to finish of retro puppet master in closing is for true fanatics who happen to be <UNK> br br roach br br
<START> i absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained the directing acting and the story is brilliant definitely up there with films like scarface and the godfather this movie makes your heart race <UNK> as well as all of the cast was amazing i would definitely rent this movie <UNK> deserves an academy award for his acting and for the way he portrayed the life of a gangster this movie is a soon to be classic and an all around brilliant piece of film making i loved it and i give it 10 stars in a sentence the only way to describe it is a film without any flaws watch this movie and you'll see what i mean 2 thumbs up
<START> for their credit this is one of their more competent pieces of trash and that's because there's considerably good gore and an interesting take on ripping off snakes on a plane but if there's any more of example of the <UNK> behind <UNK> rip off it's the two characters at the beginning whom are illegal immigrants and can't understand nor speak english to a texas man <UNK> them across the border yet when they get on a train and meet a friend they begin understanding and speaking perfect english br br aside from being a pretty bad depiction of a hollywood formula snakes on a train is utterly boring at least with snakes on a plane we were given the chance to watch actors wax comedic and attempt to be remotely interesting the brothers installment features some of the most boring characters i've ever seen from an <UNK> engineer gee i wonder how he comes in handy later on to some <UNK> surfers right down to our two main characters attempting to fight off the snake curse that <UNK> in the husband's wife br br snakes is never entertaining and even when it's very gory it's still never as good as it has the chance to be because snakes could have been a funny short film and instead just takes itself much too seriously and never camps it up at any moment instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a <UNK> they instead force their small budget to work against them in these knock offs while the brothers seem to be trying the train just looks incredibly artificial br br it seems almost like a stage play with these inconsistent and awfully bland set pieces that try desperately to look like actual train cars while every so often it shakes the background of the windows are <UNK> and the sound effects go off every now and then to let us know they're actually on a train not to mention that in such a large extended train there only seems to be about ten passengers on it and beyond the train fight and a drawn out sex scene we're forced to be subjected to a plot that makes zero sense and not even the directors can work around the fact that the lethal snakes that go on this train look far from <UNK> or dangerous br br the rest of the film <UNK> onto only about a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent trying to <UNK> a passenger all of this dull exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer generated snake i saw better animation on the super <UNK> completely <UNK> the train whole and is then <UNK> in a method that should have been <UNK> from the very beginning asylum scores again br br asylum scores yet again with a hackneyed lazy horribly directed and boring rip off of another better film snakes on a train takes itself way too seriously and that's why it's never entertaining or memorable
<START> yes it's pure trash it might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental cinema like me to see <UNK> <UNK> and doing nothing for almost two hours but it gets very painful when you realize you have actually paid for this probably this is one of those films you love to watch for its complete <UNK> and <UNK> i accept it though for its shock value decades before <UNK> and pulp fiction
<START> i have no respect for imdb ratings anymore i think a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> the website and voted for this this is not an artistic movie it is mormon propaganda nothing wrong with that but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading if you are a bible <UNK> christian or a mormon watch this movie you'll love it and think it is truly amazing for anyone else don't bother the story is so contrived random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way this guy tries to commit suicide cause he sleeps with his neighbor are you kidding what a <UNK> anyways this is an awful movie
<START> the man <UNK> <UNK> and the young girl go through the film consumed by passion for each other they long to be together but their moments together are constantly interrupted the film is <UNK> together with imagery and comes to a halt after an hour do the lovers find happiness br br the film starts interestingly with footage of <UNK> but you soon realize that its all a pretentious piece of nonsense it's made as a silent film with occasional dialogue and it has a non stop soundtrack playing that at one point is so irritating that you will turn the sound down and want to watch it as a silent film the continuous drum rolls must have driven cinema audiences mad there are some genuinely funny moments <UNK> when the man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man unfortunately this humour is carried out in the name of art so its just pseudo nonsense the film is crap
<START> this was a character's movie the plot wasn't that hot when it was there but the characters were interesting and very well acted the story focuses on the travis family in the wake of the <UNK> son's suicide i say that loosely because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother because if the father was supposed to have the story focus on him too they edited the movie pretty poorly the acting on all parts was very good particularly <UNK> <UNK> as the surviving confused son the characters were all very interesting and i didn't mind watching them until late in the film when it just seemed to drag br br my big complaint however was the story the son killing himself was supposed to be the center of the plot however it really wasn't it was something that happened at the start of the story but then everything went every which way then they'd mention that the son killed himself to remind you that that was the central thread the other thing was that the big plot twists of which there were plenty were never really explained or built up to but just thrown in there randomly and often from far left field in fairness the ending was very very cool but it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from about half of it the half that wasn't padding was pretty much lifted from the story in the pearl jam song alive which reminds me br br there was a poem in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed <UNK> i could not have been the only one who recognized that said poem was lifted word for word from that very same song i <UNK> this was a movie i had hope for and they really really dropped the ball
<START> this is an ok early 80's horror flick in which a young girl meg <UNK> is wanting to shed her <UNK> two shoes image and becomes part of a girl gang called the sisters their <UNK> for her consists of spending the night in a <UNK> too bad the <UNK> is the final <UNK> place of some psycho russian psychic and he's not quite dead yet seems this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck into the walls from his <UNK> target practice plus there is a pile of young dead girls found in the closet all proof that <UNK> <UNK> can be dangerous so listen up girls the daughter of this man is rather <UNK> about her father's death and is confronted by a man that said he knew and given a tape to listen too her <UNK> adam west of batman fame is there to laugh and <UNK> and not much else but it seems that perhaps daughter may also have some abilities that she doesn't realize anyway having <UNK> their unfortunate <UNK> at the <UNK> the rest of the sisters take off to go get stuff like masks sheets etc to come back and scare the crap out of her but little do they suspect what's going on and they get more than the crap scared out of them for even in death is kind of a busy guy and he's <UNK> lots of corpses for entertainment and it would also seem that he has a thing for jail bait overall this is acceptable horror nothing too intense but not terrible either the dvd from media <UNK> also contains another version of the movie that's a rough cut i guess i only watched a little of it so i don't know how different it is from the theatrical release but from what i saw i guess it's a <UNK> and all presentation 7 out of 10
<START> i really didn't see this one coming roy had me <UNK> out i am the perfect sucker for a static camera long live king <UNK> and i was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film he hit me straight between the eyes you have to be a brilliant man to make self pity hilarious reminds me of the third mate on the <UNK> in <UNK> dick <UNK> a man who took the whole of life to be a practical joke that the good lord himself is playing on us and the web of <UNK> in this movie is truly hilarious br br the level of satire is at fever pitch you have one <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignore a spiritual self reflection crying out in agony the very depths of <UNK> are <UNK> i really never thought it possible to go further than <UNK> the silence in this respect however the of the self love and self regard by every single character in this film is <UNK> we are shown an existence where the talentless and the <UNK> <UNK> against a world they believe has been <UNK> towards them they truly are legends in their own living rooms the human beings in this film make self deception and self <UNK> a great br br only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on an old woman who refuses to leave a <UNK> down praying for the forgiveness of all mankind her speech is the most <UNK> <UNK> of the modern world i have ever heard she reveals through her <UNK> that what is wrong with the world is not to be fixed by mere <UNK> there are not a just a few faults there is an <UNK> of corruption that can only be <UNK> by and judgement day watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk stood <UNK> deep in a cold river at midnight screaming out a thousand for the sins of humanity another grand is that it is clear that her <UNK> are <UNK> and in fact she is stopping everyone going home at closing time br br this is not a film for the smug no one is <UNK> no <UNK> are left on the <UNK> no one group of humans is <UNK> to the glory of another group never has there been a greater more <UNK> more astonishingly beautiful <UNK> of our sins it is a film for the end of the world it is the grand <UNK> the great hideous practical joke of human life br br from the <UNK> of images it is too difficult to pick a favourite i slapped my <UNK> and almost fell off my chair in the cinema screaming with laughter as a man attempted to pull the <UNK> from under a set service i won't spoil what happens but the suspense builds up and something truly unexpected occurs it is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen in a cinema i am quite reserved and i just couldn't control myself that is the measure of the greatness of this film br br the shooting of you the living is <UNK> <UNK> we are shown the palette of an artist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and sky blues set alive by the shock of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is never a tone out of place it's like an hour and a half of <UNK> colour <UNK> the obsession that must have gone into putting that colour scheme in place is extraordinary and no shot is wasted as with all great movies there is not a spare inch of celluloid br br perhaps the best film i've ever seen
<START> this is a very good movie i give it a 10 br br it's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way br br she sees a murder for a snuff movie and decides to run but is chased this takes quite some time i won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience but rest assured it's very believable well played very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending br br don't miss this movie
<START> is the cannes controversy <UNK> remarkably <UNK> or is that we americans are so <UNK> and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore be that as it may with plenty of careful <UNK> at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to cannes in 2005 a <UNK> drab and <UNK> movie that rather lives up to it's <UNK> american re title low profile br br building on familiar themes of <UNK> angst and subsequent sexual <UNK> kind of admittedly it's a film not without it's surface level interests it starts out with a <UNK> as a haunting shot of a desolate off the highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter who ultimately walks by a car where supposedly a brutal hit and run has left the driver dead in a gory mess stunned he does nothing but pick up a <UNK> of the remaining engine br br just out of school the drifter turns out to be <UNK> a product of the german <UNK> with minimal ambition <UNK> by his caring but somewhat <UNK> parents to find a good job he <UNK> interview after interview with every <UNK> <UNK> along with it every one with the same <UNK> outcome getting mighty sick of it his aforementioned highway encounter soon <UNK> his first act of rebellion claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit br br pretending to fill out more <UNK> and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise he <UNK> in <UNK> sexual fantasies and petty <UNK> way after <UNK> as the days get shorter and the nights get much <UNK> as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he's doing nothing out of the ordinary br br if you seem confused about what exactly is going on don't worry about being the only one this is about as far and coherent as the story gets the plot seems simple enough and perhaps due to it's seemingly direct purposes that's why becomes <UNK> convoluted becoming <UNK> with endless false conclusions <UNK> situations and graphic sex scenes to try and <UNK> a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument supposedly the soul numbing effects of the modern suburban <UNK> or something about <UNK> fascination with crime hey it could even be a coming out movie at hand it spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols both <UNK> and <UNK> but they don't seem to be really <UNK> anything of interest br br the most fatal flaw however is how the filmmakers paint all it's characters in a rough <UNK> of vanilla there's hardly any <UNK> traits to help understand their purpose and how the secondary characters especially the confused relationship between <UNK> and his rather normal perhaps too normal family the already under developed lead character's plight never comes into focus how are we supposed to identify with this young almost rebellion with little sense of the world he's living in or the prominent figures around him that help <UNK> it br br many people drop in and out of the movie including sort of girlfriend <UNK> and a strange <UNK> visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever they ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next br br and even a movie that supposedly toys with reality especially with <UNK> exploits it ends with a literal almost <UNK> head <UNK> that seems to halt questions to a story that does little but put it's viewer in a state of <UNK> exhausted br br without any color it's impossible to <UNK> anything vital in
<START> excellent special effects make this disaster move very plausible one can see that the producers went to some trouble to get the displays on the computer screens just right it all makes it very convincing the sets are also very authentic looking a good choice of music rounds off the film nicely br br acting is good and the presence of david <UNK> adds some weight to the cast of course compared to other movies of this genre <UNK> is right up there with the best of them thankfully the human drama aspect has not been overdone as is often the case with this type of movie the human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the actual <UNK> scenes br br and of course the movie <UNK> what many of us suspect anyway weather so often do not get it right
<START> army private gene kelly who's also a talented <UNK> comes under fire for doing daring stunts without a net and <UNK> his high wire <UNK> meanwhile there's an elaborate <UNK> <UNK> to put on for army soldiers and <UNK> and the whole studio of m g m has shown up to join in the fun mickey rooney plays m c introducing acts like kay <UNK> and his orchestra bob crosby benny carter and the m g m dancing girls who appear to be dressed as <UNK> red <UNK> does a cute bit with donna reed and margaret o'brien but the other comedic bits suffer from an apparent <UNK> between the performers and the allegedly live audience they're awfully silent until the editor cuts to them for exaggerated reaction shots judy garland sings an inappropriate song about a <UNK> night at <UNK> hall <UNK> accompanied by classical <UNK> <UNK> iturbi whom judy calls the production is glossy but the manic energy feels false <UNK> from
<START> when i know that walter will never grace another set i was in my 30's when i first saw this sweet endearing and <UNK> romantic film i loved it from the first scene and all the way through to the end art <UNK> was his usual <UNK> self glenda matched walter step for step in the <UNK> and richard benjamin <UNK> the sarcastic voice of reason that he does so well along the way there were many actors whom we all recognize doing their usual brilliance there are a couple of lines in the movie which my so and i have used throughout the years but i won't say anything about them here i'm pretty sure you will know which two i am talking about just get this movie make some popcorn grab your squeeze if he is as sappy as mine is for which i am thankful and enjoy this standout romantic comedy from the 70's you will not be disappointed however i have the feeling that i am preaching to the choir here because anyone who loves walter will already own it i'm very glad it's out on dvd now finally
<START> 'the big came into my life complete by accident and has left an <UNK> mark on my soul a <UNK> of love destruction and <UNK> that will forever be a part of my life this is tale of beautiful <UNK> we are helpless without each other we are helpless against <UNK> wrong <UNK> we are helpless as to the choices we all try to make when in love deaf to the <UNK> and goings on of an world outside the window blind to an inevitable apocalypse dumb of the hatred and greedy opinions of an over indulgent society this is a tale of personal commitment and <UNK> love <UNK> the <UNK> of war their petty <UNK> is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with it's pains and darkness everyone has some irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way we travel only a short distance with the two main characters but are left wanting to complete our own <UNK> with a some of their simple loving honest philosophy in <UNK> i am so very glad that i exist in this <UNK> <UNK> another 20 years either side of my birth date and i would not have seen and felt the big <UNK> william white <UNK>
<START> of the two slaughter movies this is the better and even though its hardly a <UNK> list in complexity it is bloody funny all the men are the <UNK> or the baddies and the women are all just and emotionally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> girl it is also bloody funny and the pro has got to be the funniest movie <UNK> of all time you just can't get enough of those hats purple suits gold chains and <UNK> <UNK> forever the best bit is where he has the <UNK> around him going do you <UNK> everything about him is larger than life and it is of morris day in purple rain jim brown also proves hes a private dick for all the chicks and again he kicks <UNK> ass in every direction the car scene is very unrealistic that they survive it <UNK> but hey this is the movies definitely the finest flick and it surpasses <UNK> 1971 even the first movie is pretty good
<START> i love lucy but this movie is so <UNK> bad that i was <UNK> in embarrassment for all concerned within the first ten minutes and it just got worse from there lucille <UNK> singing is downright painful and the attempts to make her appear more youthful through the use of soft focus had me reaching for my reading glasses it's bombs like this that give bombs a bad name
<START> this is a movie from toilet pictures if the name of the production company is any indication how <UNK> a movie is then this would be it i think i'm not really a fan of horror movies not that i'm chicken but rather this year alone i haven't been genuinely <UNK> by what's on offer so far be it from the west or from asia 9 <UNK> is no different great premise but poor execution relying on clichéd techniques i think these are the only tools of the trade available to try and <UNK> some heart <UNK> moments br br se <UNK> <UNK> so young is a lonely career woman who one day notices that some apartments in the block of <UNK> opposite hers <UNK> <UNK> simultaneously at precisely 9 everyday no she's no <UNK> but a series of unexplained deaths in the <UNK> including one which she encounters herself on a subway start to draw her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deaths br br with horror movies there's always a pseudo logical explanation within the movie about how the <UNK> come about that's just about the most interesting thing that happens in the film the of the truth although it won't take seasoned film lovers to guess the plot halfway through which of course makes it a very unsatisfying experience watching this movie br br there's a <UNK> of characters like the wheelchair bound girl and the <UNK> who take turns to care for her as well as a <UNK> detective a mentally challenged boy and a spooky train <UNK> but following genre formula these folks are there usually as fodder for deaths or in this case pointless red <UNK> characters whose sole aim by the filmmakers is to <UNK> the audience <UNK> if they <UNK> or add little to forward the plot br br and don't get me started on the techniques employed here quick cuts sudden appearances long hair <UNK> so <UNK> who can't move properly <UNK> amount of blood like it flows down a mountain for free and the list goes on but credit to the sound <UNK> for creating some ear <UNK> bone <UNK> sounds used each time the <UNK> move though it seems like a one trick <UNK> br br don't waste time on this even if you're a horror fan it's a complete waste of a promising premise and in the end you feel like you've just be taken on a ride a very long and painful one to endure it's high time for some <UNK> in this genre otherwise one film will easily look like another with ugly long haired monsters moving funny but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds oh and can someone oil those doors while they're at it as well
<START> when voting i was going to give a 2 but when seeing that 1 meant awful it hit the nail on the head the portrayal of native americans as blood <UNK> <UNK> is deeply disturbing to me this is the third film i've seen of d w <UNK> where races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways the man isn't able to tell his side of the story so i'm going to try and keep away from attacking mr griffith personally in my opinion the three films probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and their children's children films like this probably made for many of the <UNK> that are still with us some may say the camera work was great the action a first for it's time the <UNK> are far <UNK> by the <UNK> it's like someone taking 10 from you and giving a dime back to make up for it
<START> this film has to rank down there with ed wood films a terrible script and bad bad acting br br a machine gun fight in front of plate glass windows minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody has cover not one window ever breaks you'd think after a fire fight like that the big u <UNK> truck might be <UNK> not a scratch br br do cia agents and government <UNK> shout top secret information at a stand up cocktail party with hundreds of people around br br there isn't one actor you care about everyone is shallow and basically unlikable br br a hawaii bound <UNK> flies out of los angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the pacific in 100 feet of water a short time passes when the <UNK> <UNK> to the five other passengers they only have two hours of air left on a <UNK> br br the next day the rescue teams show up and amazingly the six passengers are still alive br br a movie that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worse br br
<START> wealthy businessman bill <UNK> played by dennis patrick accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument panic stricken he <UNK> to a bar and meets joe played by peter boyle a loud mouth angry <UNK> who is bitter over how his beloved country has become unintentionally bill allows joe to find out that he just killed a hippie and this is only the beginning joe is a classic film of an unlikely friendship a bond between two men one of a white collar background the other of a blue collar background bill joe have one thing in common they are <UNK> over how crazy the world has become dennis patrick peter boyle have both given very realistic portrayals of their characters director john g with this pre rocky effort directs this low budget gem with the same <UNK> as a movie with a 100 million budget the script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy realistic dialog in spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses the script falls asleep roughly 3 4 of the way through but it wakes up just in time for the jarring climax this film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24 year old susan sarandon as <UNK> daughter melissa along with her hippie boyfriend frank portrayed very <UNK> by patrick <UNK> <UNK> one could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film in spite of its few flaws this is one of those forgotten films of the 70's that should not be even though joe is very dated to today's standards the chemistry between dennis patrick peter boyle is completely relevant today and it is the <UNK> that holds the whole film together
<START> just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example he's reached the point where you realize that his <UNK> hasn't changed since his snl days over ten years ago he's doing the same <UNK> stream of consciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard he's some weird type a comedian not the cool cat he's supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cut outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than <UNK> an entire neighborhood and main street alec <UNK> tries to do a funny great <UNK> impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent there's even an <UNK> <UNK> moment with faux celebrity paris hilton that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks it's not even an interesting train wreck i hope they'll make <UNK> hears a who with robin williams then we'll have the bad seuss movie starring <UNK> comedian trilogy
<START> a child like <UNK> for a public access children's show goes over the deep end when he discovers kids he entertains at a hospital were victims of horrible abuse this movie has some of the worst <UNK> monstrous parents you could ever come across not an exploitation film as much as an <UNK> special on the dangers of child abuse seemingly harmless mr takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are <UNK> by lack of evidence to convict <UNK> parents of their terrible abuse towards their children the children are <UNK> and zombie like due to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them the parents loud <UNK> harsh <UNK> and <UNK> the mothers in particular are so obscene you'll root for their execution they are essentially miserable people taking out their <UNK> on the kids our detectives are a tired lot frustrated with the whole <UNK> process how police <UNK> is often unable to <UNK> those who beat their kids into <UNK> while the crimes themselves are <UNK> the film doesn't <UNK> elaborate the grisly activity on screen i'd say the reason to see this is for tom performance as the <UNK> man child who slips into <UNK> there's quite a weird dinner table sequence between mr and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an <UNK> mark notice the changes in behavior pretty impressive work going from innocent to creepy peter is lt hayes the detective in charge of the <UNK> cases expressing on his face the strain that is taking it's <UNK> on him there's an early performance by john <UNK> as detective <UNK> always raising the <UNK> of hayes because of his inability to follow directions not to mention how <UNK> he is regarding the parents <UNK> their kids awkward laid back <UNK> score that seems <UNK> for a film such as this controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much a bit too slow moving for my tastes but there's an effective use i felt of eyes before he takes care of business waiting <UNK> as he <UNK> to strike
<START> i loved that the mood was light and <UNK> i loved that the lead character wanted <UNK> about his future and that his roommate sets him straight of all people i loved that they <UNK> the dynamics of how the members in the men's group dealt with each other considering this was directed by a lesbian the whole theme of <UNK> was put out there <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> what makes a man what makes one straight gay or <UNK> you aren't really sure if our lead character has decided on who he really wants he's living in the moment and thrown caution to the wind these and other reasons make me love this film
<START> a professional production with quality actors that simply never touched the heart or the funny bone no matter how hard it tried the quality cast stark setting and excellent made you hope for <UNK> or high <UNK> drifter but sorry the soup had no <UNK> or meat for that matter a 3 of 10 for effort
<START> i m in two minds about following the film debut of christopher nolan part of me <UNK> it for <UNK> 6 000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house in many ways it reminds me of the cult movie <UNK> a film i disliked and i can t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around <UNK> t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write br br oh well i guess following gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie <UNK> 6 000 over two thousand imdb members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it <UNK> t made by the director of <UNK>
<START> one your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colours these do nothing for the story but they will keep your lazy eyes occupied for some 50 minutes a good example is the eternal use of a computer screen that shows each <UNK> from the <UNK> as that print is compared with the one they want to find out about yeah right br br two these guys being like real professional pros they will engage each other in intriguing pro talk look <UNK> these are what we call <UNK> everybody has them and they are different on each person so with these <UNK> we can actually find br br <UNK> exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there wasn't a completely <UNK> and stupid audience around br br however not everything about this show is bad some stories work to some degree and the colours are really beautiful they use red blue green yellow all of them colours i've loved since <UNK>
<START> a <UNK> sentimental tale from the author of the <UNK> were someone to pitch the material to me i would probably reject it as too <UNK> but the <UNK> here manages a tear without the expected embarrassment no one in the 1950's was better at lovable <UNK> than arthur <UNK> his appeal here is put to <UNK> use as a mountain man <UNK> faithful to a loyal hunting <UNK> their <UNK> are tied together as as any human bond good i see a subtle <UNK> message here all <UNK> go to heaven because how can we <UNK> any poor devil that merely follows instinct in order to stay alive there is no <UNK> in the kingdom of animals and yet how <UNK> we often treat them an oddly satisfying episode that <UNK> this important message
<START> any horror film that casts robert englund <UNK> <UNK> then kills him in the opening 5 minutes before the opening credits have even run should be instantly viewed with nothing but suspicion br br tony todd <UNK> as a swamp tour guide his james earl jones voice impression is hysterical by the way i don't know or care if he was trying to be funny but i was laughing at it sadly his role was all of 5 minutes long as well more reasons for suspicion and quite rightly so br br <UNK> <UNK> aka harmony from buffy angel i had to look her up to see what i remembered her from but she gets semi naked marcus the token black guy not another teen movie is filling a comedy role that really isn't required in a horror movie unless it's intended as a spoof br br joel murray bill <UNK> brother pete from <UNK> greg plays <UNK> the guy shooting the <UNK> video with the 2 cute girls as they take a spooky <UNK> ghost tour the 2 lead male characters meet up with some other folks and get run on rocks and have to leave the boat so their now all isolated in the swamp at night in the rain br br once the real story of victor <UNK> has been told his make up looked like <UNK> from the <UNK> we have established he is dead well you aren't coming back from being hit in the skull by an axe once the old guy is attacked despite pulling her gun and having a very clear shot it takes <UNK> more than 30 seconds to actually start firing at a guy who is <UNK> an old man apart with a <UNK> is she stupid thats <UNK> second too long in terms of plot there really isn't one i don't class undead psycho as a plot sorry and the pacing is really bad as well you have a killing some running away some light relief then some slow dialogue before beginning the cycle again br br after an extremely long scene investigating a <UNK> bush with a <UNK> in it victor appears again with some sort of power tool and kills the dark haired porno girl he also manages to slice the tour guide in half with a <UNK> once misty is left on her own to keep <UNK> for ben i felt it was pretty obvious she was going to be the next to die i was right but you don't get to see it br br film makers rain will not burning <UNK> ok idiots obviously after the 2 near misses in the cemetery marcus was next to die and ben was hurt in the foot with the spike but they managed to find a boat after <UNK> victor on the spike br br she's pulled into the water by something unseen he's trying to save her then she's suddenly pulled into the boat by victor and is screaming and the movie abruptly ends br br yeah just like that no clue if ben was dead he seemed to be missing an arm and no clue if <UNK> was going to survive and what happened with victor br br it's an awful ending and no doubt my verbal attack at the film makers got the last review deleted so much for free speech eh
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is truly as bad as it gets its cast of <UNK> <UNK> ruthless <UNK> shallow characters are intended as a reflection on its post eighties setting and i have to admit in this regard it is an accurate creation unfortunately it leaves me nothing to <UNK> with or care about and i regard it as just another step toward the television <UNK> rate phone in <UNK> astonishingly bad cheap reality and <UNK> <UNK> television and other cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and indeed much of british society sounds exaggerated i don't think it is in this regard programs such as <UNK> <UNK> have indeed been as influential as they are often called
<START> there are shows and films i've seen and subsequently read reviews of on imdb com that i've <UNK> with and been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinion br br reading positive reviews of this filth merely puts me in mind of a sinister conspiracy involving tv network employees being ordered to <UNK> the internet <UNK> <UNK> positive reviews for <UNK> they themselves are responsible for br br how else would one explain a review that this show is sure to become a phenomenon a full year after it's become clear its going to be nothing of the sort br br i won't waste words describing this mess but suffice to say if you enjoy wives who <UNK> their husbands husbands who <UNK> their sons children who are <UNK> <UNK> towards their parents and absolutely no other threads of behaviour or subtext to characters that are basically just unfunny one liner <UNK> <UNK> then watch this show br br i on the other hand have some seinfeld dvds to get through br br <UNK> cancelled <UNK> cancelled arrested development cancelled the war at home <UNK> br br no justice
<START> maybe my rating should have been a 9 but the film absolutely stunned me when viewing it first time and my latest viewing confirmed my initial belief stylish yes every scene has crafted <UNK> views terrific angles with a perfect sound side accompanying them br br put on top great acting from especially toni garner it with one of the most beautiful and charming women in olivia <UNK> and a fine plot and you will end up seeing this small masterpiece over and over br br <UNK> next movie de which is in competition in this years cannes festival will be eagerly <UNK>
<START> i first saw this as a kid the little <UNK> first went on tv the year i was born and fairly recently bought this on dvd in between i watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1 the pie fight itself and 2 how racist some of these parts were <UNK> as a slave doing voodoo for example i think roach and would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now br br notice how the pie fights in the three <UNK> holiday and in the sweet pie and pie resemble this one and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with harry <UNK> at columbia pictures there was obviously some inspiration from ss and laurel <UNK> the battle of the century for these films remember at that time they all stole from the best each other br br one more note laurel hardy buffs that <UNK> sale lady was none other than dorothy coburn who also appeared in the getting into her car and getting it in the rear end it always escapes me why she was never credited
<START> i love b movies but i like to be aware from the beginning that i'm watching one i can't believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and <UNK> so bad br br aliens and predator are awesome this movie made a big joke out of them the creators didn't take this movie seriously at all i am <UNK> disappointed in how the <UNK> <UNK> handled this film they made a mockery of amazing characters it's like they were trying to be serious in the beginning then their writers got high and gave up almost nothing was continuous the main characters were awful and were not aliens or <UNK> i am so ridiculously sad that no one takes alien and <UNK> seriously anymore these characters are icons of american pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films they should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves
<START> conrad phillips stars in the 1950s action adventure series william tell set in the century during the hostile <UNK> <UNK> of switzerland william tell is a reluctant freedom fighter battling <UNK> against the <UNK> and <UNK> of the <UNK> forces william tell is the swiss version of robin hood conrad phillips plays the protagonist fantastically it is possible that <UNK> would have had greater success in the role but he was <UNK> at the time of filming the classic action show is made up of series of <UNK> the episodes are in black and white but this does not detract from the entertainment in any way
<START> fbi agents <UNK> and <UNK> get assigned to <UNK> the mystery of what happened to an <UNK> <UNK> team in this early <UNK> <UNK> episode that david duchovny himself considers one of their first <UNK> episodes it pays loving homage to the much <UNK> john carpenter 1982 theatrical feature the thing and one can see the similarities visually color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a <UNK> quality production design art direction are especially impressive the shots of the exterior of the <UNK> camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of <UNK> <UNK> for some viewers naturally our heroes are threatened by the weather so the sound design involving wind evokes memories of the thing br br the <UNK> is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team once inside a host it <UNK> aggressive behavior this allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold and the way the script is set up we can't be too sure of who's infected and who's not this gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing this episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause <UNK> in groups it even allows <UNK> and <UNK> to have moments where they're not sure if they can trust each other br br guest starring are a good small group of actors <UNK> berkeley <UNK> <UNK> and steve <UNK> as the scientists <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> on the mission and jeff <UNK> as the pilot who takes them to the camp you can also see one time jason <UNK> <UNK> ken as one of the ill <UNK> original team members br br incidentally there's one direct link between and the thing art director murray who worked on both projects br br 8 10
<START> initially i was put off renting this movie due to the jacket art for the dvd in fact this held true with friends of mine who didn't rent it due to the art and the mental image s it <UNK> of being a movie that held little or no interest to me or to my friends but i rented and watched it and was truly amazed br br i agree with another <UNK> comments that this movie is not for everyone due to the blatant sexual so it is definitely not something i'd want young children to watch and doubt seriously if they would understand it anyway br br i enjoy movies like this <UNK> the character's personalities and who they are are genuinely defined in a no nonsense direct way with no <UNK> to indicate they will turn out bad the acting done was it acting <UNK> and jackson performed so well i was drawn into this movie not even realizing they were acting same thing with the story may seem far fetched somewhat but it was done so very very well it reminded me of another movie with mel gibson tim where each character had limitations whether mental or <UNK> so were well defined br br i found much depth in this movie with the character's involved so feel that everyone involved from the <UNK> to the actors should be <UNK> on a perfect fit result after viewing this movie i had talked to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it like i did so after hearing my comments they rented and watched it they too were quite surprised at how good it was it is too bad that the art on the jacket was done the way it was since it is a turn off i can see now how the art applies but i'd not heard of this movie before and the art was my first impression art sells or destroys dvd sales <UNK> br br these characters had more depth to them and good timing was <UNK> to give an audience like me time to <UNK> the feel for each i felt i could trust the movie to flow well and it did so with the jacket art aside i would recommend watching this movie
<START> this is my favorite <UNK> from the fifties it's the story of how <UNK> built and launched the <UNK> <UNK> nightclub we see the <UNK> <UNK> at the site to get construction <UNK> and the training of the dancers finally the <UNK> of opening night and the long sequence of <UNK> dancing financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described br br <UNK> is in great form as the easy going see him deal <UNK> with violent boyfriend <UNK> <UNK> is moving as the <UNK> prince who is <UNK> maria felix with that <UNK> body is <UNK> as the <UNK> lola first lover finally <UNK> as the <UNK> girl who ends up dancing for and becoming his girl is just stunning her <UNK> and <UNK> charm will win you over br br a bonus we get edith <UNK> <UNK> and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first off the alien saves a little black boy as well as a mexican despite what the imdb plot summary suggests this film is the <UNK> of the <UNK> of male <UNK> rape the main character in this film is a george <UNK> who doesn't understand primal human <UNK> like drug abuse and murder in fact every time he uses violence to solve a problem he has an internal conflict that physically <UNK> him what a square in any case my favorite scene is when he writes the gang members a letter stating if they want the 500 bucks they get from the reading center for protection they must meet with him at the meeting he is surrounded by countless gangsters but he keeps a cool head in slow motion he punches the wooden post of a stop sign that <UNK> upon contact then still in slow motion points at the leader of the gang and says <UNK> the gang members <UNK> cool right the beauty of this film shows through in these simple <UNK> to social problems like prostitution and gang violence
<START> forget all those sappy romantic movies involving <UNK> and lip locked couples who somehow manage to go to the great beyond together after a screen lifetime of over <UNK> unrealistic romance forget all those shameless dog gives its life to save its family flicks although i have to admit that i have a soft spot for them myself forget ricky <UNK> already displaying his <UNK> to <UNK> at a tender age now that one was shameless br br this tv movie which unfortunately never seems to get aired anymore is the all time champion of tear <UNK> hands down and a well written and well acted story to boot ann <UNK> took a big chance in taking this role nothing flamboyant or sexy about her here and that's a monumental achievement in itself based on a true story she plays <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> ill mother who chooses to struggle till her dying breath to find good homes for her ten children instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government <UNK> <UNK> forrest does a great job as her husband the good hearted but <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> <UNK> and personal demons make him unable to care for the kids br br the film takes us through heart wrenching process of <UNK> <UNK> parents and then watching her kids leave home it also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and of the father <UNK> over the tragedy taking place now and the one sure to follow and frustrated over his inability to do more the scene in which the youngest of the children steven is taken to his new home is the most heart breaking i've ever watched now i grew up as a hopeless romantic and have spent the many years since then growing myself a harder more cynical shell i usually find more to mock than to empathize with in the sentimental cinematic tripe <UNK> upon us these days but this gem from the early 1980's still <UNK> me br br i really wish that someone with a <UNK> of marketing sense would release a dvd version of this drama among the special features one needs to include the emmy awards <UNK> the following year a m was nominated for this role but the award for best dramatic actress went to barbara stanwyck for thorn birds in what has to be one of the greatest moments in what is now a truly drab awards show stanwyck broke into tears during her acceptance speech and <UNK> out ann <UNK> i love you which brought ann m to tears br br one final note the imdb rating for who will love my children is 6 4 as of this writing however over 75 of the ratings are in the 8 10 range mostly <UNK> whatever kind of system this site uses to <UNK> the overall ratings of the movies listed by imdb it completely misses the mark on this one this one is the <UNK> of all time and a darn good tv movie to boot
<START> here's a well made war story nicely shot and well acted the portraying of the italian and german <UNK> of greek island is well done john hurt as father and the island doctor is superb nicolas cage does a good job as the captain from the title penelope <UNK> does a good job of being beautiful and <UNK> her <UNK> at cage there's <UNK> and humor there's drama and romance and it is all set on an <UNK> island br br oddly enough a very similar or should i say almost identical storyline with the same characters going through the same series of events is told in a novel by the same title written by louis de this wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful daughter of doctor and their life on during wwii <UNK> local <UNK> <UNK> when the italian army <UNK> northern <UNK> from <UNK> under false <UNK> when the <UNK> finally <UNK> with a lot of help from the germans a <UNK> of italian soldiers is <UNK> on the island and captain plays a big part in keeping the <UNK> a peaceful time as joins the <UNK> charming and his <UNK> are <UNK> with the doctor and his beautiful daughter of course this makes it a novel about love but it is also a war novel a summary of greek history a tale of communist <UNK> in post war <UNK> a portrait of the madness of <UNK> and most importantly an <UNK> to island life on br br some of these elements return in the movie but in general it is an impossible book to film i am glad nobody ever tried br br the movie <UNK> however is worth seeing just make sure you read the book after you see the movie
<START> i love this movie it is the first film master p have ever done it is based on the story of his life it is low budget but it is very good it shows how master p grew up in projects in new orleans br br not only did master p start in this movie he also was the writer and director with moon jones the dvd also has the no limit ice cream party on it this movie shows how master p goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him it also has many of the no limit records <UNK> in this film you should buy or rent this film br br it is a great movie to watch is you like rap or is a master p fan i will not spoil this movie for you go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it you will like it
<START> darling <UNK> is fantastic its by far one my favorite films it certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received julie andrews playing the title role of <UNK> smith <UNK> is the best part of the whole movie she is <UNK> and spectacular as julie andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far i was most <UNK> not surprised by how stunning she is this movie is just great i'm running out of <UNK> it's magnificent marvellous amazing funny terribly romantic sad and just an all out thrill and its all thanks to dame julie andrews and to her husband director blake <UNK> oh yeah rock hudson was ok too br br julie andrews is the beautiful and well loved singer <UNK> smith rock hudson portrays major who quickly falls for <UNK> and she with him but their affair was not there meeting was planned by the german government i'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them but you get the point because the warm happy singing entertainer <UNK> is actually a german spy <UNK> is told to seduce major in order to get information of the new top secret later know as <UNK> <UNK> though <UNK> is on a <UNK> mission she falls in love with bill major for real making her original quest challenging but <UNK> pulls through and <UNK> er task after she finds out something that is not really true about bill the ending will remain <UNK> by me as it is wonderfully <UNK> out if anything you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie i most certainly did br br
<START> i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be fights or shooting cops robbers <UNK> or indians it was definitely not a cool film to like so i didn't see until i was in my <UNK> and found it one of the most beautiful captivating films i have seen all the actors deliver the <UNK> perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene the filming and direction are <UNK> simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story my two favourite scenes are birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end directed and edited to perfection the quality and <UNK> of jenny voice when she calls my daddy ' <UNK> emotion from the viewer tears are <UNK> in my eyes as i think of it br br this adaptation isn't just a movie it is a piece of precious art as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be <UNK> to of an emotional experience
<START> this without doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies i have ever seen i really enjoyed the characters in the movie they are all wonderful bizarre in them <UNK> it's quite something i have never seen before in any movie br br the story is almost non stop from beginning to the end there are no boring moments i was totally captured by the movie and i thought the acting was great br br so if you want to see a fun movie you should look for the green <UNK> a great movie br br i give it 10 10
<START> this is a family movie set in 1950's rural america about a boy whose uncle <UNK> sheep killing charges against his dog drum starting not only a family legal <UNK> but community <UNK> as their town begins to take sides br br this is formula film that attempts to be very touching and sweet its biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were scott <UNK> defense lawyer ron <UNK> father owner and the dog john and kathy <UNK> sissy from the original family affair as the uncle and his wife were okay the children were not that good basically they looked like they were acting and that's a problem when the film really revolves around them aaron who plays the bully <UNK> makes me think of what the actor russell <UNK> must have looked liked as a child only with no talent but a lot of ham br br favorite line spoken by the <UNK> after scott <UNK> defense closing trial speech we'll be lucky if they don't lynch us br br favorite line spoken by ron <UNK> after his son punches the bully now making him your friend that will be the hard part br br cute enough to rent buy used
<START> now this is classic a friend of mine told me about this flick saying that it's incredibly lame stupid retarded and moronic he also said that i'd love it br br to my surprise i found it available from netflix and rented it at once i'm just shocked that i had never heard of it before if i could give it an eleven i would br br
<START> this is the first recorded effort to put sound with a movie and a the oldest that obviously is still in existence this historic piece of film is the opening segment in the more <UNK> of the natural <UNK> dvd br br it's only a 15 second clip of a man playing a <UNK> in front of a huge recording <UNK> next to him are two men dancing near the end another man walks on the stage william <UNK> the director of this experiment is the <UNK> player this movie had several titles over the years but the sound experiment was not really a success it took over 30 years from this point to the <UNK> sight and sound to the point where something could be <UNK> to the public for entertainment however this was a start no matter how primitive it came off br br for more of the technical information and history of this film process see the other review here by <UNK>
<START> my first exposure to japanese animation director <UNK> miyazaki and his studio <UNK> production company was when an english dubbed version of spirited away was released about 7 years ago what a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was so on that note i managed to get my movie theatre employed friend to see this new film of miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things disney this movie's u s <UNK> once again all i can say is wow what awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the ocean and what about the title character's transformation from a <UNK> to and seeing how some characters' demeanor changes and well watch this movie if you want to know what i'm talking about oh and the voices being used for this american dubbed version tina <UNK> betty white liam neeson <UNK> <UNK> and lily <UNK> good choices all does everything make sense no but that's part of the <UNK> charm that <UNK> throughout there's plenty of funny scenes concerning and the boy and many other people they encounter oh i think i've written too much so i'll just highly recommend <UNK> miyazaki's
<START> i would have given this film a one star vote had it not been for the laughs i got out of it some of the dialogs were just plain so lame that they make you laugh how could some one have actually talked like this not to mention the fact that the bodyguard <UNK> antonio <UNK> jr flew a <UNK> like a pro and michael team of <UNK> were able to dig a <UNK> filled with <UNK> and blow up a huge <UNK> in the nick of time did anyone notice the lame tribute to fantasy island with the guy saying boss the plane to michael <UNK> just as the <UNK> comes in sight br br the only saving grace were the cute girls and even <UNK> female <UNK> not to mention that the main <UNK> deserved to die the lame death that he did for being such a joker imagine escaping from being tied up just to shot by a <UNK> hello br br the poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating <UNK> and having <UNK> just for laughs they should make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of a category 3 <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> did i hear michael <UNK> calling it the best honeymoon resort in the pacific now that would make an interesting movie
<START> wow this was a real stinker this early sci fi flick has nothing going for it than pure camp there's so much scientific <UNK> <UNK> in the dialog it's laughable the female character played by <UNK> is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film watch this one with your girlfriend i guarantee it will make her blood <UNK> the only good thing is the musical score which expertly build the <UNK> of the film the special effects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the movie with some good b stars in the lead roles the acting isn't too bad but the lines they are given must have given them quite a challenge the challenge of not laughing their heads off
<START> the elegant documentary br br don't watch this movie if you're an <UNK> know all student of physics this much less than one percent <UNK> <UNK> of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know br br do watch this movie if you're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99 of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including <UNK> quantum string and m theory br br what a brilliantly <UNK> documentary starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic and <UNK> beyond i have always had a huge appreciation of <UNK> this movie can easily give you an insight into what an <UNK> beautiful language <UNK> is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade br br the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini series split over three shows it therefore makes sense to give us polite little <UNK> of the principles being presented i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the <UNK> of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing <UNK> of our very existence br br we are all and everything around us is energy with a natural tendency towards harmony this movie may blow your mind or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us even with the <UNK> and far far smaller than the and within the <UNK> we learned about in high school m theory holds many magnificent of br br it just seemed so appropriate that all of this <UNK> should by it's very nature move by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting out of the realm of science and into the realm of br br you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god br br bravo brian greene well done indeed br br p s if you're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the quantum <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> of all things can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch what the <UNK> down the rabbit hole yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a <UNK> may not be able to see a boat if he hasn't seen one before my eyes process light <UNK> just fine i see things everyday that i've never seen before and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don't <UNK> but if you can get over these little <UNK> and put down the things you don't like and hang on to those that you do there is a lot to like about this film br br then watch the secret 2006 documentary about the law of attraction search for imdb title this information just might change your life profoundly forever if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought if you'll listen and some are and that is truly incredible there is a modern day jesus <UNK> <UNK> those among others that history suggests have <UNK> with the non physical alive today and she lives in texas i know some of you know what i'm talking about br br i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now
<START> i want to <UNK> this review by saying that i have no idea what <UNK> is truly about all i really know is that in the beginning god kills himself in turn <UNK> mother earth who proceeds to <UNK> herself with god's <UNK> she then <UNK> a son the rest is pretty <UNK> and you have to interpret it in your own way br br how i chose to interpret the film was this god killing himself <UNK> the start of the scientific revolution when people started questioning the <UNK> <UNK> by the church like the view of the universe and etc mother earth <UNK> people starting to think for themselves and reject the <UNK> it happens like this because god says so views the <UNK> people were the church <UNK> back at them trying to force christianity down their throats i'm not exactly sure how son of earth fits into all of this mother earth and the <UNK> people seemed to be fighting over him so maybe he represents the freedom of people or something to that effect br br i have no idea what the final parts of this movie are supposed to mean <UNK> <UNK> then <UNK> mother earth and son of earth and <UNK> them into the ground like a <UNK> and could mean anything but that is where the fun of this film lies you can interpret it any way you want there doesn't have to be a definitive meaning to it you can let your mind wander sometimes you don't even know what you are supposed to be looking at because it is shot in a weird angle or it is too fuzzy br br the only thing that disappointed me was that i was expecting a truly terrifying film i was going into it thinking i was going to get a phone call immediately afterward with a foreboding seven days warning what i got was pleasantly different it was not scary at all but it <UNK> my imagination trying to <UNK> the movie's <UNK> message was a creative challenge there were many scenes that were in fact beautiful mother earth just after she was born and the final shot of the forest path come to mind br br so overall i would have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this film it is certainly the most abstract movie i've ever seen but that's not a bad thing
<START> i won't be too hard on this show because i enjoyed the first season but then things got worse the concept is nothing special just about a girl named <UNK> who is trying to cope with a new step brother derek and his loud crude family while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them br br in season 1 the story was actually interesting i liked <UNK> back then because she was smart strong independent and conservative she was well mannered and deep i felt bad when she was being <UNK> at her new school by her new step brother she was a <UNK> but not as annoying as the later episodes oh and she dated a nice guy who is now currently portrayed as one of <UNK> idiot friends the season <UNK> the true tension the title of the show was trying to capture br br now i can't say the show has really gone downhill because the story is sometimes interesting but i root for derek now instead of <UNK> now there is little if any interaction between the two siblings if they interact it's only briefly oh and i don't want any fans in my face people that's called incest even if they are step siblings my tolerance can only go so far but that's not the point br br it's strange derek as the antagonist has gotten more sensitive over time while <UNK> the supposed protagonist is more neurotic and unlikeable than before i like how the younger kids get more <UNK> but the parents are even more clueless than before but that's not the biggest problem br br unfortunately we are forced to see everything from <UNK> point of view with lame nauseating background music she has gotten <UNK> and more shallow over time in one episode she got whiny and wanted her boyfriend to be more <UNK> so she <UNK> dumped food on herself and blamed derek now what happened to being a strong independent feminist i haven't watched much of the fourth season but i hear she is dating a guy named truman who is a jackass and is arrogant oh i remember that <UNK> episode she constantly reminds him she doesn't like him freaks out over being by a sword and in the end <UNK> up with him because she can handle him what the hell why go with a guy like that in the first place the 1st season <UNK> would have just <UNK> him in his never mind or maybe that would have been my reaction oh and she's a <UNK> not that that's a bad thing but i think she fell on her head at one of her practices and in a prom episode she cried because she couldn't find the dress in her dreams and wasn't completely satisfied until she became prom queen one thing i've noticed is that no matter how bad <UNK> tries to tell us her life is <UNK> almost always go her way in the end she gets the guy she wants derek gets some kind of revenge people all love her etc derek is still quite immature but i see that he really has <UNK> i don't see why many people hate sally she seems nice and it's good to see derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about rather than playing the field he is also treating <UNK> slightly better and is a good brother to <UNK> br br really the show is so so and i rated it low because despite some character development the character i once admired has now become like any <UNK> teen queen you can see anywhere on tv but it was good while it lasted
<START> although i could sum this pathetic episode of night gallery in two words those two words being horse <UNK> i am <UNK> to write a minimum of ten lines this is a very <UNK> episode not worthy of the standards of rod <UNK> but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy the premise of giant <UNK> <UNK> the moon a lifeless <UNK> to be sure is totally ridiculous as is the construction of a giant <UNK> i suppose we are to also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive i can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to <UNK> the other two episodes first aired on that date all in all a waste of film actors and air time
<START> this is one of the worst movies ever there is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added <UNK> the shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing antonio <UNK> is horrible i mean even worse than normal how does this guy work the directing is the worst and there is nothing <UNK> in the entire films i love shark movies and this one just disappoints i've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work i'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story
<START> the sound in this movie is a nightmare that is the best i can say for this movie any chance of a good story is lost once this films starts the premise of the film sounds good a playboy who comes to terms with the people around him the plot is predictable and very dull the wet t shirt contest may be the worst scene i've ever watched and is almost worth watching in a mystery science type of deal the sound is at times hard to hear and the main actor seems to not know how to speak clearly his accent makes him very hard to understand the only bright sport is the acting of penelope ann miller her role is underdeveloped but she plays it well in short do not waste your time
<START> this is one of the rare movies that i did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it this wasn't because it had particularly <UNK> or impressed me the contrary it had given me nothing at all br br why because somehow everything was so much overdone that i couldn't take this film seriously anymore there was so much sex and violence that i got the strong impression that the film was trying very very hard to be offensive as if it was aiming at <UNK> in <UNK> rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime br br <UNK> <UNK> had been described as thelma louise with actual sex to me well it is true that the main idea is similar there are two women traveling through the country because they've committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now that the police are going to catch them and they decide that now that <UNK> over anyway there is no way to hold back br br <UNK> <UNK> had been described as a feminist film where women who had suffered from male <UNK> in the past exact revenge upon the men that they encounter br br this is something that i had never interpreted into this film simply because none of these women had ever been innocent and because they do not just kill irresponsible violent men but also men that they seduce themselves men that show the sense of wanting to do <UNK> sex and they kill women no they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous brutal ways br br how easily the <UNK> decide to murder and how much pleasure they take in it made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way or even take them seriously it was just all too much too much sex too much violence i got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a <UNK> in <UNK> rather than in conveying a story or making a point br br <UNK> <UNK> left me with no impression hadn't set me thinking because it was so far removed from any real world so constructed unrealistic and over the top br br there was nothing that i could do with this film there was simply nothing about it to think about other than why did they make this terrible film had the intense <UNK> going on in this film served a purpose i'd easily accepted it but since i found nothing since the film's story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film i <UNK> it away under unnecessary torture decided to never ever ever watch this film again and i now consider this to be the worst film i've ever seen br br worst not just because it really isn't my cup of tea to watch people get raped rape have sex in other forms and kill one another but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film if they wanted to say anything at all it just didn't work and there's nothing else that could save this film because it's also filmed in such an ugly style
<START> this movie gave me recurring nightmares with alan voice representing an <UNK> <UNK> fascist <UNK> the scariest movie i have ever seen psychological terror more powerful than anything any horror movie has ever achieved alan voice will always represent to me the power and terror of a <UNK> state reminiscent of <UNK> 1984 this movie describes to those who don't care the reality of a large part of current world <UNK> this film is disturbing but in a way that everyone should watch it it's a description of a reality that no one should ever have to experience but so many do
<START> first of all i must say i really enjoy watching this movie the way we follow the different people at the same time works perfectly and its one of those movies that really makes you think br br spoiler br br the fact that the the girls who kills herself is the one you don't notice that fact made me wonder since thats why she commits suicide in the movie the director impressed me with that making a movie that shows the plot to the audience and also deliver the message that not a lot of people would have seen it coming some people might start talking about why no one did anything to stop it before she did it but no one noticed her just like no one who watched the movie did either don't know about you but i did not guess that it would be her who committed suicide did you br br regards jan
<START> im warning you people out there this is just a waste of your time i am being honest when i'm saying that this is the worst movie i've ever seen its just a move about christian propaganda don't throw away your life don't see it br br i think they made the movie so more people will believe in jesus or something but it works in the opposite way the actors are all <UNK> the story is just fuzzy br br i think this movie is a work of the devil br br this movie is just not worth seeing so please take my advice and don't
<START> we just saw this film <UNK> before release at the <UNK> <UNK> film forum and there was general <UNK> on two matters there were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others and secondly the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster we saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary <UNK> some sort of <UNK> sexual relationship between samuel jackson and <UNK> <UNK> whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas what's sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too heavy for them while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn't be caught dead walking into the theater showing it too bad a good film wasted
<START> the red circle jean pierre <UNK> france italy 1970 br br this might be the coolest film ever made in the most literal sense of the term the men here never lose control and never not once show their emotions no dramatic <UNK> in this film everyone is cool all the time it's an abstract dream world where the men live by their own code a gangster code with the values of the outside world <UNK> absent in this masterfully filmed heist saga <UNK> <UNK> the american crime thriller in his distinctly dark and desolate style yet made in grand fashion with a <UNK> budget of ten million dollars and with four of the greatest french stars at the time <UNK> <UNK> as the master thief <UNK> <UNK> as an alcoholic ex cop italian star <UNK> maria as an escaped criminal and <UNK> in an <UNK> role as the cynical police chief br br <UNK> described le <UNK> as his <UNK> film and it is indeed a masterfully stylized <UNK> he also claimed he wanted to shoot a film noir in colour and in many ways he succeeded the two primary influences for this film were john <UNK> 1950 heist movie the <UNK> jungle and jules <UNK> <UNK> 1955 but unlike these films where we learn much about the background of the individual gang members with all their petty needs and <UNK> that <UNK> them making clear these are not just ruthless underworld types but ordinary individuals engaged in a world of everyday <UNK> and human <UNK> <UNK> though tells us almost nothing about his criminals why was corey <UNK> <UNK> in jail why was his associate <UNK> jean marie arrested in the first place or why the ex police <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> left the force was it his alcoholism we never learn the motivations behind their actions and never find out what drives these men women are even more absent than in his earlier films with the emotional ties exclusively between men they don't even seem to have personal lives a sort of an emotional twilight zone and although the setting is not as abstract as in his earlier le <UNK> 1967 <UNK> still sketches a very eerie world <UNK> favorite actor <UNK> <UNK> is perfect and almost <UNK> himself in <UNK> if imaginable br br deliberately paced and with a length of over <UNK> minutes <UNK> takes his time to tell the story but its slow pace and length seems a perfect way to show the desolate world these men live in nothing is ever out of place in <UNK> films and here it's no different every little detail seemingly of pivotal importance for the story although le <UNK> remains my favorite <UNK> film even up there with the greatest films ever made this one also belongs to the very best br br camera <UNK> 10 10
<START> forever strong is one of those sports movies you can actually watch it reminded me a lot of remember the <UNK> because it included comedy sadness and just <UNK> i saw it at a pre screening and all my friends liked it and easily put it in their top 2 sport movies the acting is great in the movie even though it is similar to remember the <UNK> it there is something very unique about this movie i feel this is definitely oscar worthy and will receive many awards everybody should definitely go see this movie and it is worth your 10 i'm going to have to see it again when it comes out because it was that good i cant say one bad thing about the movie
<START> i will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the hideous plot lines i'll just say that this movie suffers from poor animation over acting obvious tag <UNK> these are some of it's good qualities if you are deserted on an isolated island and the only link to civilization you got is this movie throw it to the fish i can't tell you how much i'm sorry i saw this horrifying ghastly movie speaking of which this movie supposedly a horror movie cannot be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the playing <UNK> of some of the actors br br take care
<START> this film is terrible not only is the story unbelievable the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly to the point where it isn't shocking i find it sad that daisy star of <UNK> the secret garden decided that this would be a career step the idea is interesting two young girls coming of age very quickly but the sex isn't even <UNK> the film is silly the story is silly the performances are silly and the whole concept while interesting falls flat i'm sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after they've had their first period and tried to <UNK> their <UNK> down the toilet better luck next time guys my scale t scale
<START> the timing of this film being released could not be better particularly in light of all the turmoil in this world today the film is a heartwarming endearing and witty a piece if you have siblings and still have parents alive this will hit home well for the viewer if you've lost your parents then it will touch you deeply the laughs come frequently the ensemble cast works very well together and are believable this film is intelligently written and the lines that come from each of the actors make the viewer laugh out loud frequently there are moments that will bring tears to your eyes as well i would recommend this film to anyone who respects the of family and can follow an intelligent film
<START> it may be although there are still two or three i've missed this film <UNK> an interesting <UNK> <UNK> reminiscent of so many <UNK> scenes from sherlock holmes movies and it with sinister <UNK> <UNK> characters into their midst the movie drops <UNK> <UNK> who sounds like she's still playing hannah and woody allen who seems to be <UNK> his <UNK> role from play it again sam are we supposed to laugh at his <UNK> and hand <UNK> i suppose i would if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy but it's not at least i don't think it is
<START> stranded in space 1972 mst3k version a very not good tv movie pilot for a never to be made series in which an astronaut finds himself trapped on <UNK> evil twin having a planet of identical size and mass <UNK> in the same plane as the earth but on the opposite side of the sun is a well worn sf <UNK> the idea is over 2 000 years old having been invented by the ancient <UNK> in this version the counter world is run as an <UNK> <UNK> society where for totally inexplicable reasons everyone speaks english and drives late model american cars after escaping from his hospital the <UNK> is chased around not southern california by tv and bad movie <UNK> cameron mitchell who like his <UNK> wears double <UNK> suits and black <UNK> neck <UNK> a <UNK> evil combination which i fully intend to adopt if ever i become a <UNK> <UNK> our hero escapes several times before ending up <UNK> at the alien world's three <UNK> and wondering <UNK> if he will ever get home thus setting up one of those man alone in a hostile world making a new friend each week but moving on at the end of every episode shows so beloved of the industry in the 70s and 80s 'the 'the incredible 'the <UNK> etc the curiously <UNK> bit though was the title sequence somewhere between in <UNK> first airing under the title 'the <UNK> in 1972 and the mst3k version in 1991 it somehow acquired some footage from the 1983 movie of the lost so in 1991 the opening credits for in <UNK> run under a few shots of three people falling into a matter <UNK> and <UNK> it's a sequence that has nothing to do even <UNK> with anything that is going to follow br br just to add to the nerdy b movie confusion one of the actors in this nailed on footage kay <UNK> later appeared in a 1994 movie called in <UNK> knowing this fact could never save your life but it might score you very big points and <UNK> looks from fellow trash movie <UNK> if you could ever work out a way of the conversation round to the point where you could casually slip it in without looking like a total idiot
<START> human traffic is purely a been there done <UNK> experience  only this time it's quite limp br br major themes explored are paranoia male <UNK> and jealousy  but only mildly and poorly br br a lot of the movie seems to want to imitate <UNK> drug culture  but it fails to include the low times come downs that <UNK> deals with <UNK> issues with death <UNK> etc it even tries to come up with a similar monologue to ewan classic choose <UNK> speech  but the <UNK> bars are on me yeah '  what the <UNK> is that all about br br the characters try to <UNK> their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so shallow  their analysis becomes boring and <UNK> br br the soundtrack for a movie that is trying to be cool is pathetic it includes the likes of fat boy slim and <UNK>  come on people  good dance music is be better than this br br the characters become grating and annoying especially half way through the movie and the lack of care for the characters soon <UNK> br br there are a couple of funny scenes  but they are few and far between the mother catching the son in the bedroom was quite amusing br br but please  i'm sick to death of the star wars <UNK> scenes i thought it was much more <UNK> in a couple of kevin smith's movies ie <UNK> and chasing amy according to the characters  <UNK> is a drug fiend hence that's why he is short and bald  huh br br my score  4 out of 10  do yourself a favour and see <UNK> or go instead
<START> i used to enjoy happy ever after but was absolutely <UNK> by terry june with aunt lucy gone the emphasis seemed to fall more heavily on the relationship between terry and june a middle aged middle class english couple and i thoroughly enjoyed it losing myself quite happily in each episode br br the 1980s were the era of alternative comedy but they were also the decade of choice and terry and june certainly suited more traditional tastes and mine and i was a huge fan of the young ones too each week terry got into a silly situation and june got pulled in herself and usually ended up having to <UNK> him out how dated the shows seem now it was a different world but it's great fun to see <UNK> of the 1980s featured such as the <UNK> radio storyline of 1982 <UNK> radio was <UNK> in england in november 1981 which saw terry imprisoned in his car in the back of a <UNK> i've been watching the shows again recently on dvd and i still think they're terrific not loved by the <UNK> elite the <UNK> classes but a huge hit with the masses wonderful
<START> this is a really silly job of <UNK> about as bad as hepburn playing a chinese woman in dragon seed the lead part hepburn plays is a combination of <UNK> from the beverly <UNK> and a faith <UNK> this film is even worse than <UNK> swing your lady because at least bogart didn't play a <UNK> he was just surrounded by them and the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a <UNK> <UNK> strip the problems don't really end with the outrageous casting though as the plot is completely muddled and the love story might make your head hurt for no reason whatsoever married robert young falls for this <UNK> <UNK> was it her lovely personality that won his heart i doubt it as she as the fiery <UNK> the movie was named after and she really seemed to like <UNK> and and <UNK> was it her feminine charms with no makeup and fashions that looked like they were designed by ma <UNK> i doubt if this was the case as well to top this off in the end somehow ralph <UNK> also fell for her though once again it really doesn't seem to make any sense br br so here we have two city <UNK> for a <UNK> she beast played by ms hepburn now that's a recipe for a good film
<START> everyone told me to see <UNK> flower and i finally did what a wonderful movie the perfect pick me up for a sunday night <UNK> monday morning matthau and hawn were good but ingrid bergman really made this movie after all it was really about her the truly great actors can do anything and miss bergman proves it she shows us in the course of one film a range few people display in their entire career the scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion i found myself cheering for miss dickinson as if she were the boston red sox thankfully she made out no pun intended much better
<START> for a tv movie this was <UNK> worth seeing all the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme i have not read seen the original and as a rule i can't stand shakespeare but i enjoyed this movie the civil war setting was very well done as well dont expect to see an epic however you should find it moving enough to enjoy by the way on a side note don't compare this or any other movie for that matter to the original work movies aren't supposed to transfer a book to the screen but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it when people say the book was so much better they're usually wrong anyway what they are really trying to say is the book was so different
<START> just as ted kramer dustin hoffman is about to get a break in his professional life his frustrated wife joanna meryl streep finally gets up the courage to leave him leaving ted to care for their five year old son justin henry being a single parent proves to be quite the chore for ted and he suffers <UNK> but also learns there's much more to life than a career as he continues to bond with and really get to know his own son but then joanna returns and <UNK> to get her son back which leads to a cruel custody trial br br kramer vs kramer is a superbly well written and <UNK> acted human drama that will only leave the most cold hearted a viewer <UNK> <UNK> growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed and the film never takes an easy way out it always feels very real and thanks to the film's low key approach it makes even more of an impact and can easily work upon multiple viewings the film's dramatic impact does not <UNK> br br easily recommended 10 out of 10
<START> it's less visceral than the only other <UNK> film i've seen <UNK> <UNK> but the idea of <UNK> holes into <UNK> emotions and <UNK> is vividly portrayed here as <UNK> sets up long shot after long shot usually with long takes suggesting a sense of alienation in <UNK> the musical <UNK> inspired by grace chang are <UNK> but welcome mile <UNK> that add new <UNK> to the slowly <UNK> relationship between the young man upstairs and the woman <UNK> it's not necessarily an easy film to watch although it's not heavy handed by any means so i'd warn any casual viewers who are looking for some indie entertainment like tarantino or guy ritchie but if you'd like to know something about isolation among city <UNK> in <UNK> and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning then watch this film immediately
<START> lois <UNK> film <UNK> was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film i enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it the priest sees the <UNK> of the people in his church and tries to show them the naked truth the people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth after failing to lead them to it and the few that did help along the way the people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong but it shows them putting things before god going to beach parties acting inappropriate their <UNK> ways and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right in the end failing to gain any followers he must enter into the gates of heaven alone this film seems to me to be very bold in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it especially considering the time period in which this film was made the imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie i found incredible the way they made the naked woman <UNK> and using a naked woman to <UNK> the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path each with different excuses <UNK> and or higher <UNK> was a great way of representing the people of today this film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience lois <UNK> has a tremendous way of capturing her <UNK> attention with her creativity symbolism visuals and through <UNK> even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme
<START> i don't usually like tv movies i <UNK> that if the thing was any good it would make it to hollywood this one though is better than average pretty high production values a few interesting story twists and some nice shots of nyc along with toronto hold the interest
<START> <UNK> blues is a drama through and through it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby s rachel is referred to as <UNK> by all who know her but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman she <UNK> strength will power confidence and resolve she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject her <UNK> consisted of a lesbian a psychotic war veteran an <UNK> and a host of other <UNK> that made the home miles away from ordinary each <UNK> event rachel took in <UNK> and handled <UNK> she wasn't a dictator devoid of compassion but in fact she was quite the opposite she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and <UNK> to so many that she seemed to over <UNK> herself br br did a good job but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway the movie had an even <UNK> never <UNK> from rachel there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself
<START> every sunday is an eleven minute short subject featuring the talents of two of its young juvenile contract players a pair who would develop into players of note in the future it's interesting and entertaining to see the <UNK> styles of judy garland and deanna durbin as they perform at a sunday concert for <UNK> uncle br br of course no one knew how big both of these young ladies would get to be i've always wondered why <UNK> kept garland and let durbin go to universal l b always had <UNK> to culture and this was the guy who had <UNK> macdonald at his studio and later on hired such lovely soprano voices as jane powell ann <UNK> <UNK> etc br br judy certainly had her glorious career at mgm but she paid a heavy price for it deanna along with <UNK> <UNK> and several gothic horror monsters <UNK> universal pictures she was smart enough to get out at the top and make it stick br br so in their <UNK> days deanna durbin and judy garland
<START> despite having an absolutely horrid script more about that later this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors barbara stanwyck and henry fonda aside from one or two real <UNK> i'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film as i am a huge fan of hollywood's golden age of the 1930s and 40s however no matter how much i love their films i just can't recommend this film br br the movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some <UNK> resort the two haven't yet met but the film begins <UNK> and <UNK> with a scene in which fonda horribly while <UNK> it was done so <UNK> and made my teeth <UNK> but i stuck it out especially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the in <UNK> perhaps i should have just turned it off then fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help back at the <UNK> <UNK> he seems okay but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x <UNK> and <UNK> him back to health he in turn becomes <UNK> with her and <UNK> to her despite hardly knowing each other they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy br br once home however all isn't <UNK> as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins <UNK> signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy the film plays it all for laughs but frankly <UNK> <UNK> were really creepy <UNK> on her and her male patients attacking or threatening any man she treats <UNK> a patient who already has a back injury and <UNK> into a surprise party and <UNK> that everyone there men and women are out to steal away his wife he comes off as a combination of a <UNK> and paranoid <UNK> but it's all supposed to be for laughs considering that he seems like a dangerous nut you would think that stanwyck would file for an along with a <UNK> order but oddly she gets mad but just can't stay mad at fonda because he's so i can't think of the right word is all that comes to mind later out of the blue multi millionaire fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store then through magical thinking he and <UNK> seem to assume his <UNK> and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past so a job apparently <UNK> anger and <UNK> when this job falls through the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital giving barbara a job there and they live happily ever after they don't go any further with the story but i assume based on <UNK> character that he then spent most of his time as hospital <UNK> beating up all the male patients br br the first portion at the <UNK> <UNK> and the next did not fit well together nor did the final <UNK> <UNK> inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world they were like three separate plots but despite this the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and <UNK> jealousy what a creepy little film thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this film but for all their other lovely films
<START> this movie reminds me old b movies but not in a good way br br when i saw the first scene i thought it was going to be a spoof of one of those early sf films the terrible acting the plastic props and the noticeable visual effects gave me that impression br br but no the movie is really that bad the story is a complete nonsense the effects are below the level of a tv production even the editing is a mess br br the only thing that kept me in the theater was that i wanted to know the end of the story although i was pretty sure it was going to be silly and it was br br there are better ways to spend your time and money
<START> thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck this one was another totally unexpected gem usually i'm not even a suspense thriller fan this satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a <UNK> <UNK> it has <UNK> erotic romance reminiscent of body heat in more ways than one it has cops and crime political intrigue and just a dash of daytime soap it has just the right touch of gritty violence that any professional by the numbers crime job must employ emma thompson fbi delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for best fake southern accent by a <UNK> alan <UNK> local cop who always seems to steal the show is excellent but not overbearing they work well as a pair lots of plot <UNK> that never gets out of control and gets <UNK> at film's end and who is this awesome woman carla i want her to bear my children carla if you're out there let's do lunch
<START> this tale of the upper classes getting their come <UNK> and <UNK> in their high class misery is like a contemporary mid version of an old joan crawford movie in which she suffered in <UNK> here people behave in a <UNK> <UNK> manner in the face of <UNK> a well <UNK> london <UNK> tom <UNK> discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local <UNK> but that she has also killed their <UNK> husband in a hit and run accident he throws up but otherwise his stiff upper lip hardly br br written and directed by julian <UNK> who won an oscar for writing <UNK> park this is his directorial debut from a novel by <UNK> it's quite comical although i am not sure how much of the comedy is intended it's like a throw back to british films of the forties where characters all <UNK> like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life however it's not all bad <UNK> is terrific even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson the <UNK> wife and rupert everett the highly amoral high class <UNK> are both very good at covering the cracks in the material tony pierce <UNK> cinematography <UNK> that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye
<START> jim brown stars and produces a tale set in the <UNK> just after the japanese invasion the story has the japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some <UNK> who they use to retrieve the gold that macarthur had dumped into the <UNK> bay br br it's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism the film uses <UNK> war in a not so subtle montage the performances are just adequate at best jim brown is okay but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed the sets are <UNK> but seem rather cheap the film suffers from the outset due to a great deal of stock footage including many of the best known shots from the japanese attack in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the use of such big budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively <UNK> it also reminds one that there are better films out there one could be watching for me the film seems to have half a real plot the <UNK> of the silver and half a plot that is there just to fill time none of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale br br given the choice i'd take a pass
<START> <UNK> is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings originally written by william shakespeare in the early <UNK> <UNK> tells the story of betrayal among <UNK> and one man's quest for power director geoffrey wright <UNK> tries his hand at <UNK> <UNK> by setting it in the contemporary melbourne underworld a film where the characters substitute swords for guns ala <UNK> romeo and juliet and royal for gangsters <UNK> is a gritty violent but <UNK> flawed film br br <UNK> sam works for king <UNK> gary sweet after being <UNK> to the of by the king as was <UNK> to <UNK> by three witches <UNK> starts setting his eyes on the throne one night the king comes to stay at <UNK> house and lady <UNK> victoria hill talks him into killing the king to assume power <UNK> kills his master and then assumes his crown but success has it's downside as <UNK> soon finds out when he has to go to hideous <UNK> to protect his murderous secret br br ok first things first the film's major fault is sam his portrayal of <UNK> is in a word boring i honestly didn't care about <UNK> while watching the film i had more sympathy for victoria <UNK> lady <UNK> because she bothered to act at least sits <UNK> and wood faced throughout the entire film i felt like he was doing his best impression of johnny george <UNK> character from blow but without the charisma i have never seen in a film before so i'm not sure if it was his or the director's fault but either way the <UNK> that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak br br the dialog is good but when matched up to the geoffrey <UNK> australian gangster <UNK> seems a bit out of place paced action sequences mixed with long <UNK> creates pacing conflict within the film i understand that this is <UNK> and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact but hard fast action scenes following a three minute <UNK> tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious br br the camera work is highly stylized and for the most part it works well one thing that i found annoying was how the camera would slowly <UNK> back and forth almost constantly i don't mind shots like that it's just overdone it's passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating other than that the art direction and cinematography is fairly well done br br for all of the good qualities <UNK> possesses stylish direction <UNK> dialog a strong soundtrack supernatural nude witches the weird sisters and good <UNK> of brutal bloody violence all of these strengths are forgotten when one considers sam uninspired portrayal of <UNK> the role of <UNK> was essential for <UNK> everything together and in this respect geoffrey wright and sam failed miserably making <UNK> a forgettable <UNK> into shakespeare
<START> no doubt about it <UNK> is gorgeous a classic beauty here very young she manages to appear simultaneously sophisticated and poignant her two male <UNK> act well too but seen in 2003 the <UNK> is all br br american trying to be artsy and not be hollywood while shooting beautiful sh of the french <UNK> and three pretty young people in their cute old <UNK> r i enjoyed the view both the actors and the nature but the movie is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite
<START> last week i watched a royal shakespeare company production of <UNK> it was 25 years old filmed w no props except swords no furniture except <UNK> it was riveting the acting was super all the actors trained brits contrast that performance to this yawn yawn yawn al pacino as <UNK> was tragic heavy and couldn't quite lose the new <UNK> accent despite the long pauses between lines the whole thing was <UNK> even the comic scenes were barely even worth a smile let a lone a belly laugh this is supposed to be funny they tried to make it tragic it was neither just boring i give it four points for costumes scenery and jeremy <UNK> who is good at playing a dull depressed deep voiced guy can he be anything else
<START> six students at a convent do the <UNK> kill a nun who was overbearing now <UNK> years later the <UNK> spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder br br <UNK> basically that's the short of it there's more to it than that but i still have no clue what it is the only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun as i was pretty impressed for being a more low budget flick i'm also confused as to whether or not it's in english most of the actors are italian and even the title here is in italian yet they spoke english in the film i think or it <UNK> been dubbed i still can't tell br br anyway the real premise of the film is pretty idiotic and the ending not only doesn't make sense it well doesn't make sense
<START> the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine <UNK> who's a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep unfortunately he can't oh yeah and he's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a <UNK> when he was a child the guy meets some scientist <UNK> pretty hot and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character's submarine to kill the same <UNK> that killed his parents now the shark in this movie is a really fake looking cgi shark basically this is sorta like shark attack 3 except more depressing if you don't get what i mean listen the film's opening credits show home movies of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they got killed and there's really sad and depressing piano music playing in the background you would expect to see a shark or something and you do a brief shadow of the cgi shark <UNK> around every few seconds but that's just it also i don't remember one happy facial expression at all throughout the film's entire runtime a majority of the film takes place in the dark depths of the <UNK> where the story gets even more dull and all the characters the shark too die in the end i was thinking <UNK> would manage to kill the shark and manage to save himself and the girl but no they all die and the film ends with the shark all blown up and the submarine with <UNK> crushed and burned body in it sinking into the <UNK> if you're a happy person and you don't enjoy being depressed then avoid this movie if you're the opposite then <UNK> you found your movie
<START> rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star unfortunately her career is getting no where in danny <UNK> night club when one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a cover girl contest she decides to follow her dreams and enters she reminds the <UNK> of her grandma who he was deeply in love with many years ago but when she finds this success her boyfriend is not happy about it br br i had never seen rita before this and i am so glad i did she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress there are some good numbers in here not the best of any musical but they are <UNK> and good to listen to one thing i didn't like was gene kelly's character he should have supported his girlfriend but anyway that's perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie cover girl is a glorious <UNK> film perfect <UNK> not everyone's ideal movie but a wonderful movie nonetheless due to rita <UNK> star power great movie truly impressed
<START> topless touch football a wet t shirt contest a raid this house has it all except a plot and good actors the film consists of several pranks and <UNK> between the h o t s girls and the bitchy <UNK> house the <UNK> is a scream and the soundtrack is <UNK> brilliant over the past couple of months it's been popping up all over cable so do yourself a favor and watch out for it h o t s is so bad it's good
<START> i have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim shown on the bed with the missing <UNK> as the camera pans up and away from her face <UNK> yes <UNK> i recorded it as it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i was not seeing things of course after that it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with julian <UNK> very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim <UNK> in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body face too bad
<START> first nick pearl harbor was bombed in 1941 not 1942 they didn't have to predict the bombing br br second did nobody notice these six <UNK> lawyers whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time they were killed before the surgery took place third how the heck did lugosi get out of <UNK> without being seen fourth why did the japanese not just kill him instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look alike companion and his <UNK> <UNK> fifth oh what's the use this movie has a few interesting moments in it but by the time they explain what's going on you'll probably have stopped watching if not you won't care
<START> a beautifully constructed and brilliantly acted comedy there is not a person in the cast who does not <UNK> himself or herself with hilarious distinction however the real star of the film is the unseen director frank oz who brings all the <UNK> sensibility and wit to this farce that he brought to miss <UNK> encounters with <UNK> the frog this is a not to be missed film
<START> i watched this last <UNK> with an open mind sorry to say it is still bad first the movie is too and you can't hear what people are saying the accents are bad especially richard what is the french chick doing in this film <UNK> at its worst <UNK> makeup is strange the <UNK> scene is useless and not needed character is unlikeable and i wanted him to get killed and go away meanwhile the walken character gets killed too early and easily despite the makeup the <UNK> are all stupid get organized you bunch of <UNK> people are coming to kill you john hurts character provides some humor <UNK> thats all br br i have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap the only good thing is it ruined the director's career and killed united artists br br still crap after all these years
<START> it's amazing that this no talent actor got all these well known stars to appear in this dismal pathetic cheesy and overlong film about a low life gangster who looks white but is half mexican much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this trashy movie are given a script that seems made up by a 16 year old i'm sure this movie is the career low point for actors such as <UNK> wagner <UNK> <UNK> and busey who i'm sure are very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey of a film i doubt many people have ever heard of and after this terrible movie i'm sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs
<START> i can't understand why many seem to hate this br br this movie ties together many of the <UNK> settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties using set pieces props and costumes similar to those seen in other movies here however the story attempts to run through all of human history with a frame story about the human race being on trial with a guilty verdict meaning h bombs will go off all over the world the <UNK> is the devil played with <UNK> glee by vincent price ok so it's a little hokey calling the <UNK> the spirit of all men but i think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm the <UNK> of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman in his last film it is also the last movie in which <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> marx all appear but not together <UNK> plays buying manhattan from the indians in a scene played purely for campy humor <UNK> isn't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat and <UNK> we are told is meant to be <UNK> <UNK> discovering gravity most of the other performances are well done though br br other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space which is depicted as a region of clouds and there is something called the great clock of outer space which when striking midnight may <UNK> the end of the world br br but at its heart the movie <UNK> the problems of and the eternal question of whether man is basically good or basically evil and poses it in what i think is an interesting way also anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie
<START> this movie <UNK> no money no acting no nothing i caught this on on the <UNK> late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it this movie has nothing to recommend it i can't believe it ever got released to us television nobody in this movie can act their way out of a the lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face the special effects consist of a worm like monster i can't even begin to tell you how rock bottom this production is it looks like it cost maybe 50 000 to shoot but only because it is on <UNK> and that is probably a generous <UNK> anyway i lost interest rapidly and had to settle for watching <UNK> reruns instead of finishing it that's how bad this movie is
<START> well this was the last pay per view event of the millennium and it ended the year and millennium right the huge story line of stephanie and <UNK> started right here at this event when <UNK> turned on her dad vince <UNK> had a great match with <UNK> and this event is very good i give it a 9
<START> hi everyone oh boy this one is a <UNK> it has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in there are three bad guys who i guess are the stars of this they beat people up and chop people up and crash <UNK> and <UNK> into people usual stuff br br the woman who is sending them on their missions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks it's sort of like watching a bad <UNK> who is her own <UNK> she walks like she is <UNK> an egg on her head br br the wardrobe is 70s <UNK> style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse the bad <UNK> mouth woman wears red a <UNK> <UNK> perhaps or maybe just a <UNK> that is too big br br i actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense it lets us in on what happened earlier in the film br br the police officers are ok some bad some good all stupid except two the two bright ones could have worked again in hollywood br br the movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise the middle sucks the guy in the diner who gives a free <UNK> to the star does a good job he is like a 1940s character actor great voice br br this one is a bit too long the lady with <UNK> in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot it would have been easier to understand a bird br br her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained <UNK> br br tom <UNK>
<START> i have only see three episodes of hack starring david morse and it looks as though i've missed <UNK> episodes well thats if <UNK> 3 are showing them in <UNK> order i've just watched episode <UNK> i have really enjoyed the 3 episodes but then i'm a david morse fan <UNK> st elsewhere for any one reading this hack is excellent pity its being aired on <UNK> 3 the cast is strong though i cant get used to the idea of david playing a bent cop still we all know he's the good guy wrongly accused i see gary cole has guest starred what ever happened to <UNK> just wonder if hack is available on dvd yet <UNK> it cheers
<START> even a bad julie andrews musical is worth watching and this isn't bad in fact it's quite entertaining actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a <UNK> <UNK> br br to break <UNK> <UNK> two shoes mold she plays a german spy english musical hall actress she subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie s o b and play a drag queen in victor victoria and other not so <UNK> girls usually under <UNK> blake <UNK> direction br br the movie is admittedly <UNK> it is hard to feel for her character because she's a german spy we want to love julie but she's on the wrong side of the law probably this is why this movie <UNK> julie as a german spy our mary <UNK> our maria van <UNK> suddenly a german spy br br the romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere but never mind it's a musical and it has oh and did i mention hunky rock hudson is in it too br br julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss great <UNK> 1 songs and nice tunes by <UNK> br br yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn't seem logical for example why is julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the germans when a minute ago she was <UNK> for them br br but on another note who cares the musical numbers are fun and exciting the costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish the cinematography quite on the mark br br it has the annoying idiot detectives that blake <UNK> puts in all his movies yawn br br but it has julie trying desperately to change her image you can imagine dinner with blake and julie julie blake we need to change my image br br blake i will make you a german spy then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a <UNK> in a another movie they won't recognize you it will be the death of maria von <UNK> br br fascinating study on changing an image wonderful julie a must see for musical comedy buffs much more entertaining than star

<START> some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking down the steps in the <UNK> <UNK> sequence these men are not but regular army troops br br the arrive at the scene a little later and they are the men on horses <UNK> at the crowd with their <UNK> br br to experts on russian history correct me on this if i'm wrong br br but there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently no one has commented on after the <UNK> of the <UNK> someone in the crowd on shore says kill the jews this is on screen for only a couple of seconds but it is there br br how <UNK> typical of history not just in russia but in so many other countries to immediately and <UNK> blame jews for any domestic trouble br br perhaps other parts of the movie are not historically factual but the <UNK> against the jews is all too real comments anyone br br also why can't <UNK> of english learn to <UNK> the name as <UNK> instead of as <UNK> there's a need in russian to <UNK> the two possible <UNK> of e as either <UNK> or as <UNK> sometimes two <UNK> are used to <UNK> these two <UNK> but usually the difference simply has to be <UNK>
<START> disappointing is the best word i could think for this film especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users br br one thing that really <UNK> the film is that it is <UNK> partial in both senses of the word not only does it present a very <UNK> description of the games <UNK> as it does on the us <UNK> team but it also contains several inaccuracies most of which serve to <UNK> the difficulties the us team faced br br what is even more disturbing is that all the <UNK> and mistakes appear to <UNK> us <UNK> to the <UNK> of other <UNK> with a few celebrated exceptions for example the viewer is led to believe that the us won the majority of <UNK> in the games when in fact they won only one out of four gold <UNK> and one out of 6 total similarly many <UNK> are portrayed as caricatures of their respective <UNK> thus we have an arrogant brit and a wine <UNK> french this attitude does very little service to the olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate br br in conclusion i believe that this film would appeal to that part of the us audience that is looking for a quick boost of national self <UNK> those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere
<START> hitchcock made at least 11 films about the ordinary man wrongly accused on the run sometimes really running sometimes not to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control the first one being the <UNK> steps which really made him popular in great britain it really is his signature theme br br others include young and innocent <UNK> <UNK> stage fright strangers on a train i confess to catch a thief the wrong man north by <UNK> and finally frenzy <UNK> starts robert <UNK> as barry kane a wartime aircraft plant worker during wartime accused of murdering his co worker and best friend during an act of <UNK> on the plant he meets up with model patricia martin played by actress <UNK> lane during his run from the law and later of course the various nazi fascist <UNK> along the way br br <UNK> is mainly like the <UNK> steps even including similar plot devices such as <UNK> the blonde who doesn't trust the main character in the beginning a race across the country in one case london to scotland and in the other california to new york and meeting the colorful locals along the way and so just like the man who knew too much i believe this is an american remake of one of hitchcock's earlier works br br i think robert <UNK> was chosen because he comes across as a very ordinary american sort of an <UNK> with whom the audience can identify i like <UNK> lane because her character is a more involved in the action than <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> steps and ruth roman in strangers on a train as mentioned elsewhere though otto <UNK> steals the show as the villain i also liked <UNK> performance as the blind uncle his lines are great there are some funny touches all along the way for some comic relief such as road signs featuring <UNK> <UNK> character on them and circus <UNK> performers and the truck driver murray contrary to other opinions here there aren't too many characters who believe barry <UNK> innocence immediately br br there are some slow parts mainly when the action first moves to new york but it picks up quickly when the last planned act of the fifth <UNK> gets <UNK> br br it's one of my favorite films from hitchcock i put it in my top 5 especially in these days of the new war on terrorism i think it hits home br br it makes you think could my <UNK> be involved in something evil in fact one of the movie posters for <UNK> <UNK> watch out for the man behind your back imagine how that played in the mind of adults during the second world war
<START> if you want to really <UNK> people choose the devil as your subject after all a good deal of the population believe that he is real therefore you are <UNK> into a whole <UNK> <UNK> of pre existing religious and <UNK> imagery and bound to cause quite a few nightmares in your young audience br br this episode had all the appearance of a hollywood blockbuster in fact having finished watching it i <UNK> over to another channel which was playing a recent bond film and quite frankly couldn't split a hair between the differences in <UNK> with a minimal cast <UNK> by its situation on a space station complete with overwhelming <UNK> views of an universe it was as claustrophobic and intense as alien or event the black hole outside made it feel as if the black weight of dark matter was <UNK> the station onto the planet and to whatever was sealed inside and as the horror is <UNK> by the knowledge that the dr and rose are stranded the sinister <UNK> start <UNK> a <UNK> voice and then the characters start being picked off one by one br br this has all the best qualities of the cream of this new dr who <UNK> girl in the <UNK> and the empty child emotionally engaging frightening and humorous all without seeming cheesy this is far scarier than any amount of flying <UNK> but it has to be asked is this really suitable viewing for children this is not a family friendly episode pity the poor parent who has to put their kids to bed after this one i'm not sure i even want to see what happens next
<START> not really sure what to make of this movie very weird very artsy not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling plot or characters more like the kind of movie that you can't stop watching because of the <UNK> fascinating things happening on screen although the first time my wife watched this she couldn't make it all the way through too disturbing for her runs a bit long but nonetheless a worthwhile viewing for those interested in very dark movies
<START> dreadful i hope i can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this i just finished watching the film btw br br i love good cross genre films this isn't one of them show me a sci fi musical a dramatic farce or a religious action flick i'll watch them all but you cannot just throw <UNK> <UNK> at a rambling camp schlock horror fest and draw my applause br br i love philosophical films this isn't one of them anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect <UNK> in this film hasn't read a good book lately or ever the thought provoking dialogue is trite at best perhaps it lost something in the translation br br i love a good horror comedy this isn't one of them laugh i thought i'd never start <UNK> only when trying to think of a polite way to phrase my <UNK> of the film to the friend who recommended it br br rupert is <UNK> good in the setting of this film but even he cannot <UNK> it i only wish he had shot the director instead if the zombies br br for shame that the land that gave rise to the <UNK> should also give rise to this <UNK> would be spinning in his grave
<START> this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts i saw it first in the <UNK> production the first summer it was in p town 2001 before it was curiously enough banned in that <UNK> gay resort the <UNK> which resulted in its closing have since been i saw it again later in the off broadway long running production in new york oddly enough the p town production was far better than the new york one <UNK> <UNK> more spirited and funnier but that was only in the 2001 showing subsequent attempts to clone the production bare naked <UNK> in 2007 were definitely third rate this filmed production features a los <UNK> production cast and it is as other comments have suggested not the best i would rate it somewhere in between the top notch 2001 p town production and the third rate bare naked <UNK> p town show from last summer
<START> is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a witch and i got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is different someone nobody understands she is just a teenager and some dumb girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her besides <UNK> is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so fake she didn't convince me that she is not a witch not that i would believe it in the first place everyone <UNK> her of being a witch and she acts like she is not entirely sure whether she is a witch or not and the way they dressed her for the court i see old ladies every day who wouldn't wear that even if it was the last outfit in the world brother also wasn't very convincing but you see the important thing is that she put that bad bad girl back on to the ground at the end of the film she has won the battle proved to everyone she is different br br this is probably one of the worst films i've watched in may life way too shallow i only watched it because there was nothing else on the tv at the moment so i was condemned to this trash please do not waste your time watching this film when i saw the 7 star rating i nearly <UNK> it doesn't deserve it compared to some other films which are also rated with 7 stars
<START> a couple of <UNK> comments are in order <UNK> gordon lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of doctor gore aka the body shop <UNK> he touched upon his <UNK> efforts with j g pat <UNK> director and star of doctor gore <UNK> <UNK> the gore effects for the gruesome <UNK> and a few other lewis movies in the late 60s lewis remarks that whereas 2 000 <UNK> was a five <UNK> film referring to the amount of stage blood required the lewis <UNK> productions were fifteen <UNK> pictures lewis does not describe doctor gore as a fifteen <UNK> film he's only talking about the films he <UNK> made together lewis has <UNK> elsewhere that his introduction to doctor gore was improvised before he'd even seen film so take it with a grain of salt br br this may be an unfinished film but like some unfinished novels it does have an ending it's just missing some <UNK> br br <UNK> has definite stage presence a dry sense of humor helping to make this simplistic show somewhat more watchable than it should be there's an extremely bare bones plot even blood feast is more complex and a <UNK> repetitive musical score by william a bit of nudity lots of skin the entire middle section of the film involves the construction of a perfect woman this is concentrated gore for the <UNK> and laughable br br <UNK> the director is in way over his head but he tries hard to tell his story <UNK> if it's possible to use frankenstein clichés <UNK> but the best reason to see this film on something <UNK> dvd if possible is that it features a perfect <UNK> <UNK> bill a heart dies every minute ain't it the truth
<START> i don't know what it is about this movie the charisma of the two leads their chemistry on screen the chance to see <UNK> real life son you can't miss him or art performance but i love it i've seen it a few times and never tire of watching it again rent and enjoy
<START> intelligent nail biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in america when life <UNK> the film a nuclear power plant employee in southern california is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant ostensibly a stuck <UNK> problem a tv news <UNK> film shows that it was an accident <UNK> on disastrous proportions and worse that safety conditions are being <UNK> to save millions of dollars a cover up that everyone's lives the movie occasionally gets too technical especially in the second half and could use more human interplay however the performances by jack lemmon jane fonda as a <UNK> piece news woman in the right place at the right time and michael douglas as a <UNK> cameraman are superb the throwaway bits involving nuclear <UNK> is both entirely accurate and <UNK> satirical and the news <UNK> with its corporate structure and vapid yes men is vividly captured 1 2 from
<START> the funniest show ever on tv albeit the humor is not for everyone i realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer but it's a shame only six episodes were filmed the gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end when you would see and his boss ed pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled during which the criminal still moving would see everyone else <UNK> and try to escape in another episode the building started <UNK> around them as and remained in freeze mode br br leslie <UNK> was comedic brilliance as frank and the perfect fit for this show  how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me because the jokes and sight gags came so often and quick you can watch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time if you're like me you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing even the jokes that made no sense nor seemingly had any reason to them such as the rex hamilton as abraham lincoln tag line in the opening <UNK> somehow worked  perhaps they were thrown in there precisely for that reason br br cleverly <UNK> the old quinn martin detective cop shows of the 1970s police squad would return from commercial break with the words act two appearing on the screen which was immediately followed by <UNK> one or some other <UNK> on the opening credits the <UNK> title would appear on the screen but the <UNK> would utter a completely different title my favorite jokes and lines from this series are way too numerous to list but one of my favorites is when asks a down on his luck boxer who has previously <UNK> fights do you think you can beat the <UNK> the boxer responds i can take him <UNK> to which responds back but what if he's not <UNK> a minute later in reference to the <UNK> small <UNK> apartment tells him i'm going to help you get out of this <UNK> the next thing you see is popping up through a <UNK> cover on the street in another episode and are questioning a bombing flimsy <UNK> not believing him says alright let's say you did go the movies after a slight pause and the suspect all look at the camera and in <UNK> say you did go the movies a few moments later when is forced to let the suspected <UNK> walk free due to lack of evidence he <UNK> away and <UNK> yells tell that <UNK> to take off what's seen next is a cop giving the thumbs up <UNK> to a wwii style plane on a <UNK> right outside the building while there were many classic quotes one particularly memorable one was sorry to bother you mrs twice we would have come earlier but your husband wasn't dead then another classic was i'm a  and i'm a when a <UNK> <UNK> kidnap <UNK> father asks what i do i do  in classic deadpan fashion responds back well as i understand it you're in the <UNK> business as i said the humor is not for everyone  many people simply will not get it during the show's brief run i remember the reaction being very mixed some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around while others thought it was the stupid and unfunny for me police squad even 20 years later is the funniest thing i've ever seen on tv for younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but who have never seen police squad because they were too young when the series initially aired i highly recommend i found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent naked gun movies
<START> i regard this loving and <UNK> written story to be one of the <UNK> true masterpieces after having seen this film originally on the silver screen with my mother in los angeles california when it first came out many years passed before i would have the opportunity to experience it again the beauty quiet simplistic <UNK> and <UNK> of the film to me set it aside from many many others of its kind yes tears still come to my eyes when i see it and hear the <UNK> of that once in a lifetime song perhaps still today my number one all time most beloved film i would hope this classic love story will be enjoyed and appreciated by our future generations
<START> capt <UNK> is an old fashioned hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity and supposedly no americans the story takes place on a greek island during ww2 the italians arrive to take over the island but with german <UNK> there is a romantic triangle made up of a greek couple and the italian captain nice performances by all the actors penelope <UNK> best work yet
<START> i was like watching it right and i was all like oh this is so totally awesome full and then i was all like ya quite good indeed so i really enjoyed all the amazing dangers and all the british people and i think that the doctor is very a good doctor in his way of doing such wonderful doctor y things and he was a very strange man and i was like maybe i won't like this guy because hes a new doctor and i like the old doctor thats not this guy but then i watched him and i was like oh this is awesome and i liked it so then i watched and enjoyed the great evil enemies and the great <UNK> of the evil guys and the happy doctor who is quite scary and happy looking
<START> i really only watched this movie because it had rupert in it who i knew as ron from the harry potter movies i had never really appreciated rupert as an actor until this movie i loved the entire film rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious quirky movie i think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow i can't wait to see more of films in the future julie <UNK> also did an amazing job in the harry potter movies she has a very small role so i didn't quite know what to expect from her either but she was wonderful as dame the part where she <UNK> the key was absolutely hilarious overall an amazing movie
<START> i was 13 when this mini series and its sequel north and south book ii first aired i had already been captivated by the personal interest stories in around our american civil war which is what interested me in watching this made for tv program br br i loved it and now i'm <UNK> years old and i only love it more it is full of history beautiful <UNK> real life characters woven in and out of the lives of fictional characters all of whom you come to care deeply about there is intrigue love loyalty betrayal family extended family lust battles victory defeat and <UNK> br br even though i had the full set of episodes on tapes i recorded back when it originally aired i purchased the full set of both n s and n s ii from columbia house some years ago when they became available once every few years i'll take a whole weekend and watch all the <UNK> back to back and am sad when the last episode rolls to an end because i find myself wanting to continue watching the story of the lives of these characters br br i cannot recommend this mini series more highly
<START> i would have given this less than a 1 rating if it were possible the entire film should have been left on the cutting room floor what a pathetic waste of time money and effort let's see <UNK> the <UNK> cast you can find which of course is in direct <UNK> to the amount of talent they lack throw together the <UNK> plot you can dig up and <UNK> an <UNK> piece of trash that the director and or producer should be ashamed to put their name on how much worse can the horror genre get and don't use low budget as an excuse i have seen many great low budget films in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low budget if you don't have the talent and <UNK> to make a good horror film then for god's sake don't make one at all
<START> one night randy matt dillon <UNK> jewel <UNK> tyler from her jealous boyfriend <UNK> andrew <UNK> clay he takes jewel to his home but <UNK> comes back and wants randy to open the safe at <UNK> suddenly a shot dead then better stop here to tell the plot <UNK> like to explain the story of wild things what i found so interesting was the fact that the plot written by stan his first and his last work he died in july last year was told from 3 perspectives the 3 men that fall for jewel everybody of them sees her from different eyes like john goodman as the detective who <UNK> falls in love with her because of being remembered of his dead wife br br no wonder that the guys fall for her <UNK> tyler <UNK> a real jewel she made the big screen shining she played her role as if she was in a noir thriller sweet but in the same time she was the cool <UNK> who walks over dead and uses the men for her needs and of course michael douglas how could i forget him mr the <UNK> playing killer he was quite cool br br but in the last 10 minutes there was a little bit too much slapstick for my taste it <UNK> the atmosphere that part began when paul reiser as cousin carl on his leather dress for jewel the <UNK> song <UNK> fit so much here but altogether one night at <UNK> is a pretty cool film noir parody br br
<START> i just don't get it why call this a sequel to the film american werewolf when it has absolutely no connection with it whatsoever the first film was funny and scary with ground breaking special effects if memory serves the oscar category for special make up effects was created for this movie paris is none of these things awful effects and not much else do not see this movie rent the original werewolf in london instead you'll be much happier
<START> <UNK> to the <UNK> of post apocalyptic future films it is a <UNK> and very very intimate installment the most noticed element of the film is its silence no one speaks i don't think despite what is evident in most of his later work meant it as any kind of cool gimmick i think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of <UNK> everyone has to read each other based on <UNK> and conveying of emotion no matter how slight though i wasn't glued to the screen upon reflection i see that it's a very touching and sensitive perspective on human nature its vehicle is the stylized sci fi movie part of its reflection on the nature of the human world is that each of its humans is not necessarily played as a perfect human being the hero a lone drifter in the desolate new world is taken in by an older <UNK> who refuses to keep his part of an exchange of food between him and a <UNK> <UNK> character played by jean reno and so reno tries everything he can <UNK> using <UNK> force to get what he wants so the antagonist is right though not a good person and the protagonist and his sympathetic foil are both wrong though they are both good people br br it's shot in a clear and crisp black and white edited and captured in a low key yet <UNK> and small scale approach and its actors are very real how can they not be they like their characters are left with the bare <UNK> of communication this is one of the few truly good films that luc has written his earlier work is almost always better than the fluff he <UNK> out now
<START> this movie was so heart warming a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs it was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreams never give up <UNK> for the stand in
<START> please let me know of any versions of precious <UNK> or gone to earth on video that people may be aware of i love the books of mary <UNK> <UNK> and would be very grateful to have any information on either vhs or dvd br br i've read precious <UNK> and gone to earth which are my favorites by mary <UNK> many times and have <UNK> other novels by her also i was lucky to have found her springs of joy poetry and <UNK> but i've never been able to see the precious <UNK> version that was on masterpiece theatre or the full version of gone to earth although there was an american movie classic airing of the wild heart which was a chopped up version of gone to <UNK> original film br br if anyone can assist me in <UNK> copies of either or both of these films full versions i would be so thankful
<START> it's too kind to call this a <UNK> account of the barker gang they got the names right but that's about it br br russell is still hot i'll grant you that but this is not the real ma barker who basically took care of the boys by cooking and <UNK> when they moved around the country not by planning or <UNK> in the crimes i think it would have been far more interesting to present the real story of a middle aged woman caught up in the criminal activities of her children and their <UNK> br br i also have to agree with those reviewers who found the shoot out scenes to be totally unbelievable the barker victims were a combination of the innocent and of the law <UNK> agents who pursued them but they definitely did not <UNK> down half a dozen fbi agents every time they were <UNK> on the other hand as several recent books have related the fbi of that era <UNK> the idea of agents coming only from legal or <UNK> backgrounds to the extent that many agents had very little law <UNK> or <UNK> experience they were not the well trained agents that we picture today br br but the worst sin of all is that the movie is basically a bore nobody changes nobody grows we know the end of the road is ahead we just don't know which shoot out it will be br br only for die hard russell fans
<START> neil <UNK> takes a dramatic turn from his first two films in the company of men your friends and neighbors with this funny and original thriller comedy road movie when betty <UNK> witnesses the brutal murder of her no good husband aaron she develops a bizarre sort of <UNK> and <UNK> in his car not knowing that there is large <UNK> of drugs in the <UNK> morgan freeman and chris rock are the hit men who follow her br br what betty is chasing besides a new beginning although she can't remember the old life is her beloved dr david greg kinnear only problem dr david isn't real he's a soap opera character on the show a reason to <UNK> and he's really an <UNK> actor named george <UNK> br br to say any more regarding what develops would be too much but nurse betty is certainly original its hit men are like the hired killers of pulp fiction are violent yet philosophical its take on soap operas terrific spoof material and its acting is the best feature of all this has to be one of the best cast films in recent years <UNK> is perfect for nurse betty with the constant <UNK> in her eye that pushes her in her quest morgan freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career and chris rock is his partner a man of rage and great <UNK> greg kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actor soap opera doctor there are also great supporting performances from actors such as emmy winner allison the west wing harriet harris <UNK> agent <UNK> and kathleen chloe on er actually the supporting cast is a who's who of television best character actors br br a unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next nurse betty is a mix of great acting casting and a terrific screenplay
<START> a gritty presentation of the <UNK> of family values and human dignity in the wake of soviet communism 1988 film little vera is a landmark film of modern russian cinema brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of <UNK> <UNK> promoted in soviet times as in circus moving the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight a contemporary <UNK> setting further <UNK> the effect first by the <UNK> of the film to its time period second by its of a locale not only struggling for identity in <UNK> of a soviet system but also as a nation distinct from the russian <UNK> that had dominated the u s s r br br vera the film's title character and protagonist is a rebellious adolescent girl with a dysfunctional family including a hard drinking father and a mother care worn <UNK> her would be beau <UNK> vera begins a destructive and primarily sexual relationship with a college student named <UNK> despite her parents' dislike for the lazy <UNK> and despite rude contempt for her parents he moves into their <UNK> apartment tensions <UNK> until <UNK> father <UNK> stabs <UNK> vera must decide if she will stay loyal to her <UNK> family by <UNK> her father acted in self defense or continue to support and defend the ever detached <UNK> br br unbearable in almost every imaginable way little vera masterfully captures and <UNK> the <UNK> void left in social life after the collapse of communism the sexual <UNK> of the film it was the first film to show explicit sex combined with the <UNK> presentation of social reality a marked distinction from the <UNK> realism <UNK> by <UNK> effectively confronted the conditions of former soviet life most interesting however was public reception while many wrote hate mail to the director and star the film was wildly popular here the double edged nature of film as social criticism emerges if done correctly the film will make the audience uncomfortable because no easy solution presents itself some viewers will hate the film and filmmakers for bringing up the issue many films come to mind as somewhat comparable in this regard larry <UNK> kids harmony <UNK> <UNK> even popular movie's such as john <UNK> breakfast club br br i recommend this film to those viewers for whom the <UNK> of nearly two hours excruciating domestic conflict and social <UNK> is not overly <UNK> the film is absolutely beautiful and incredibly challenging despite the difficulties of watching the film some moments within it are profoundly beautiful of course the <UNK> historic and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked and in fact operate as an even more <UNK> reason for watching this film
<START> as i don't have a tv and had never heard of this mini series i didn't know what to expect from the second coming and hired it purely on the strength of its plot synopsis which sounded interesting br br dear god every pun intended if someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen year olds who had been given the project of turning the second coming into a school play i wouldn't have been surprised br br why oh why did they decide to portray jesus mark ii as what <UNK> to an idiot <UNK> is there anything in any of the <UNK> to suggest this okay an ordinary bloke but a great northern moron i don't think so br br apparently all jesus did to impress people was his <UNK> because according to this take his preaching sure as hell never impressed anyone certainly without the night into day stunt mr jesus <UNK> would have been <UNK> without a <UNK> a <UNK> or any kind of following at all br br and the odd little gay <UNK> put in willy <UNK> without rhyme or reason other than of course russell waving to his fan base jesus turns up in the pub to <UNK> more <UNK> northern losers and of course the gay writer's <UNK> the <UNK> woman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> away gay rights are <UNK> down his throat to no real purpose almost like russell thought he it to the to put jesus on the spot br br i can't really see the real jesus coming out with well i've nothing against it personally mate only someone truly middle class and <UNK> could imagine jesus to be quite this wet br br and don't start me on the ending come in and eat rat poison because the only way we can be truly free is if god br br it was like an eddie izzard sketch of god as bill gates hello i'm bill gates and now you've pointed out to me that my global <UNK> is <UNK> your style i'm going to give it all to you my customers and eat the rat poison of course br br i'm often <UNK> by the ratings on imdb but the high rating on this one takes the <UNK> br br never mind jesus for the new millennium this is jesus for brainless mtv <UNK> br br god help us all indeed
<START> everyone knows that late night movies aren't oscar <UNK> fine i mean i'll admit that i was a bit <UNK> and bored and figured i'd get to some skin a max it's pretty bad when the info on the tv guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description it even gave it half a star to be fair i did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was bad i couldn't stop laughing i mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious most of the time i think the people on the screen were trying their hardest to not to laugh in fact i think in one scene they did laugh anyways the movie didn't make sense it was like that one sopranos episode with the fat gay guy only the sopranos is great show but it was terrible i mean no nudity just sex scenes out of the 90's you know the kind that use shadows and <UNK> instead of flesh i gave it a two cause this flick makes for a good drinking game movie i mean with all the cheese it helps to get the wine out if its late at night and all that is on tv is this and that tony little guy and his exercise bike then i suggest tony little
<START> film follows a bunch of students in the nyc high school of the performing arts there's <UNK> irene <UNK> a black singer who will make it to the top despite everything she's helped by bruno lee a white musician then there's doris maureen who wants to be an actress but she's shy and scared she becomes friends with paul <UNK> the only gay student in the school and is <UNK> by <UNK> barry miller then there's <UNK> gene anthony ray who sadly died in 2003 who's homeless and a great dancer but can't read then there's various teachers albert <UNK> anne <UNK> stand out trying to teach the kids br br the songs are great the title tune and out here on my own were nominated for best song fame won the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent but this film misses the boat in the drama department many plot lines are brought up and completely left open ended by the end of the movie why did <UNK> do a porno did doris and <UNK> remain together <UNK> did either make it how about <UNK> what happened to him and did <UNK> ever graduate and how there are too many long speeches <UNK> has two and moments that just lead to nothing i'm assuming there were cuts in the script i can't believe the movie just left all this open br br still it's worth seeing for the acting and again the music there's basically not one bad song and the dances go full force and at one point stop traffic literally my favorites are fame out here and i sing the body electric which is a great closing song so i recommend it but can only give it a 7 the script really needed to tie up loose ends and it didn't br br trivia they wanted to shot this film at the actual school for performing arts but couldn't get <UNK> the dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film that is true there is a lot of foul language but that's how high school kids talk avoid the tv version which <UNK> <UNK> it
<START> because of the depth of his character studies and complexity of story lines james <UNK> works do not easily translate into film yet john huston in his last film before his death achieved a perfect translation of <UNK> story he received great support from his son as writer and daughter as actress
<START> i'm going to recommend putting this one in the skip it pile as well i was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancée rented it and a bit more excited when i saw that <UNK> <UNK> directed it ah well br br the costumes were nice sure but they were typical there was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the period costume department of any major hollywood studio there was no distinction between spanish british and french everyone dressed like they were at court in <UNK> the sets somehow didn't evoke the qualities of the settings the prison didn't feel like a prison the <UNK> didn't feel like <UNK> and the outside scenes looked like they were filmed on a back lot for all that they were probably practical locations br br the score was dramatically less than it could have been i have been a fan of film scores since my youth <UNK> <UNK> and collecting them by which i mean more than john williams my fiancée is a professional film composer an award winner who has had her works performed at lincoln center and a rising star in the industry at the start of the film we had high hopes for it and it did indeed start off nicely it rapidly <UNK> and at several points including the scene of the release of the prisoners it actually reached a level of annoyance i actually reached for the remote to turn down the volume the score was never anything more than the most obvious choice for <UNK> a specific tone of scene and didn't <UNK> itself into the soul of the film think of the music in <UNK> and you'll have an idea of what i mean it never <UNK> the <UNK> it wanted to but then neither did the film br br <UNK> <UNK> as talented as he is was awful for the first part of the film his mannerisms are so distracting that it takes over his performance during the second half everything that was his character in the first half is gone replaced by an entirely different set of annoying mannerisms and he looked like the love child of keith richards and stuart <UNK> i never got the idea that he cared about the role which is to say that the character cared about his life and actions or that the character was ever drawn by the writers as anything more than an <UNK> who for whatever reason changes his mind and decides to stick by his principles at the end br br natalie portman was very good although her performance lacked the shades of increasing insanity between her release from the prison and taking <UNK> hand at the end that i would have needed to call it truly an effective performance the character of alicia was never defined enough to truly <UNK> and if it weren't for the superb makeup on her eyes and <UNK> someone seeing the beginning of the film and the end wouldn't know they weren't the same character the <UNK> teeth were horrible artificial and distracting but that's no knock on ms portman br br <UNK> <UNK> was fine as <UNK> not oscar worthy but <UNK> and generally believable i don't know much about the life of <UNK> or his <UNK> but it seemed to be tacked on to the movie as a <UNK> of <UNK> information rather than anything that was <UNK> in the film i am sure it affected life much more than just <UNK> the need of an <UNK> but you'd never know it from watching this for the record words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted roughly 30 of the time through lip reading br br don't get me started on randy quaid at least he was a minor character br br the script reads like one of the choose your own adventure books i used to read as a kid at several moments through the film several <UNK> are possible and none of the actions <UNK> them lead with any <UNK> to the way the film actually plays out ironically the film is also predictable especially its <UNK> attempts at the mood through small bits of humor the joke about the hands maybe it's because i paint not well as a <UNK> and know what a pita hands are to draw paint but i saw the joke coming a mile away as well as the <UNK> in the second half was the baby ever there for any other reason other than to be taken by there might as well have been a line of bread <UNK> br br disappointing br br note this review is a copy of a <UNK> i made to a thread in the forum
<START> the late shift was an interesting made for hbo movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that <UNK> between david <UNK> and jay leno when johnny carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him this struggle is now part of hollywood <UNK> but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where <UNK> is now it might be interesting to learn that david <UNK> wanted to replace johnny carson as host of the tonight show more than anything in the world but <UNK> found his dreams being <UNK> as frequent guest host leno had one of hollywood's most powerful agents helen in his corner and working <UNK> to get her client the job it's not often that we get to see behind the scenes hollywood <UNK> <UNK> for entertainment value but for fans of these two late night <UNK> this movie provided a fascinating look at a very <UNK> period in late night television according to this movie <UNK> was practically promised the job by carson himself while nbc had promised the job to leno and that's where helen came in the movie presents leno as sort of a <UNK> who allowed his career to be manipulated by and <UNK> ignorance to some of <UNK> strong <UNK> <UNK> of some of <UNK> biggest power players and it presents <UNK> as this smart and <UNK> businessman who despite having <UNK> support was <UNK> by nbc and john michael <UNK> and daniel <UNK> <UNK> recreate <UNK> and leno respectively but it is the razor sharp performance of oscar winner kathy bates as helen that keeps this movie <UNK> bates <UNK> the screen in one of her best if not so well known performances as the <UNK> hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast there is also a wonderful turn by <UNK> rich little as johnny carson but it is primarily a fascinating story and the <UNK> performance by bates that make this one worth checking out
<START> i have searched for this movie for years i have great memories of the first rate acting and singing in this movie i never knew that the reason the movie was <UNK> was because of the actions of the gershwin family shame on them for trying to <UNK> at american classic i can only hope they will and allow this movie to be release and enjoyed by the american public br br sammy davis jr is at his absolute best in this film the only other performance of his this is it's equal was in another terrific film that i wish would be released on dvd br br <UNK> contained a first rate all star cast hopefully one day you'll get to see for yourself
<START> this movie is about london and it's an amazing movie it will be released on dvd in april 2003 and i will buy it when it gets out so if you have not seen it until then buy it the music in the movie is even better saint <UNK> have done the soundtrack
<START> i thought this to be a pretty good example of a better soft core <UNK> film it has a reasonable plot about the <UNK> of a <UNK> caught up in a police scheme to <UNK> a wealthy crook br br hardcore porn star chloe <UNK> again shows her genuine acting ability she will occasionally appear in soft core such as body of love and lady stories nicole on the other hand leaves something to be desired in her role as the female cop
<START> people please don't bother to watch this movie this movie is bad it's totally waste of time i don't see any point here it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again
<START> excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic cult ninja flicks of all time the plot being that this woman's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit i mean to be honest if i could obtain ninja ability through possession i would furthermore for being in the 80's and such the fact that the ninja aspect was far greater in this particular decade is evident and despite all that ninja 3 the <UNK> manages to keep it original from the american ninja cookie cutter <UNK> that plagued the 80's for so long this chick is definitely michael <UNK> on <UNK> i mean the first american ninja was great but let's get real folks it has nothing on ninja 3
<START> i rented this movie for about 1 50 the most complete waste of money and time i have ever spent it's lame i couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this br br the plot there is no plot everything you'd expect to happen it does only in a worse way the acting was horrible my dog could've done better the special effects have no effect whatsoever except inducing complete disbelief and the cheesy lines i mean why even bother br br the only credit i can give this piece of sh t are the opening scenes they were actually quite pretty and one of the reasons why i decided to rent this the graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic cg of the entire film br br total reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to mark it lower
<START> i've seen a lot of bad movies in my life date movie that was bad but this this is just it's not good house party 4 is the worst movie ever it's as simple as that it's basically <UNK> <UNK> with black people in it oh and it's not funny it's awful so awful chris may be a superstar on bet but he's an idiot he can't write a comedy or a horror movie i like to refer to him as a <UNK> lesser known uwe boll except uwe <UNK> films are funny awful if you know what i mean you can invite some buddies over pop in alone in the dark and have a great time laughing and eating <UNK> with your buddies chris is like that except if you invite friends over to watch house party 4 with you no one will be laughing not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock i'm serious i didn't laugh once throughout this whole movie the acting is terrible and the movie looks like a bad indie film what was the budget for this movie 5 damn dollars i mean what the hell this movie just sucks don't waste your time with this crap it's disgusting
<START> never having seen an oliver stone film before nor any films starring eric <UNK> i didn't know what to expect from this film having <UNK> with the idea of buying it for a while i finally got it for free as a <UNK> with a sunday newspaper and i was hugely impressed br br it tells the story of barry a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude towards his <UNK> often putting them in their place before they realise what's going on though this is what has made him a popular radio show host it has also earned him numerous enemies br br the acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it eric <UNK> is brilliant as barry the troubled talk radio host with alec baldwin turning in a strong performance as <UNK> boss dan it also features the voice of and cameo appearance by michael <UNK> my reason for wanting to see this br br the story was really well written as despite his arrogance you feel for barry as more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is br br i'd recommend this film to anyone as it is captivating and more importantly real on numerous levels two of which being that is was inspired by the life of an actual talk radio host and the fact that you do actually get radio show <UNK> and <UNK> like the ones featured in the film in reality br br high recommendation and 10 10 br br <UNK> yours cat <UNK>
<START> as many know this is the feature film debut of edward d wood jr as as a writer producer director actor i have been a fan of ed wood for several years now while i don't like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of wood during his life everybody knows that he was a <UNK> this film is about changing one's sex and how being a <UNK> can create conflict in relationships with loved ones this film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it however the film still contains <UNK> usual <UNK> of bad dialog meaningless stock footage and hokey special effects throw in <UNK> usual <UNK> of bela lugosi <UNK> it up and you have <UNK> first attempt at being a director br br the plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a <UNK> who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines the doctor tells him the story of <UNK> who is also a <UNK> <UNK> wants to marry barbara but can't bring himself to tell her about his secret he also tells the inspector about alan who <UNK> a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman bela lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on <UNK> part really isn't well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for wood to have a star in his film and lugosi to get some cash br br all in all the movie shows the <UNK> of <UNK> career it was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather <UNK> it definitely has the it's so bad it's good feel to it however i do have to applaud ed on his <UNK> thinking in making this film <UNK> and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays <UNK> as people who are not sexual <UNK> and putting a more human face on cross dressing
<START> writer director robert downey sr a <UNK> of the underground film movement in the 1960s <UNK> the new york madison <UNK> advertising world with his avant garde comedy downey doesn't <UNK> his <UNK> to advertising but <UNK> black <UNK> culture the dynamics in hollywood's portrayal of race the elite white power structure and character of corruption in any power struggle as <UNK> and ambitious as <UNK> to be it qualifies as a terrible film <UNK> made on a shoe string budget with a no name cast and humor that lacks hilarity everything about this movie <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and <UNK> culture like most marx brothers movies the plot is thin providing an excuse for <UNK> <UNK> gags most of which are terrible br br the <UNK> of a <UNK> madison <UNK> ad agency dies during a board meeting before the body has been removed the board holds a secret <UNK> vote to determine who will replace him each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member arnold johnson since none thought anybody would cast a <UNK> for him pink slips all but one of the white executives <UNK> himself with black pistol <UNK> employees and <UNK> the firm truth and soul advertising decides to alter the face of american advertising he refuses to accept <UNK> whose products are alcohol <UNK> or war toys <UNK> stage an <UNK> after he becomes the <UNK> and <UNK> a new line up of <UNK> that show up at his office <UNK> <UNK> of money and prepared to suffer abuse from <UNK> employees exploits his african american staff too <UNK> <UNK> their ideas after he fires them and <UNK> up a number of offensive advertising <UNK> all of which are <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> of marketing genius incredibly <UNK> proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government <UNK> who argue advertising tactics <UNK> a threat to the national security the high point of this black white 85 minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color unfortunately downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome the funniest part of involves our eponymous <UNK> <UNK> with u s president in washington d c <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> midget with a <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> larry wolf <UNK> tasteless jokes while trying to convince to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car the 6
<START> anyone that is looking for an episode of law and order or <UNK> would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or <UNK> work were totally ignored in this case br br a murder took place and all the police did was to grab a 15 year old boy off the street and take him to the only witness a <UNK> year old man and say is this the guy who did it sure the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently he must have <UNK> <UNK> his age by 5 10 years and changed clothes br br the police made absolutely no effort and they admitted it the did no <UNK> on any of the evidence they <UNK> no other witnesses and they beat a confession out of a 15 year old br br the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in florida let everyone now start talking about southern justice
<START> 15 park <UNK> is the address <UNK> is in search for from the movies beginning <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is extremely caring and loving half sister from mom's earlier marriage the movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a <UNK> patient the director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of through her continuous <UNK> to <UNK> and others br br <UNK> deserves not one but thousands of awards which i am sure she will be getting for this rendition of in this movie you can see the look of a patient written on her face by the <UNK> lips and sleepy eyes from the first scene itself <UNK> has done a good job but has been reduced to one half of the movie in spite of his importance in their life br br watch out for the intense relationships shown between the characters of the movie <UNK> <UNK> mom and between <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as usual has done a riveting performance to be remembered as the sister who sacrificed her life for br br the movie might not be your usual hindi <UNK> but can certainly make people look at the <UNK> patients in a different light altogether br br as usual <UNK> brings the movie to a different ending rather than any clichéd ones we might think off hats off to her for this great movie
<START> wow what can i say it was a good movie very different to all the boring remakes we see lately the only thing i would have liked to see a bit more of an ending like when jane left her husband im guessing she was going to <UNK> cause she fell for her not just her but everything that she is i so wish producers would actually show that sort of ending instead of leaving to it your imagination sort of ending i really hate it when they do that the <UNK> acts looked like fun but i guess you'd have to be light and i would like to see more movies like this one maybe the could do a sort of sequel of jane and <UNK> if i were in jane's shoes i would have went for the girl too she was attractive
<START> when <UNK> pierre or the <UNK> hit <UNK> in <UNK> his first <UNK> since <UNK> dick a year earlier the public response was similar to that found among the imdb reviews of x <UNK> even published <UNK> like <UNK> insane which of course he wasn't but when one <UNK> the writing styles found in <UNK> dick and pierre one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often <UNK> style found in the former clearly he was <UNK> the overly <UNK> style of the now forgotten victorian romances that were easily his immortal <UNK> dick he was not content however to turn out the sort of product that his <UNK> wanted and that surely would have sold his version of a victorian romance was a twisted cynical one perhaps but brilliant in its <UNK> the alternate title the <UNK> is quite appropriate as pierre <UNK> for and thinks he finds truth we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe as he <UNK> for happiness he becomes more and more miserable br br x is a fascinating adaptation of this novel set in modern or nearly modern france though in some ways it leaves little to the imagination and shows us <UNK> the incestuous relations that <UNK> could only hint at the <UNK> which make the novel and its message so <UNK> are perfectly in <UNK> the questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask yet the answers are left to the viewer br br i recommend a reading of the novel which is much shorter than <UNK> dick before seeing this movie i hope more people discover this <UNK> film
<START> great documentary of how <UNK> believed dinosaurs <UNK> captured with some of the most spectacular cgi since jurassic park done completely seriously like a <UNK> episode of nation <UNK> grabs your attention from the first frame and never lets go my favorite part was when the fights off the br br 10 stars this is what science is all about
<START> the limited scenery views were the only saving grace to an otherwise <UNK> and boring movie the acting was borderline absurd which i blame on the script and screenplay nicole <UNK> didn't look the part didn't act the part and was totally unconvincing as a mountain guide after watching this i was left with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie it must have been produced on a budget of pocket change the plot was thin at best and with the low caliber of acting at times it <UNK> the question to be asked why are we doing this i managed to sit through the entire movie but also asked myself why
<START> i have a little <UNK> of finding really cool <UNK> out there that are pretty much unknown and then letting people know about them this one is on top of my list for getting the word out this summer this indie film and i really mean indie not <UNK> fox <UNK> indie might be easy to overlook in the big <UNK> of celluloid but if you want something completely different you have to check this one out br br basically i thought it was totally great i should have known from the dvd cover front and back that this was going to be something totally different but they all say that their stuff is different to hook you well this one really is totally different it's in your face beautiful and scary and <UNK> to tell you to wake up war peace 9 11 poetry even a eerie sort of music video set to an old time patriotic song and a weird guy in an <UNK> need i say more just see it
<START> i originally saw this film while i was working as a musician doing musical theatre in summer stock if you've ever done any work in theatre especially at a summer stock theatre you'll really enjoy this film br br yes there are some moments of really bad writing in the film but overall it's a lovely tribute to the theatre and why people love it
<START> this is <UNK> this movie could of inspired paramount pictures to film the movie the core both movies have something in common nature the only improvement for <UNK> is a better cast cast is still good though excellent movie 8 out of 10 this is worth watching this movie does have truth to it heat waves are real another piece of truth is heat related power <UNK> where i live i have actually heard transformers blow <UNK> from heat is possible because people seeking to cool off may get <UNK> there is a considerable amount of team work in this movie again this a movie worth watching the movie has a good cast the movie has no slow spots
<START> this film is a very beautiful and slow film there is nothing hollywood about it it is very danish and the characters are very real it is the first danish film to take up this <UNK> theme it is really about love that has no gender i would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters the <UNK> <UNK> and charlotte are attracted to each other it is a story about love and life br br the story pretty much takes place in the two apartments there is almost no background music which makes it seem more real and intense the two actors playing the main characters are great they really make them seem real they are not <UNK> but real people you could meet in the street i think it is the first time i have seen a <UNK> portrayed this well very well done
<START> <UNK> la <UNK> this jackass spin off focuses on the obviously scripted adventures of <UNK> and his pals johnny <UNK> brandon etc this show while it has its fair share of gross out comedy and crazy stunts focuses mainly on torturing of his parents br br i'm sorry to say this <UNK> but you're in no way as cool as you think you are this ego <UNK> show is not only painfully unfunny and yes i liked jackass but also <UNK> beyond belief the overly stylized intro ends with <UNK> <UNK> explaining that he's going to do whatever the f he wants to how about you do something that is actually funny i liked jackass for what it was worth the camera work was horrible any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed br br not so with <UNK> la <UNK> we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and <UNK> his relatives but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile br br <UNK> la <UNK> is a poor spin off of that does little good but feed already too big ego i don't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone
<START> i enjoyed it there you go i said it again i even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it a couple of more times call me old fashioned but i prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america van damme moves well for a guy of his age <UNK> i think delivering kicks that reminds one of <UNK> if you like old school action and and explosions this is the movie to watch this is one of van <UNK> best works br br van damme and steven seagal movies get released <UNK> where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen
<START> this movie is one of the only historical documents displaying the talents of so many black singers actors actresses and dancers many who are no longer with us those which we are blessed to be able to enjoy today in 1999 through this film lets us recognize the talents that existed then this is why those individuals still living today as well those who are deceased are super star icons due to the educational history in music drama filming design singing etc this movie alone belongs to the people of this country br br i viewed this movie recently the sound was excellent the movie appeared to be complete color and clarity was fare but good considering how old this movie is without any <UNK> on frames i agree with all prior positive reviews i do not have any negative views br br i only would like to make one request please to whom it my concern please make this movie available so all can have this historical experience
<START> looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction you just found it this superb documentary about an aspiring feature filmmaker mark who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film i have ever seen probably because it's also one of the most tragic oddly enough the more i watch the film the more inspired i become
<START> about 12 minutes into the song in the scene where <UNK> hannah and <UNK> jr are first <UNK> there is a really pretty song playing what is that song and who is it sung by it's a song that sounds very romantic and it is a female singer piano playing etc i have tried everything in the world to look up the music on <UNK> and on <UNK> etc but it just doesn't come up not even on lyrics <UNK> so if you hear it i would sure love to know enough about it so that i can try to either go get the cd with that song on it or find it in <UNK> i don't know if my email will i am new at this but i will be looking back here
<START> <UNK> was awful this show was incredibly over hyped but this is nothing but a tedious bunch of anime clichés the characters are annoying and lifeless the story line is boring and endless i think that it could have be something interesting if it have a better writing but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in show <UNK> and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with and and a lot of circles around the same thing again and again the script is cheesy and dumb and the animation is poor the character design it 's very ugly i don't know why everyone love it all have the same face big eyes tiny <UNK> a line as the mouth and the typical anime <UNK> i find <UNK> incredibly boring and dumb this have to be one of the most over rated animated shows ever made
<START> sally and saint anne is a very funny movie the first time my mom told me about it i was 7 and saint anne had just been the saint i had for my <UNK> saint my mom knew this so she told me to watch this with her i did and have seen it many times since because it is really funny aunt <UNK> from the andy griffith show was in it and <UNK> grandfather was the guy who played santa claus in miracle on <UNK> street so there were lots of actors we seen on tv shows too there is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away and sally keeps trying things with st anne to help raise money so they can keep the house that includes a boxing match with hugh <UNK> who plays her older brother this is a good and funny movie that i still love
<START> this film is probably hal hartley's best one the subject of a unusual originality is treated that's usual with hal hartley with great humor this characteristic isn't at all the only quality of this film the <UNK> frame composition everything is parallel until the smallest details shooting angles lighting giving a more supernatural dimension to these <UNK> images <UNK> coming down couldn't be filmed in a conventional way the <UNK> <UNK> acting are qualities that make this bible re reading carried out in the form of an apocalyptic <UNK> essential
<START> this movie is called <UNK> kane which it isn't the main character wears a hat but that's all he has in common with robert <UNK> character <UNK> kane as known from early pulp magazines and lots of <UNK> ever since these days it is a fantasy movie not really that bad and it might easily have passed with a rather good review if it hadn't been called <UNK> kane the hero is a newly invented character who definitely is not the story is not robert howard neither br br as a fantasy movie it is one more movie following the traditions of the genre simple story poor cgi poor actors poor directing yet it can be fun you know 'the cheaper they are the better they <UNK> but since it is called <UNK> kane i cannot accept it imagine a lord of the rings movie with a hero <UNK> who fights the black <UNK> with the help of his dwarf friend <UNK> and the beautiful heroine and with a final fight where the three use a magical ring to kill the evil <UNK> who has transformed into the dragon imagine that this is exactly what this movie has done with robert <UNK> character <UNK> kane br br i'd give it a 4 stars review if it was just another horror movie but since it is called <UNK> kane i can only rate it 3 stars
<START> i watched this years ago on television when i was sick i don't know i tend to be more <UNK> with my tv viewing when i'm sick too much effort to use the remote control i guess br br from what i can recall every aspect of the movie casting acting writing directing etc was ill advised at best i could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if this film had created a sense of what it was like to work on <UNK> but it didn't there were attempts to <UNK> the scientists but they were <UNK> and never <UNK> caricature br br i didn't know very much about the people involved in the manhattan project at the time but the portrayals in the movie were so cartoonish that i became interested in learning about the real personalities and i did so i guess this horrible film has done a very small amount of good after all br br this is not an in depth review but neither deserves nor requires one you might enjoy it if you're a fan of bad movies
<START> h o t s is proof that at one time the movie industry said f off to the censors and made movies with whatever they wanted in today's world this movie would be too over the top and extreme for it to be anywhere than behind a <UNK> curtain although had several copies on their 5 99 rack in case anyone wanted to get a copy the movie was brilliant in its own way in that it <UNK> humor into a t a movie loaded with playboy <UNK> unlike most skin flicks it did have a plot that however is not exactly why you would watch h o t s br br h o t s is a college movie that reminds me of the revenge of the <UNK> movies in that it takes a group of average people and puts them against the elite rich <UNK> that most people can't stand the only difference is that the <UNK> in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid i notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low and to me that is ignorant obviously this is not intended to win oscars or break <UNK> in film if you are looking for that then go watch what ever the critics pick for you you have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot decent acting for the most part given the genre and plenty of girls getting naked h o t s is one of those movies you watch to get your mind off of modern day problems and daily stress and instead laugh and have a good time if you are looking for a funny college based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink straight then you should really check out h o t s
<START> being a wallace and <UNK> fan i was looking forward for this full length movie surprisingly i saw it at the world premiere in <UNK> <UNK> at the film by the sea festival a wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie it's about wallace and <UNK> whom i believe don't need an introduction having their own <UNK> control company in the city which is <UNK> a giant <UNK> contest in a few days everyone including an eccentric <UNK> is hoping his or her giant <UNK> or <UNK> will win the golden <UNK> unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry <UNK> this is where w g come in the have their own cracking <UNK> to control these cute creatures in a human way br br it's a very funny and colorful story anyone who liked the three <UNK> short movies of w g which are more than great will love this full length movie nick park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor like in chicken run it truly <UNK> me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames job well done <UNK> oh yeah the music was fantastic it really <UNK> the ride enjoy
<START> this movie as the 1st movie should be active to their people and show the good thing on them otherwise we see in this as cast want show <UNK> people in <UNK> <UNK> as terrorist and stupid in fact their not they are very peaceful and smart about the director is not even less good the grandfather in movie is very younger than the father everyone notes that and the girls who not <UNK> by the way show our girls as <UNK> looking to man to satisfy their needs was just another part of furniture at act he did nothing to imagine only when he said to his lover i love you and yell to his friend don't talk to strange girls really funny or really stupid br br the father was so not moving only set their and he watch this movie as not one of cast and only word he said al the weird thing in this movie is when the girls were set in restaurant in family's part there voice in behind young man talk to his girlfriends kiss me many times is that happened in <UNK> <UNK> when the girls and boys grow up good and not <UNK> and <UNK> any <UNK> have <UNK> in his heart will not allow to see this stupid movie
<START> for me this is not a good tv show animated or otherwise it is however annoying to the <UNK> degree there are a few reasons for this in no particular order first the intro of one of the most pointless and annoying characters ever <UNK> this character serves no purpose for the show whatsoever maybe it is intended as comic relief but it doesn't work out that way next up the joker i thought it was really ridiculous to have his character let loose with that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence talk about repetitive this gets old really fast also don't think the had the right actor to voice the character it just doesn't sound at all like the joker should sound lastly they made robin look like a complete <UNK> other than these problems the show isn't that bad but these are big enough problems to drastically lower the <UNK> factor for me the new adventures of batman is a 3 10 at best
<START> extraordinary rendition is a frightening practice <UNK> surprisingly under <UNK> that allows the u s government to <UNK> and hold anyone suspected seemingly for any reason of being a terrorist against the united states this is a <UNK> issue especially after 9 11 because supporters of the practice will always criticize the opposition as <UNK> vital power from the u s that it needs to effectively fight terror fanatic supporters will label the opposition as terrorists in themselves br br but like a recent film that <UNK> a similar level of humanity to the death penalty the life of david <UNK> rendition shows us a story of the <UNK> of extraordinary rendition or at least the ease with which it can be exploited and <UNK> applied the story involves <UNK> el an american chemical engineer born in egypt who is <UNK> on his way back to america from giving a lecture in egypt the cause given is that he made phone calls to a known terrorist no proof is ever given or needed that it was <UNK> that made the calls that his phone was never lost of stolen br br meanwhile extremely pregnant wife <UNK> is back in the states <UNK> trying to find her husband who got onto a plane to chicago but apparently never got off the flimsy explanation that he was never there <UNK> when she discovers that he made an in flight purchase using his credit card br br lately i have been <UNK> modern chinese history particularly that of the astonishingly selfish and brutal <UNK> set up by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and it is more than a little frightening to see the similarities between extraordinary rendition and some of brutal scare tactics including his public <UNK> which the people were forced to watch and extensive use of torture specifically used to <UNK> <UNK> br br it is pretty disturbing to notice that <UNK> specifically did these things to create an environment of fear in order to achieve <UNK> from the chinese people to say that the bush administration has not created an environment of fear and continues to milk it for everything it's worth would be <UNK> in the extreme and although extraordinary rendition was not created under bush it is clear that it does more harm than good br br adding to the <UNK> of the film is douglas freeman jake <UNK> who works behind a desk for the cia and has little field experience until his boss is <UNK> and he suddenly finds himself <UNK> the torture of a man that he quickly comes to doubt has anything to reveal <UNK> boss daughter also plays a pivotal role as does a <UNK> played by peter <UNK> who might have the most satisfying role in the movie meryl streep is also suitably cold and <UNK> as a <UNK> senator with a <UNK> support of the necessity and practice of rendition br br as a political thriller the movie is remarkably well crafted and paced but the scariest thing about it is that this is all real the movie's goal is to get people to really think about the things done in america's name especially when they claim to be done to prevent those same things <UNK> terror in the name of <UNK> terror will win no sympathy for us nor will <UNK> <UNK> through brutal torture which is the <UNK> form of criminal investigation br br unfortunately we are gradually heading in that direction of doing these things more rather than less the frightening question is what is the event that is going to take place at some point in the future to convince us to stop and head the other way toward civilization and peace or will we just keep heading toward a military <UNK> until we finally get there
<START> <UNK> d in the pick of destiny tells the fictional tale of the <UNK> of the band <UNK> d and their quest to find the pick of destiny a guitar pick with supernatural powers made from the tooth of satan himself played by dave <UNK> jack black and kyle <UNK> joined together by fate must travel to the rock <UNK> roll museum and steal the pick of destiny to become the greatest band on earth the movie is hilarious and delivers non stop laughs jack black and kyle <UNK> work perfectly together having been real life friends and co workers for over 20 years the film is in part a musical all or most of the music was written and performed by the d all of the songs are new material and many of them are classic the soundtrack is definitely worth checking out this film will be mostly appreciated by fans of <UNK> d but if you are not a fan of the d i still think you will enjoy the movie if you are a fan of the d then you must see this movie the acting isn't as bad as you may think and the laughs and <UNK> never stop coming i highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their <UNK> <UNK> off and laugh as hard as they have laughed in a long time look out for cameos by dave <UNK> james <UNK> <UNK> ben stiller amy <UNK> tim robbins john c <UNK> and neil <UNK> also stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits
<START> incident on and off a mountain road is don entry in mick <UNK> masters of horror series <UNK> is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the phantasm series and the <UNK> weird <UNK> ho <UNK> but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this tv episode the plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman this time it's a young woman driving down a mountain road after a head on crash she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac the whole chase sequence is really ridiculous with the young lady stopping every so often to set traps only for the maniac to show up seconds later and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband who just happens to have a wealth of information on how escape insane killers with lines such as expect the unexpected the only real highlight for me was the presence of tall man <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tries his best to <UNK> as much horror imagery as possible with things such as a <UNK> corpse of a dead baby but because it's all so silly on the whole it's difficult to take this piece seriously this is the first episode in the series and the first that i've seen i really hope they get better
<START> the 1994 film production of heart of darkness was in no way capable of living up to the outstanding book the film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than <UNK> them in understanding what was going on the director was obviously not experienced and if he is then he didn't show it on top of that scenes from the book were left out or changed scenes that were rather important the movie left me feeling rather bored and was a complete waste of my time the characters acted as though they had no idea what was going on and the actors did not portray the emotions that <UNK> and the rest revealed in the book overall the movie was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that was otherwise necessary to make it even remotely interesting
<START> br br summary not worth the film br br as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters <UNK> on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret <UNK> book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape <UNK> murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband <UNK> butler to <UNK> under the <UNK> of visiting extended family after coming to an <UNK> with <UNK> she agrees to leave and proceeds to <UNK> with her o'hara relatives in <UNK> eventually she <UNK> her cousin a passionate leader of the <UNK> to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett <UNK> out into the world of the english <UNK> and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been <UNK> by <UNK> time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of <UNK> until <UNK> comes along in a clichéd night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancé and <UNK> by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i <UNK> advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to <UNK> this decision br br
<START> james l <UNK> is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life he isn't only the producer for the simpsons he has some classic comedies under his belt broadcast news is one of them br br although it doesn't match his later effort as good as it gets broadcast news is still a very clever funny and witty movie about a television <UNK> station and all the problems they suffer there's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where joan cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on tv br br this isn't only very truthful in terms of how <UNK> <UNK> stations are <UNK> but also a <UNK> and honest portrayal of human beings br br a low key subtle movie with good acting especially from hurt who i don't always like so much and apt direction
<START> this is a stupid movie like a lot of these karate movies it is badly written awkward and sometimes just stupid the action really isn't all there and the movie overall leaves much to be desired everyone here is talking <UNK> doing bad karate and doing a very bad job of acting br br watch for <UNK> <UNK> in a small role he is too good for this movie overall jim kelly is good at karate but he is a terrible actor gloria <UNK> is real bad all of them are there are just so many parts to this film that make absolutely no sense the supposed love running away scene with <UNK> and kelly what the hell was that they destroyed that man's guitar for no reason br br and then there was the mandatory girls on now what was that they were in the movie for five seconds then you never heard from them again then there is the whole <UNK> charged element of the movie which is cool and all but in this movie it goes absolutely nowhere like i said this is good for a laugh one time but don't watch it again
<START> i can't get over how lazy the director is with this movie instead of setting up scenes in a creative way he relies on boring old zombie clichés br br where the two <UNK> leads have to get down the college steps into the van he <UNK> them with zombies yet neither of the leads is bitten he can't be bothered to direct a decent fight scene so we see the leads <UNK> their way down the steps br br sometimes the zombies limp about and at others they run like the wind this is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything he likes without bothering with continuity in the behaviour of the zombies br br with careful planning and a lot more inspiration this movie could have been so much better
<START> i absolutely hated this movie even though the movie wanted to <UNK> some kind of social message it was done in such a cliché ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap opera br br also the acting was terrible especially and her son that's one of the problems with <UNK> movies they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses br br i'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means <UNK> are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality
<START> writer director brian burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies and he seems to think that he's discovered the formula for success plenty of location shots in new york preferably in the winter <UNK> to old hollywood films especially musicals enjoyable musical soundtrack alas all of this is mere <UNK> for <UNK> lack of talent as a writer the great mystery of many writer directors making independent films is not why they cannot get on with major studios but how they get any backing at all for their films br br normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the lead characters but the couple in this film simply has no appeal this is not the fault of either david or <UNK> their characters are just poorly written what we respond to in such classics as when harry met sally or annie hall or older films such as his girl friday are quirks and flaws of the lead characters' personalities lacking the ability to create individuals burns gives us an after school special inspired by men are from mars women are from <UNK> br br how anyone can see burns as the <UNK> to woody allen is beyond me i did not laugh once during this film and the screen play is full of echo chamber dialog i want to paint the town red you want to paint the town red which is the most tell tale sign of someone who has no business writing for a living in one of the early scenes we see actress girlfriend filming a mindless tv sitcom it's the only moment in the whole film that the dialog feels right maybe that <UNK> what burns talents are really suited for
<START> great another foreign film that thinks it's fellini on top of that we have to have more propaganda about murdering disabled people br br i see no reason why we have to be <UNK> with these <UNK> disguised <UNK> commercials br br i found nothing redeeming about this film what can be redeeming about a man without the courage to carry on in spite of some <UNK> it does not take courage to commit suicide that is the action of a coward sharing this wish with his woman simply <UNK> her with the same illness he has if this had been a film about a man's courage to go on in spite of his problems similar to the jill <UNK> story that would have made it a great film br br if you're interested in seeing true courage check out the movies about jill <UNK> the former <UNK> who was disabled after a bad <UNK> accident
<START> my comment is mainly a comment on the first <UNK> the extra on the film and his unhappy <UNK> of the film i think his perspective <UNK> why an extra is an extra and a director is a director the film was sweet the acting sufficient the experience of watching it a nice <UNK> from a busy work week it wasn't the hours acting or the matrix special effects or even the color purple direction most movies won't be but it also wasn't the crap fest that <UNK> would lead you to believe sorry guy just my 2 cents br br as to the movie itself it was in the end very gay <UNK> 1 it showed a world full of diverse and less than perfect people you know just like <UNK> 2 it opened a door on one culture without <UNK> other cultures 3 and i liked the music 4
<START> this timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated i can't even count how many times i've seen dirty dancing this is one movie that i could probably watch every few weeks and still love br br there is something timeless about this movie i have loved other blockbuster love story movies like pretty woman and when harry met sally i think their up there but there is something about dirty dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect the characters the chemistry between and grey the movie's direction the incredible dancing the warm <UNK> atmosphere everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect it is an instant classic and i've never really seen a movie like it either before or since br br i don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers dirty dancing has a nostalgic <UNK> <UNK> mood realistic characters a honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us br br this movie is always on tv and i will continue to watch it as long as they show it but i will mention i have no interest in seeing nights this one they should have left alone
<START> when i put this movie in my dvd player and sat down with a coke and some <UNK> i had some expectations i was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strong points of the first movie <UNK> animation good flowing story excellent voice cast funny comedy and a kick ass soundtrack but to my disappointment not any of this is to be found in atlantis <UNK> return had i read some reviews first i might not have been so let down the following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned br br when the first scene appears your in for a shock if you just picked atlantis <UNK> return from the display case at your local or whatever and had the expectations i had the music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one with the exception of a few characters like the voice of sweet the actual drawings <UNK> that bad but the animation in particular is a sad sight the storyline is also pretty weak as its more like three episodes of doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time but dont <UNK> it's not very good doo episodes i didnt laugh a single time although i might have once or twice br br to the audience who haven't seen the first movie or don't especially care for a similar sequel here is a fast review of this movie as a stand alone product if you liked doo you might like this movie if you didn't you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do and i suspect it might be a good kids movie but i wouldn't know it might have been better if <UNK> return had been a three episode series on a cartoon channel or on breakfast tv
<START> sometimes intentionally campy at other times unintentionally silly like in the opening scene where a woman is informed that she has been raped and that her family has been slaughtered just for the sake of exposition this film is ultimately neither funny enough nor competent enough as a straightforward adventure story to be really enjoyable i'll leave you to decide which may be the highlight but the low point is probably the fight with a silly <UNK> dragon <UNK> <UNK> was a good choice for <UNK> with her fresh face and her firm slightly muscular body and i think that her dark red hair suits her perfectly but <UNK> gives one of his few <UNK> performances as 1 2
<START> containing <UNK> famous humor this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure pleasantly unexpectedly so for billy crystal this movie has different tear <UNK> dramatic serious underlying themes particularly with a scene with steven seagal this movie was both entertaining and serious a movie about lost love about relationships with father son husband wife about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in especially at the beginning the balance between drama and comedy isn't always <UNK> as with the new classical genre of this type but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid the discovery of billy <UNK> talent <UNK> agent character in romania of a giant human is revealing and the behind the <UNK> view of movie agent is fascinating yet the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about one's self eight out of ten stars
<START> <UNK> and woody are married but they're poor they meet robert redford and he's really rich he takes a fancy to <UNK> and since he's a gambling man he makes the couple an <UNK> <UNK> one million dollars for a night with the little woman br br at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep of course <UNK> is going to accept the offer if she doesn't there's no first half of the movie of course it will affect <UNK> and <UNK> marriage if it doesn't there's no second half of the movie and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll if it doesn't there's no happy ending for the sake of box office br br the absolute best thing you can say about <UNK> <UNK> is that <UNK> moore looks good in a black dress as for the rest the script is incompetent the direction amateurish the performances <UNK> i suspect redford moore and <UNK> <UNK> and change the subject every time the film is mentioned do them and more importantly yourself a favor unless some one offers you a million miss it br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> the director of this movie is a famous french tv <UNK> patrick <UNK> he likes music and humor for <UNK> and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image it's the story of a young retarded person called <UNK> a night he sees his sister's <UNK> sexual relation and decide to do the same thing he rape the girl who he loves is placed in a asylum and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic one man will find them one man will reunite them this man is a psychologist this man looks like a <UNK> angel this man is patrick <UNK> with an excessive use of clichés we'll see how the absolute love can break all <UNK> and how a <UNK> doctor can force a victim to fall in love with her rapist we'll also learn how using <UNK> in order to seduce a girl not only patrick <UNK> thinks that he can do better than one century of <UNK> but he also <UNK> us a silly left ideology with the character of the father's girlfriend a boss who want to take away the feeble of his girl <UNK> but it's very pleasant to laugh at mentally retarded persons are not funny except in this movie
<START> i'm glad i read the sarah waters novel first since i had my own pictures of the characters in my head at the time the ones cast for this production however were not at all disappointing in fact after i got used to <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> i think nina gold did a damn fine job in the casting department can <UNK> be more delicious br br the bbc has done it again this is a wonderful production of a very good book and they have done it up in style if you can get your hands on this vhs dvd be sure to get the minute version the <UNK> one it is a marvelous journey albeit a bit rocky at times that you won't regret taking
<START> i actually own this movie which is the mst3k version called cave <UNK> which is really the only way anyone could really watch a movie like this if it weren't for joel crow and tom <UNK> constantly making <UNK> it wouldn't be possible to sit through this piece of crap you have a hero called <UNK> who looks a lot like jeff in fast times at <UNK> high and appears only slightly more intelligent just without being stoned he takes on <UNK> the cave <UNK> invisible guys a giant snake with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> snakes that like to line up all the <UNK> to face the same way <UNK> a hang <UNK> which <UNK> looks like a modern <UNK> one with some cheap <UNK> wrapped around it and then does battle with the evil john <UNK> looking dude then he rides off on his horse across the tire tracks where someone's been four <UNK> br br yes i got most of that from mst3k which as i said is the only way to watch this turkey of a movie if it weren't for that it would get zero stars
<START> this film is a masterpiece it was <UNK> from beginning to end writer director paul thomas <UNK> story about a porn star is told with style grace humor even <UNK> the actors and the characters they play are all first rate including mark <UNK> in the lead who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film burt reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers <UNK> the film <UNK> the late 70s and early 80s with dead on accuracy from the disco scene that begins the film to <UNK> don johnson miami vice outfit that he wears in the final scene most regular <UNK> who see this film will no doubt compare it to pulp fiction but it really has much more in common with the films of robert altman and martin scorsese the film is a triumph in style the opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in the player and absolute <UNK> the editing by dylan is simply phenomenal i couldn't believe the editing didn't receive an oscar nomination good will hunting was a better edited film the best scene in the film has to be the one with the <UNK> i had <UNK> in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense when i saw the film a second time i had the exact same reaction to the scene unfortunately it may not have the same impact on tv as it did in a theater with good <UNK> sound it's a shame that many people didn't see this movie during its theatrical run because it is the best way to watch it <UNK> use of widescreen will suffer on tv so get the dvd or a <UNK> tape it is amazing how easy anderson makes it all look because this is only his second film the music sets costumes photography offbeat characters sex violence happiness and <UNK> are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking
<START> <UNK> force 1986 wasn't as good as dr <UNK> and it wasn't as good as the bridge on the river <UNK> heck it wasn't even as good as g i jane which is pretty sad br br the film revolves around a basic <UNK> problem in a <UNK> prisoner of war situation how far can you go before you start breaking the law what exactly is the law in such a situation how can you <UNK> the torture of someone without actually torturing someone can you intentionally <UNK> pain how about breaking bones mock <UNK> sexual abuse severe blood loss real guns with bullets death somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line <UNK> acceptable from atrocious br br now what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between <UNK> and reality begin to <UNK> what could you do this movie attempts to portray this dilemma br br i found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in resistance training i have a brother who went through the <UNK> training program according to him it was pretty close to the mark technically br br the film has a fairly good premise but it doesn't have a particularly good story i wondered if it might be based on some actual event but it became pretty apparent that it wasn't when the explosions started they must have changed <UNK> three quarters into the film because it takes a real extreme turn and <UNK> into a somewhat pointless shoot em up with lots of distracting explosions br br i found it to have a rather unsatisfying ending again kind of pointless i'm left wondering what the point of the whole thing was i'm beginning to suspect there simply wasn't one it could have been much better with just a little more story to go along with the fireworks
<START> this movie was dreadful <UNK> very inaccurate <UNK> was 80 years old when he led the people out of egypt the movie has him about forty <UNK> was about forty when he <UNK> egypt was gone for forty years and was with them wandering for forty years <UNK> was <UNK> years old when he died and was denied the <UNK> of crossing over to the promised land i realize movies use a lot of poetic license as the biblical account isn't that long but if making a biblical movie they still need to reflect the facts known and keep the general flavor of the main biblical character this movie fails in this aspect and in many others even though the 1956 version has its problems as well <UNK> it was much better
<START> hilarious show with so many great stories that it reflects the world today as we know it in such a funny way it literally stole my <UNK> for other shows i laughed so hard that i just found any other comedy shows unfunny the unique <UNK> of each characters is a great original technique that just makes the show funny and very humorous you may think that this is an average comedy show about hard life with a family that's what i thought at first but i found out that it holds new and unique techniques that completely sets it apart from any other average comedy show michael <UNK> is a star i sure wish that this show wasn't canceled
<START> it's dreadful rubbish i liked <UNK> do you want <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and bill <UNK> <UNK> act but i file this with <UNK> and of the <UNK> the re imagining under <UNK> <UNK> went badly <UNK> my guess is that it appeals to the same people who like and <UNK> it's <UNK> but to little end a ish air <UNK> it and bernard black is simply a less camp <UNK> and i thought it was self indulgent even before dylan <UNK> became the writer but the set up such comic potential that for the first 2 i didn't even notice that it wasn't in the slightest bit <UNK> worthy br br the things they are saying doing should be funny but somehow they don't manage to register as more than mildly amusing or i can see how someone writing this down might have thought that this would be funny what i am trying to say is that the situations remarks are mildly humorous and yet too mundane gentle self <UNK> surreal to be worth creating for and depicting in a sitcom br br life is too short avoid
<START> i can't disagree with a previous comment that driving lessons is more than a little <UNK> but one man's <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> i suppose in my book this film succeeds on pure charm no small feat in itself br br i can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway julie dame is a <UNK> over the top and over the hill actress though hasn't had steady work in years it's unclear the last time she visited reality if ever think <UNK> from at <UNK> at one point she is even forced to come to grips with her <UNK> factor some may find her annoying but i think that's the point to emphasize just how much she pushes the reserved ben's rupert buttons to force him out of his shell ben is equally isolated from reality living his whole life under the thumb of his overly <UNK> mother who laura <UNK> manages to breath some life into despite being a fairly one dimensional character <UNK> <UNK> overbearing religious mom i was rather impressed with rupert who i found to give a very honest and believable performance not to mention sweet as all get out i can't think of many teen actors today for whom i can say that br br the heart of the movie is what happens when ben and worlds <UNK> at first ben is understandably <UNK> but also intrigued as is essentially the exact opposite of everything he's ever known with the combination of <UNK> and ben's helpful nature a genuine <UNK> develops between them culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives ben his first real taste of independence br br the tone is consistently light even through a few brief melodramatic bits but there was still a surprising amount of emotional <UNK> a credit to the main actors all in all i'd say that if you're willing to sit back and let yourself be <UNK> by some lovely performances driving lessons shouldn't disappoint however if cute is not in your movie <UNK> best to stay away br br one other minor note the soundtrack features the music of stevens <UNK> a nice touch
<START> i had no idea who bruce <UNK> was before seeing this film i had just seen the <UNK> doc which was alright the only problem was <UNK> led a very content life and the doc was well content <UNK> story is filled with all the <UNK> tragedy people buy into these days but it carries a great deal of heart with it though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much one can sense that bruce accepted the price of making music his way there are so many elements that make up his legacy ie invention of the where bruce could actually play music by touching people it must have been challenging to document <UNK> <UNK> which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable even rap music but the director cut the piece together very <UNK> and managed to capture the spirit and the cast what a group of characters bruce surrounded himself with but what do you expect from a <UNK> guru <UNK> with kids fighting against the music industry i recommend this film to anyone interested in music history it's that mainstream but that important
<START> happy days was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974 but the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by <UNK> this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of american br br there were some similarities between american and happy days br br both opened with rock around the clock by bill <UNK> the both took place in a <UNK> era and both featured ron howard as one of the leading roles but there were also some major differences while american took place in <UNK> california and centered around a group of newly <UNK> high school students about to take that big step into <UNK> happy days took place in and centered around a group of teenagers in high school dealing with the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> br br happy days originally opened with the <UNK> box playing the original version of bill <UNK> the rock around the clock but when <UNK> became hot thanks to the success of american and the original 1954 version of rock around the clock entered the <UNK> hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974 <UNK> <UNK> went through the roof so a remake of the song the correct term is now new <UNK> recording was quickly <UNK> br br the current theme song for happy days was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right br br fans and <UNK> alike agree that this show is <UNK> liberties were taken and details overlooked making this show less than completely authentic br br this is perfectly fine happy days is supposed to be a comedy not a history lesson but occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their <UNK> out by hitting on controversial topics one episode centered around the <UNK> building of a fall out shelter another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life the topic of prejudice was addressed when howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black in an era when prejudice and <UNK> was sadly an acceptable part of the american way of life the issue of the draft even came up on a later episode br br the show as originally set in 1955 one problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast most of them were teenagers and as each year passed it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast moving the series out of the safe waters of the <UNK> years into the age of <UNK> all the way with <UNK> and then into the <UNK> later half of the 1960s that along with the writers running out of ideas and later cast members like ron howard leaving the series wisely <UNK> while they were ahead left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and <UNK> while they were ahead that along with the idol <UNK> studio audience who just couldn't control themselves every time the great <UNK> entered the scene began to wear very thin very fast br br this show originally portrayed the fabulous fifties as we like to remember that era time <UNK> wounds you know everything has its place and though i would prefer hearing the original hit versions over those new <UNK> <UNK> those new <UNK> <UNK> worked very well on happy days and this is where i find myself <UNK> my buying the dvd unlike the complete first season dvd the original music on the complete second season has been replaced with different music while it is great that the original episodes were <UNK> restored to digital perfection the <UNK> of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch
<START> the only good thing that this movie created was that it made me hungry for ice cream minus the dead body parts in it the movie is one of the most cheesy i've seen in a long time when the ice cream king dies in the beginning i was laughing so hard because the kid took the ice cream from him and started eating it his mom asked him to say something and should should have said leave me alone and let me eat the free ice cream so i can watch my acting career go down the drain at a young age that seems about right for a line then i wondered why the ice cream prince was behind the bars of his ice cream truck was someone going to rob him of his twenty cents i've never seen bars on a ice cream truck window it seemed pretty stupid you might as well forget about the acting because it is just awful forget about this movie and go down to <UNK> queen and get an ice cream
<START> this movie is very bad in fact the only reason why i've given it a 2 rather than a 1 is because it made me laugh without giving anything away a man's head actually explodes in this film it was so pathetic i laughed i don't believe the scene was meant to be funny but it's nonsense complete nonsense the original halloween is such a good film it's a shame they had to go and make such a stinker
<START> if this movie was made two years earlier it could have been a lot better but unfortunately it was made in the decade that had no idea about how a horror movie was supposed to look or act when i first heard about this movie people on imdb were it as the sequel to <UNK> camp oh how wrong they were yes <UNK> russell was in it but uma thurman sure wasn't i'd really like to find the person who started that whole sequel <UNK> i'm sure a lot of us would though i'm not gonna give anything away because frankly i don't remember how this movie even ends i'm just gonna tell you to watch a real camp horror movie the burning starring jason alexander fisher stevens holly hunter the geek from fast times at <UNK> high a word to the wise just because a horror movie has the word camp in the title doesn't mean its gonna be worth watching oh and another thing any horror flick made in the early to mid 90's was ever considered even remotely good
<START> i guess i wasn't sure to what to expect from this film it had a good cast an interesting story line and a bunch of other things going for it but i still couldn't shake a feeling of dread that i had in my stomach about what it would be like i am glad to say that i was very pleased with the result and regret worrying about it all along the films opening scenes were extremely intriguing and were enough to sustain early interest in the film as the film progressed we were introduced to the characters of the film as well as what happened in the prison <UNK> like most reviews for this film i have to admit that there is some cliches but it can't <UNK> the overall power of this film that reads like a good novel the cast are all great particularly <UNK> and and the film ranks as one of the better made for tv films of this year certainly worth watching if you are looking for a good courtroom drama
<START> this film was a surprise the plot synopsis sounds kinky and stars clint eastwood and the great <UNK> page i didn't know what to expect there is that opening scene where the wounded soldier says that age 12 is old enough to kiss and proceeds to give a child a lingering and very adult mouth to mouth kiss the child takes him to the girls <UNK> school where she lives he takes advantage of the situation by attempting to seduce the <UNK> played by page her assistant and another student jealousy sexual tension incest intrigue and the macabre all <UNK> in this wonderfully original story br br i've read the other comments here and find little to disagree with however i wanted to <UNK> a point made earlier that there are no sympathetic characters in the film i find that there is one the attractive female slave successfully <UNK> the <UNK> advances in a scene that works well because it touches upon the common history of black women slaves taken advantage of by white men even though her strength and lack of illusion are the sum total of her experience she is what i would consider a sympathetic character she more than any of the other women and girls at the school has a legitimate reason for <UNK> in what happens in the end
<START> i don't even know where to begin br br it's is not worth <UNK> a review so i will just quote what another user posted because i agree thoroughly but i give it 1 10 instead of 2 10 i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was the initial <UNK> was promising but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful let's run through the main points plot good initial idea but truly terrible development there were many points when i thought no nobody would do something that stupid the ending was amazingly <UNK> characterisation all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures i keep trying to think of one that wasn't possibly the mother but that's it music <UNK> inappropriate and generally terrible direction totally amateurish cinematography doubt they've heard of it camera angles <UNK> zoom levels often really bad i am totally <UNK> at how this film has scored so highly it's the worst movie i've seen at the cinema for years if not ever
<START> this film is good but not <UNK> s best my favourite is <UNK> and <UNK> but this is a sad and very nice film kris is good in this movie and really makes a difference i am going to miss <UNK> and this is his last film br br a good film by a great director 7 5 10
<START> looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex this is the first in an impressive string of <UNK> from producer or in this case director geoffrey reeve br br and it's a <UNK> laughable on just about every level br br some government agents i think are <UNK> murdered in <UNK> and a considerably less than charismatic block of wood <UNK> agent who i assure you is not named louis is sent in to investigate by walking around a lot to ensure the tax dodge <UNK> get their <UNK> worth for the plane tickets to shoot on location br br the wannabe hard hitting attitudes to drugs and depiction of prostitution must have looked laughably outdated even before the celluloid <UNK> but the script at least is very <UNK> in that it explains exactly what's happening regularly in horribly contrived were you followed oh no of course not no one outside washington even knows you're here yet despite this the plot somehow remains confusing by the time a sinister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> priest no less than from from russia with love up to his <UNK> to deliver a <UNK> your brain will have switched off which is unfortunate because you'll miss our hero <UNK> to the ground during a fight struggling to reach for a <UNK> of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol and him shouting you at his friend's murdered corpse and the leather bound go go boys the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence all of which provide ample laughs only the climactic boat chase <UNK> it's an exciting well directed sequence that really has no place in this movie such a glaring <UNK> is explained when the credits roll reeve had nothing to do with that sequence thankfully everything goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous spit out your drink twist and warehouse shootout br br unless such a wretched thing as a geoffrey reeve <UNK> exists and you're one of them i wouldn't bother with this instantly forgettable nonsense
<START> dylan and bobby are <UNK> friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are but dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those <UNK> things aside bobby knows that he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with dylan br br told as part cheesy 80's pop video part home movie part video <UNK> this film tells a confusing and sad but all too often true story that will hit home with many that see it br br this film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true <UNK> with me but i wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note yes we all love and lose even when we are young but there's always tomorrow especially when we are young
<START> three kids are born during a <UNK> <UNK> and turn into vile murderous little <UNK> <UNK> above suspicion by everyone save for <UNK> <UNK> and her younger brother timmy that's the story in a nutshell the acting in this one is tolerable for the most part notable for mtv j julie brown not the one showing some skin and a very early part <UNK> small for michael <UNK> not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but in the <UNK> kids' sub genre it's a bit of a guilty pleasure br br eye candy julie brown shows t a the only film thus far to claim that honor sylvia wright gets topless br br dvd extras <UNK> 16 minute interview with producer max <UNK> <UNK> he insults the director and canada great stuff biography of ed hunt and trailers for kiss of the don't open the door a red band one for <UNK> which features nudity br br my grade b
<START> as a french i found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype which is made of french like that at some <UNK> of <UNK> at spy movies etc and at a lot of other things too en route i already saw it 3 times and each time i discovered new things and laughed to tears jean the director and all the cast all the crew did a fantastic job this movie is funny but is although much more than that it's got plenty of levels to it you laugh because of simple gags because of some critics made with wit the movie's courageous enough to be critical because of physical comedy because you believe in the characters etc <UNK> and <UNK> it's a success too go see it if you can
<START> john cassavetes is on the run from the law he is at the bottom of the heap he sees <UNK> sidney <UNK> as his equal and they quickly become friends <UNK> a sort of alliance against a bully of a <UNK> played by jack warden br br as someone who has worked in a warehouse myself when i was younger i can tell you that the warehouse fights complete with <UNK> <UNK> cases and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are as realistic as it gets i've been in fights like these myself although no one got killed br br the introduction of sidney <UNK> widow is a variation on shakespeare's <UNK> do i not bleed this is an anti racist film which at the time was much needed br br all the three principle characters warden cassavetes and <UNK> are superb with warden the most outstanding of the three
<START> ronald coleman had been a star of the screen for several years when <UNK> came in and what a boost it was to his career his <UNK> english accent is so enthralling i could listen to him <UNK> the <UNK> and not be bored br br coleman plays willie hale a <UNK> playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time <UNK> and gambling yet he's a likable rogue not only likable from the standpoint of the audience but by family and friends too he has yet again gone broke due to his constant gambling and sells off his <UNK> in a foreign location to settle his <UNK> and provide passage back home to england when he gets there he at first is met by a father who insists he'll kick him out he's had it with willie and his <UNK> ways however five minutes alone in a room with willie and his charm and willie is not only forgiven by dad dad has given him one hundred pounds to boot br br willie then goes for a day's recreation with his sister and her friend dorothy hope loretta young dorothy is set to be engaged to the grand duke paul that very night mainly just because her dad wants <UNK> in the family and there is nobody else special in her life that changes after her day with willie and soon there is a scandal <UNK> as dorothy refuses to go through with the marriage as planned br br ronald coleman is always a delight to watch in these early talking films he did for sam <UNK> where he is playing the confident <UNK> or <UNK> or both he has a demeanor akin to errol flynn but he is unable to display <UNK> physical <UNK> due to a <UNK> wound he received during world war i however what he lacks in physical <UNK> coleman always made up in <UNK> of soul loretta young only 17 when this picture was made shows the beginning of her trademark sweet girl that can <UNK> into a ball of fire when the occasion calls for it myrna loy plays <UNK> girl from the past mary a <UNK> here myrna is still playing a part similar to the exotic <UNK> parts she got stuck with so often over at warner brothers when she was a contract player from <UNK> until shortly before this movie was made in 1930 br br this is pretty much a light and <UNK> romantic comedy from start to finish if you're in a mood for the kind of <UNK> entertainment that <UNK> the hearts of audiences during the great depression this little film fits the bill
<START> i have seen this movie only once several years ago but i remember liking it a lot br br spoilers ahead an old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune he puts <UNK> drops in their milk when they wake up they find themselves miles away they must journey back to their house before it is too late with the help of an independent minded <UNK> and other animal <UNK> while <UNK> the butler and <UNK> his plan br br could have been better but it also could have been a lot worse br br my score 7 10
<START> the only good thing about this movie is that i now have a movie on the worst ever list rest stop being on the end of the spectrum where i can compare all terrible movies to really this movie is the worst plot worst directed throughout the whole movie all i wanted to do is pull out my hair and kick the writer's and anybody who made this movie ass i am a <UNK> soldier and when i spend my precious <UNK> watching movies like this these people should feel terrible they had to of watch this before it came out and must have been to freaking lazy to <UNK> after they noticed it freaking sucked i am so amazed that this great country of <UNK> is letting them make another honestly this is the first time i have ever commented on a movie i had to let the world know not to waste their time <UNK> this movie from the face of this planet it makes us humans look retarded
<START> it's showtime showtime is simply a <UNK> in eddie murphy and robert <UNK> careers it's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards especially not <UNK> showtime is directed by tom <UNK> and features some small roles from guys like william shatner and <UNK> <UNK> br br showtime is about two very different cops mitch preston deniro and <UNK> <UNK> murphy one takes work seriously in a low profile quiet manner while the other is more easy going and wants to have more fun than <UNK> in his back seat they are both after the same <UNK> behind a huge caper of <UNK> <UNK> etc they then cross paths and a tv station wants a new reality tv show so they fight crime while they are on tv mitch hates the publicity while <UNK> loves it with his line it's showtime their tv antics and methods are shown on tv and they are the new cops show the fun begins br br overall showtime is a fun action comedy a good film but not quite up to the actors' expectations and standards however it's rolls along as it <UNK> and parodies reality tv shows a good break from shows like cops truly at the end just a guilty pleasure br br my rating 7 10 br br <UNK> a
<START> i saw unfortunately the dubbed version on <UNK> br br student paula <UNK> <UNK> who was also in the cult favorite run lola run stars as a serious medical student who gets into a <UNK> school in germany but she soon discovers that some students go missing and the bodies they work on in the <UNK> lab are incredibly fresh br br i was stuck seeing the dubbed version on <UNK> it hurt a lot the words not matching the lips got annoying real quick but i still liked what i saw the acting was good it was beautifully photographed it wasn't too gruesome and i was never bored even more refreshing was a likable heroine who fights back when the bad guys go after her the mild nudity was in a refreshing twist male a previous poster mentions <UNK> <UNK> who is excellent showed his butt but i don't remember seeing it regardless this is a well done scary and excellent thriller from all i've read the original german language version is the best i don't doubt that for one second but the dubbed version is watchable i give this a 7
<START> this film is really really bad it is not very well done and is a lack <UNK> attempt at something but i am not sure what i watched it and was very disappointed it promised a lot but delivered nothing at all the characters are shallow and wooden and the music if you can call it that is dreadful there are of course all the creatures and animated beings but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie it is a real shame that more attention could not have been spent to the special effects not the be all and end all of a movie i agree but in a movie that is based around them it's a very important factor for me a very sad attempt and should be avoided
<START> i've got to say it gary busey saved this film if it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par i recommend the film but just barely br br the biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical <UNK> and physical accuracy for example why is green and <UNK> how come <UNK> producer petty ignored where are the daily <UNK> to the <UNK> new mexico studio why is <UNK> treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the holly sound why was <UNK> two week <UNK> to maria treated as a complex taboo race mixing stereotype why are <UNK> <UNK> boxes as light as <UNK> finally why are the <UNK> portrayed as trouble making to <UNK> talent br br taken on their face these inaccuracies should spell doom for any film <UNK> itself the buddy holly story however busey does deliver a stirring portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died
<START> <UNK> boy's own paper nonsense with a <UNK> performance from cushing some amusing rubber monsters colourful jungle sets the ever welcome appearance of caroline <UNK> in animal <UNK>
<START> alexander <UNK> is nothing short of a grand film on a grand scale the film opens a window to a world and culture most americans will never become <UNK> with and much has been said and written regarding the film's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the face of <UNK> war with the german nazis br br by us standards the acting is a bit stilted the screenplay is short on words and big on visuals and action and while the action can become tiresome the visuals are often stunning direction is incredible br br on another note fans of ralph bakshi animation might notice that he stole a lot of his visuals for <UNK> directly from a copy of alexander <UNK>
<START> this is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it the acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot as a french noir film its language is certainly a lot <UNK> than its american counterparts but to me this just added to the realism additionally i liked how non glamorous everyone was particularly the husband and the lieutenant about the only negative and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10 is because there was a glaring plot hole like another famous french film <UNK> de the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning but the characters made rather stupid decisions for this you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching the payoff is well worth the wait br br this is simply one of the finest french films i have seen period
<START> i'm not sure what version of the film i saw but it was very entertaining br br i did not know who the twins were gillian <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> before seeing this movie and i think the english translation of the title is somewhat misleading br br the martial arts are very nicely done i especially liked them because there was a lot of <UNK> <UNK> that was filmed very nicely <UNK> <UNK> see him in hero great performance as a director is great as he knows how to shoot these scenes br br everything seemed to flow for me except there is one scene where the girls are on the <UNK> fighting with <UNK> <UNK> it has really nothing to do with the plot but it's still entertaining br br overall this is one of the better modern hk action flicks i've seen in a while although cheesy in some respects it still pulls it off br br definitely a 9 10
<START> the efforts of a new group of young talent <UNK> by alan <UNK> and emma thompson 2 extremely gifted actors makes for a thrilling and engrossing evening of entertainment and i might add that hal <UNK> shines as the senator this movie deserves five stars i give it a ten on your scale and the ending is perfect i am constantly amazed at the ability of british actors to master our american accents i was convinced that all the actors were born in <UNK> and what <UNK> locale for a mystery than new orleans the big easy also known as the <UNK> city <UNK> every scene as writer and director sebastian deserves high praise
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i've ever saw a 14 year old boy jason shepherd wrote an english paper called big fat liar when his <UNK> was taken he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a <UNK> when he went into the <UNK> he met a famous producer from hollywood marty wolf when he left the <UNK> he forgot one thing his paper so marty wolf took it and he turned <UNK> english paper into a movie when jason admitted that he left his paper in the <UNK> and marty took it his parents and his english teacher didn't believe him so jason and his friend had to fly to los angeles to go to hollywood to make marty admit he stole his story to <UNK> parents when jason told marty to call his dad that marty stole that paper marty tricked him and burned his paper jason got so angry that marty burned that paper so marty called security to get jason out of his site jason and realized marty isn't going to admit the truth in order to take marty down in phase 2 the jason and put permanent blue <UNK> into the pool and when marty jumps in his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off then they put permanent orange <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and when he uses it his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too finally they put lots of <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> to make him call <UNK> father and when marty uses it it sticks to his ear it was funny when <UNK> hair and body turns all blue and orange and his <UNK> is glued to his ear after that they tricked marty by telling monty who is <UNK> assistant that <UNK> moved to a house where there's a party going on when marty went in to see <UNK> he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up when marty was in the house jason and switched the controls of his car when marty drove his car he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push he's stupid enough to fall for it when marty hit the rear end of the the <UNK> his car it was so funny so marty starts to call <UNK> dad and tricked him again he was on the phone but it wasn't his father he called security after the security got jason and out of <UNK> site they suggested them to go home monty was going to be on jason and side cause she knew that marty was a liar and a jerk so she told <UNK> who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids jason told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to l a when monty came to the kids she's going to help the kids move into phase 4 the <UNK> jason <UNK> the crew into 3 teams for phase 4 one team will distract and trick marty until <UNK> parents get to the set marty first <UNK> with frank jackson but his car broke down so he <UNK> with but he took him into the desert and leave him there when marty was in the desert a helicopter came to rescue him after that one of the <UNK> are <UNK> so marty and the pilot got off the helicopter after that he was on the way to the set and when jason saw him marty stopped and saw what jason has his monkey so marty went after jason and and when they saw lester he released the water and when the water came it pushed marty away marty was still after the kids and when went the other way jason led marty to the top of the apartment building at the top jason was challenging marty by making him admit the truth and marty will never ever tell the truth when the crew caught marty in surprise all the people including <UNK> parents who were at the set knew what marty did marty was going to kill jason but the only way for jason to escape is jump down from the top after that his parents believed him that marty took his story when the people who were on the set left this is the end of marty at the end <UNK> story big fat liar was a movie i cant get enough of it
<START> it's one of the <UNK> of basil <UNK> wartime anti nazi sherlock holmes films voice of terror sh in washington and this one that while the plots and settings are mostly terrible he is so good in them despite a bizarre wind swept <UNK> meant to make him look younger he <UNK> through every scene with so much bite and attack that you hardly register how flimsy the plots are here he also has great acting <UNK> with lionel <UNK> who makes a wonderfully repulsive professor <UNK> a heavy <UNK> with nice hints of <UNK> and <UNK> it may not have been acting kids at the climax changed into a lab coat in order to drain <UNK> blood drop by drop he's as over the top sinister as <UNK> arch nemesis newman the movie itself is ancient kiddie <UNK> fare but it benefits from director roy william <UNK> attention to staging and atmosphere it also looks fairly sharp in the dvd's <UNK> <UNK> don't even think of buying any other edition all of them faded choppy public <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie was terrible my friend and i were so bored by it we fast <UNK> through the last half of the movie just to see what happened it's the typical sports thing she either wins or she loses the only remotely interesting thing was when the one guy refers to someone as a <UNK> e <UNK> le that will be a line my friend and i bring up for years to come reminding us of this <UNK> cheesy cliche waste of time
<START> what would it be like to be accused of being a <UNK> this is what this film explores through the eyes of 2 characters one being the accused <UNK> the other being the <UNK> it is a frightening journey from the beginning to the end this film is not for everybody and if you do not understand political <UNK> thoroughly you will never get the point of this film as proved by 90 of the reviews here
<START> little vera is the story of a russian teenager her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life <UNK> increasingly into <UNK> in her search for meaning she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious <UNK> whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents quickly <UNK> out of control br br little vera is shocking and disturbing in nearly every way the drinking of the father the <UNK> and lack of understanding of the mother the casual lies and <UNK> of the brother and vera herself <UNK> them all their flaws are all shocking and slightly disturbing to watch however the raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters set in <UNK> spaces and vast urban <UNK> little vera presented a vastly different view of soviet life than had ever been seen before in fact little vera is a portrait of the collapse of soviet society painted in shades of pain desperation and <UNK> it is the <UNK> of a family set against the <UNK> of an entire social order br br although painful and desperately unsatisfying the film itself is definitely worth seeing if only to understand the feelings and cultures still <UNK> russia today
<START> i've read <UNK> reviews talking about the <UNK> of the mini series i certainly can't agree on such a <UNK> statement if you analyze all of the aspects of a video film production there are areas where the film is arguably vastly superior br br certainly many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the mini series specifically regarding more threads customs officers and more developed threads such as the <UNK> farmer and family that said i found catherine zeta jones' character much more compelling as the desperate women from poverty to <UNK> who won't go back that's a much more likable character than this cold women who didn't seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil and yes i understand her children she was desperate i just didn't see her as being as desperate br br further while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the mini series <UNK> del <UNK> character was very compelling an anchor for the film that thread was changed as an alternative to the <UNK> family in nothing but good ways a fantastic adaptation of course i'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system but i don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue br br after watching the first episode of the mini series i actually <UNK> the film why i kept reading about the fantastic acting i found the performances in the first episode of the mini series to be borderline laughable certainly this improved as the mini series progressed now having just finished both versions in a few days i can't agree that the performances in the mini series reached the same level as say <UNK> del toro who was brilliant in the film though <UNK> shah and lindsay <UNK> were very good i also feel the police in the film far <UNK> the mini series i was not impressed with the germans throughout br br finally the dialogue as delivered in the film is much more nuanced especially in the scenes which are almost <UNK> careful you're beginning to sound like your husband as opposed to <UNK> you sound like karl again i found some of the acting in the mini series very unconvincing this was a prime example br br other superior aspects of the film in my opinion score cinematography editing br br should i complain that the film wasn't longer no i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format the changes made stood on their own i mean would you sit in a theater for 5 7 10 hours of course not br br mini series 8 out of 10 br br film 9 out of 10
<START> so the wwe has done it they have <UNK> over into film their first one being see no evil starring their very own kane i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film it just seemed to cliché and looked like nothing new to my surprise it actually wasn't half bad a viewer stated above that it is good b horror movie fun and honestly thats the best way to describe it now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the character he sold the role really well and really did look menacing but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and <UNK> around in solid muscle the acting was decent and the story was nothing new of course but we all know that the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked <UNK> and well done considering this was directed by a porn movie director i was quite surprised i'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film and save room for the ending too <UNK> it's a good one and stick around after the credits too
<START> i first saw the buddy holly story when i was about seven years old i had no idea who buddy holly was nor can i remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television tuned in to hbo and watch this engaging biopic what i remember was realizing that it was a somewhat true story about someone who actually lived i recall the music great songs that i still love today i can't believe gary busey sang his own songs and so well what a stud then came the end he died he freaking died i couldn't believe it i had no warning no prior knowledge like most coming into this film it taught me a harsh lesson about life and how it doesn't follow the rules that most movies teach us i just watched the film again tonight and was engaged all over again and a little <UNK> br br 8 out of 10 but i'll admit to a little bias
<START> the saving grace of this film is its humour playing up to the strengths of their star warner brothers cast their version of general <UNK> as a cocky dashing <UNK> <UNK> with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of <UNK> it was robin hood all over again and flynn <UNK> in the role all his best action pictures made use of his talent for <UNK> and comic timing and this one was no exception br br it also benefits from the return of former co star olivia de <UNK> despite an earlier <UNK> to break the <UNK> the part of strong minded <UNK> <UNK> is a better role than the sweet love interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in <UNK> later films and after seeing the script he had specifically <UNK> de <UNK> be cast so that she could do justice to the part in this final collaboration she <UNK> all her considerable acting skill into what is at heart basically a <UNK> adventure movie and the screen chemistry is for once she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple to equally winning effect br br the flynn de <UNK> pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's <UNK> when most of <UNK> other westerns held in such affection by the contemporary american public although allegedly not by their star have long since been forgotten the action scenes are fairly <UNK> despite ironically the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges and the villains of the piece turn out <UNK> fashion to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point and thus continue to <UNK> him throughout his career it cuts down on the cast list but it's a <UNK> too morally convenient br br however these are <UNK> largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment <UNK> aided and <UNK> by a sterling group of supporting players <UNK> including anthony quinn in an all but <UNK> role as the <UNK> leader errol flynn <UNK> his way through the plot courtesy of his usual <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> looks unexpected <UNK> mischievous flash point <UNK> cheerful <UNK> and sheer high <UNK> charisma he's a reckless <UNK> but you can't help but like him and it's hard to go away without the tune of <UNK> its <UNK> way through your ears for many days thereafter br br this is one of <UNK> lasting hits it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun and is a film worthy of being remembered
<START> this is an amazing movie and is very clever at using the few actors and sets it is also very shocking the physical and psychological torture both explicit and implied is mixed with calm and even <UNK> stretches so the horror is always unexpected and brutal i'm not soft but this would have to be the most shocking film i have ever seen the message of this film is definitely delivered with a <UNK> this is the film i will always remember both actors for
<START> sure it seems like there is only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode but it is certainly fun to watch you might find yourself cringing in your chair as buddy sticks his foot in his mouth and gets shot down or <UNK> and shaking your head when some ridiculous line actually works the <UNK> of <UNK> have more of a good natured friendly dare i say canadian style of commentary compared with <UNK> us reality programming i think the people who complain about this show don't get the joke they are taking the show more seriously than the show takes itself keys to the <UNK> is a great caricature of reality shows sports tv culture and the club scene i hope they do another season and i'd be interested to see if a us version appears it's certainly a fun original premise

<START> i worked on this atrocity ten years ago luckily for me no one knows it because i didn't make the final cut and when i saw the movie in the theaters i was glad my agents were driven nuts by the apparently first time filmmakers <UNK> the script daily and changing their <UNK> with the <UNK> just as often they later told me that once back in california we shot in <UNK> these professionals had 4 1 2 hours worth of footage even edited down to 90 minutes it's at least twice as long as it needs to be i found hulk hogan surprisingly charming but otherwise what a waste of film
<START> no emotion bad music and i am a <UNK> eighties metal guy so i would be vulnerable to some good stuff everything is half done the brother is a parody there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties they'll pull up next the tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time <UNK> is okay and aniston is <UNK> we know she didn't need the money is this the only role she could fit into her summer break surely she must slap her <UNK> every time it pops up on <UNK> which is only slightly less often than <UNK> does it barely qualifies as a tv movie it's just hard to believe that it was actually released <UNK>
<START> <UNK> anthony mann made westerns with 'the big <UNK> james stewart gary cooper henry fonda the a list cowboy stars but in this b film he <UNK> something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western the main character played by victor mature is a <UNK> mountain man and <UNK> they are <UNK> in films robert redford in johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men not here for once a true mountain man vulgar crude <UNK> is the central figure and it's something to see giving mature one of his better later roles the real acting chops are provided by robert preston excellent as a self absorbed <UNK> type <UNK> commander and james <UNK> the poor man's spencer tracy as another of those old <UNK> who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the <UNK> force of civilization on the other even more impressive is a very young anne <UNK> as the <UNK> wife who is initially <UNK> by the very sight of <UNK> grisly character then finds her own <UNK> of civilization <UNK> away as she begins to realize to her own shock that she's attracted to him rarely if ever has a remote frontier <UNK> been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic <UNK> that john ford gave such a place in his masterful <UNK> <UNK> the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format good show and underrated movie all around
<START> my buddies and i spent the majority of a saturday afternoon watching a selection of bad movies among the flicks we watched the strongest <UNK> for quality bad movie fare was easily jack o it's ludicrous that movies such as <UNK> <UNK> and you got served are listed in <UNK> bottom 100 while they're certainly bad movies they don't belong in the bottom 100 they're robbing jack o and keeper of time etc of the bad movie greatness they so richly deserve br br so what makes jack o so great in bad movie terms for starters steve the director decided to cast his son ryan in the role of sean kelly unfortunately for steve ryan was dangerously close to being out acted by a block of wood the kid seriously has no ability to <UNK> whatsoever the end result unintentional comic gold the kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting his head <UNK> <UNK> and his expression is one of <UNK> br br the other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming sequences what is a double dream well it's when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare clever device no i believe the character of sean kelly experienced no less than 3 double dreaming sequences br br let's see what else oh yeah this movie has a <UNK> cast of thousands it's truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story they're either killed by jack o or they serve no purpose whatsoever br br jack o himself was pretty sweet like most other b movie monsters jack o has the amazing ability to seemingly <UNK> over great <UNK> he's <UNK> hanging out somewhere in the background whenever you're dealing with a major character what's puzzling however is that when he's actually chasing someone he moves at a <UNK> stumbling speed and yet he's able to keep up with people who are <UNK> br br that's all for now closing remarks if you're looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you can't go wrong by renting this beast br br bad movie score 7 10 good movie score 3 5 10
<START> i am not quite sure what to say think about this movie it is definitely not the worst in the series there's still halloween 3 the style is just very different and it focuses on other elements than its predecessor did it tries to explain why michael myers freaks out on halloween and starts <UNK> around well all that stuff about michael myers being cursed and the evil cult was a rather nice effort but i didn't buy it none of the other <UNK> in the series tried to come up with any fancy explanations br br the movie contains lots of gore actually it's plain carnage if you haven't seen the other halloween films you will probably like this one for its blood content but for a real halloween freak this sequel might be just too different to be seen as a good one suspense was turned into terror and carnage exploding heads you get the point br br the ending theatrical cut is simply awful michael gets stabbed with a <UNK> then beaten up with a <UNK> then stabbed again this time with more <UNK> then beaten up a little more until there's <UNK> running out of his head where did this green stuff come from anyway basically it's nothing more than trash worth 5 million br br there was one good thing though michael's mask br br dedicated to donald <UNK> quite a disgrace br br my rating 4 10
<START> although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast ice cream i scream is more like a caricature of sincerity br br the plot opens with the dream of ali a traveling ice cream salesman in a western town in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice cream companies he dreams of playing in his tv commercial with beautiful models in <UNK> dancing around him as his dream turns into a nightmare he wakes up with a big <UNK> next to his <UNK> wife who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason is it because he is not successful in his job apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies but this is what he says we actually don't see him suffer that much he still sells good traveling the <UNK> <UNK> while his apprentice stays at the shop selling ice cream to the people in the town ali blames big companies for using and <UNK> agents while he is using real <UNK> roots of mountain <UNK> ali buys a <UNK> with a bank <UNK> to be a traveling <UNK> and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news <UNK> in local <UNK> his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always <UNK> and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy br br in a very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the <UNK> little boys of the town in search of his stolen bike ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the <UNK> but of course nobody takes him seriously annoyed by the <UNK> of his wife ali goes to a <UNK> and becomes drunk one of his friends at his table a wannabe <UNK> of the town gives a <UNK> speech and <UNK> and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global <UNK> ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison his wife wakes up and <UNK> him an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and <UNK> him about life according to him ali can even sell hot drink if the world faces with global <UNK> when he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like a hero and <UNK> his <UNK> meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much ice cream they confess to the doctor that they stole bike ali <UNK> them and there comes the happy end br br although the plot may look promising in a way it's the story telling which makes this film <UNK> and cheesy first the director doesn't show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything is based on dialogs and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art even troubles are not convincing because we don't see it we just understand it from his words the director <UNK> his film as a righteous fight of ali against big ice cream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies we don't see their pressure enough the film actually <UNK> ali for believing that big companies are behind the <UNK> and when his <UNK> is found it <UNK> every problem ali becomes a happy and powerful husband not a real criticism of br br second the film is cheesy because of the crude humor maybe the people of that part of turkey is <UNK> so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy maybe i'm wrong maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor but american pie never had any claim to be a <UNK> for the oscars or to have a political message if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man's big <UNK> in his shorts and we had to endure this joke twice or an old <UNK> woman saying f k you then you may find this film funny
<START> the earlier review is pretty much on target which altman was not with this film i haven't seen it since its original release but i have seldom spent two hours in a theater feeling as miserable and disappointed as i was with this film if some pretentious community theater attempted a sci fi version of a <UNK> bergman film it might come off like this i can't bring myself to give anything altman has made a 1 but this is probably the <UNK> of a career that has had some remarkable <UNK> and <UNK> i would have walked out but as a paid film critic i couldn't think about that the next time you envy movie critics
<START> nice movie at the <UNK> i thought it's a detective kind hi fi movie but the ending totally surprised me i guess the whole movie covers too many subjects each of them can be the main subject e g avenge friendship and dream but it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them i think it'd be a great movie if it's built around the ending from the very <UNK> br br
<START> this is the follow up creation to better off dead in a competition better off dead would win hands down but for star power one crazy summer <UNK> savage <UNK> better script problems with one crazy summer casting better off dead <UNK> was cast so much better friendship shows cusack giving hateful looks to bill <UNK> little <UNK> trouble on the set more outrageous friends in but more genuine friends in <UNK> plot was good you'll predict some of it but even the predictable parts go further than you think they could so even though this is better off <UNK> ugly <UNK> it's worth a look see <UNK> moore before the plastic surgery if for no other reason john cusack fans you gotta see it just to say you have if you don't like <UNK> i'm sorry i don't like him either but you can't escape him in this one at least he does a great job in the film doing a tribute to another movie monster editing needed help on the beach but for most part not much to complain about overall it's good and funny but try not to compare it to <UNK> or you'll find it lacking sigh
<START> i am a <UNK> <UNK> in the field of symbolic and i must say that this film <UNK> high quality in the symbolic context throughout the entire film to anyone who has not yet seen this i recommend that you also read man's search for ultimate meaning by victor e i think you will be able to draw some amazing br br that being said i would like to say that despite the fact that the main characters are gay this is not a story about being gay this is a story about seeking out and finding meaning in life despite the difficulties and challenges the pain and terror that stand in your way this is a story of seeking and finding balance and <UNK> and happiness
<START> in the european tv industry movies like this one are called <UNK> tv stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to let's say titanic some not really blockbusters were a part of the deal br br 14 hours is a story of a hospital its employees and patients who have to face the worst <UNK> slash storm ever unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low budget film br br <UNK> babies are very obviously not real there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor acting the actors are not believable in their roles their lines when spoken sound way too <UNK> as if this was a read out camera test
<START> based on a true story br br the premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events its possible for an <UNK> mother to get drawn into heroin addiction br br semi spoiler some of the scenes are fairly inaccurate whilst others almost make you want to get the yourself br br computer <UNK> graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teen kid <UNK> into addiction after work colleague who is a someone who can take enjoy it now and again then <UNK> into an addiction that leads her eventually to <UNK> off dealers after losing contact with her steady dealer br br the scenes that show her coming down and getting <UNK> are often very real especially the first real <UNK> <UNK> prior to all these events she began a relationship with a guy who just happened to have lost his wife to the bottle and insists he has an inner radar not to get hooked on such women some radar however after after some late turn ups and weird behaviour the boyfriend challenges her as to <UNK> is going <UNK> his radar begins to get more with it and demands that she empty out her bag she hits the roof and <UNK> out br br because of the excellent and open relationship she had developed prior to this tragedy he is the first to <UNK> some real evidence in her bag he then looks around the <UNK> for her apparently his sensibility is from school lessons on drug taking and when he discovers a large <UNK> in the bathroom he <UNK> it not a happy woman when she takes her next bath and its br br the kid keeps one back and places it on the meal table she then goes into further denial admits it and says its no worse than <UNK> br br <UNK> kid does all the right things and calls her friends and generally puts her in a position where she has to come <UNK> if you'll <UNK> the pun br br the movie takes the viewer through some pretty <UNK> situations where danger is not far away br br she gets help from a professional <UNK> and does cold turkey you'll have to watch the film to see what happens next
<START> i have read both the book and saw the movie today the storyline is so powerful that almost any script or screenplay would have done justice to it so nothing much there however this is still a beautiful movie because it makes one think and feel just like the book watching it is not like watching a documentary on a failed state and feeling sympathetic towards people suffering under an oppressive regime but is like watching any other common man's story unfold across generations across <UNK> <UNK> his guilt his <UNK> and finally his choosing a way of redemption could have been a story of any of us there isn't a single <UNK> character to look up to and <UNK> but all of them are gray just like all of us br br another important observation is that the movie does a great job of <UNK> the lives of <UNK> through the twenty some years of <UNK> political scenarios the vibrant care free childhood represents <UNK> before the russian invasion and the desolate <UNK> remains of the city echo what the <UNK> has done to it br br the child actors deserve <UNK> all the way they can put any <UNK> actor to shame br br if you have not yet seen the movie or read the book just walk into the theater keeping in mind that you are going to witness a multi layered story woven on a multi colored fabric of human emotions and sentiments this movie is not meant to stir anti soviet and anti <UNK> feelings but to feel the trials of human existence br br i read some of the <UNK> reviews linked to the site and i must confess i do not see the point in writing reviews that <UNK> the storyline like a distant <UNK> and point out technical details about amazing cinematography or something similar at least for this movie one should try to connect to it rather than judging it <UNK>
<START> it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw however as the actors are the same i can only think that the cut i saw in europe <UNK> from the one <UNK> in the us br br anyway this was the worst movie that i saw the past five years closely followed by the <UNK> br br why because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller <UNK> this one mixed them put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it br br examples nothing the music gets scary and still nothing the grumpy officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor <UNK> any acting class <UNK> a buddy moment which comes out of nowhere at the end <UNK> an <UNK> scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone br br if you want to see a smart movie see <UNK> if you want to see a better thriller see any thriller that comes to mind if you want to see patrick <UNK> see dirty dancing
<START> this movie is absolutely terrible <UNK> a bull t story and even worse acting too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies br br the special effects are 'a <UNK> standard with the classical car gets shot and then <UNK> over with a little <UNK> under the hood br br of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say ' die evil <UNK> br br unless <UNK> movies are you game don't spend of your life on this rubbish pick up 'the or <UNK> <UNK> instead
<START> a very comical but down to earth look into the behind the scene <UNK> of an australian <UNK> club the way they deal with various problems such as <UNK> and general running of the club not to mention the car parking dilemma was well scripted
<START> this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films there's no sentimentality no patriotic agenda not even a hopeful message of universal <UNK> in this bleak glimpse of what we can only call hell it's this quiet <UNK> and lack of manipulation that give the film its astounding power there aren't any attempts to make a hero out of protagonist <UNK> either he's just a poor doomed <UNK> trying to stay alive in a world of horror who hopes but isn't sure he can hang on to his humanity in the process fierce lack of cant and illusion make fires on the plain stand alone <UNK> died <UNK> 2008
<START> there is only one word to define the whole movie that is awful how mostly martha was remade is awful the title of the movie is awful the actors are awful and the idea of combining good cooking and usa is awful if you have seen <UNK> martha well that is the original title and it means beautiful martha this one is a punch in the stomach the acting of ms jones is so poor and unnatural that even jessica alba considered one of the worst actresses http www <UNK> com history would have done better not to mention the cook who would better play a different role and the little girl not worth mentioning <UNK> martha was a very nice movie an authentic one why was it remade there was a story here they took it out there is no story what shall it represent in one way also this movie was perfect you know when all ingredients fit together well this is the case here a perfect crap
<START> i've seen worse which is a <UNK> way of saying how crummy this film was the plot is ridiculous a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage in a <UNK> lit <UNK> new york school and somehow this clichéd hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve are you serious a day long hostage situation with a wounded <UNK> officer no less takes all day i realize this film was made pre 9 11 but still i looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and 10 minutes br br the acting was mediocre at best all around and the characters were seemingly thought up by <UNK> <UNK> the child abuse kid the pregnant scared girl the violent gang wannabe a confused unfortunate victim the wise cracking white guy please br br trying to make this hostage situation into a mission for more <UNK> and better school conditions please this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop they're confused ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb far fetched situation don't try and paint them suddenly as noble the most laughable is <UNK> who lives in the <UNK> attic and <UNK> <UNK> so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls you've got to be kidding me br br the no racism signs in the <UNK> crowd a black kid shoots a black cop and a black <UNK> tries to <UNK> it all up this is a random message br br i understand the overall message which was poorly portrayed albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careers br br this was a joke though the red sniper <UNK> on the roof the worst scene was the kid fake snow falling dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof promise me etc how original br br the <UNK> of i went to prison but now i'm pre law at university a fitting way to end a joke of a movie
<START> i cant go for long describing this simply because i do not feel strong about it i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic <UNK> seem to like it that's all i can say br br boring long sometimes even stupid br br p s 7 4 out of 10 the viewers must be going crazy br br i cant go for long describing this simply because i do not feel strong about it i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic <UNK> seem to like it that's all i can say br br boring long sometimes even stupid br br p s 7 4 out of 10 the viewers must be going crazy
<START> <UNK> willie <UNK> ' is often <UNK> <UNK> as the first mickey mouse film though that title actually goes to crazy <UNK> ' the source <UNK> this common <UNK> is probably an episode of the simpsons which places the origin of itchy the mouse in a <UNK> short called <UNK> itchy ' obviously a parody of this cartoon interestingly <UNK> <UNK> was itself a parody <UNK> the latest buster keaton release <UNK> bill jr <UNK> ' though the connection stretches little beyond the title and the general story setting in this walt disney short mickey mouse takes charge of a river <UNK> much to the annoyance of captain pete the cat who casts him aside but mickey is not to be <UNK> in <UNK> far removed from the pleasant wholesome mickey that more recent generations enjoyed this little mouse cares only for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pain and <UNK> on a series of farm animals in order to provide music for his own amusement br br first there's the laughing parrot which cops a bucket and a large <UNK> to the head then a goat is <UNK> by the tail to provide music turkey in the straw from a guitar it has <UNK> a cat is <UNK> around by its tail a <UNK> <UNK> about the throat and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for a children's cartoon <UNK> willie ' directed by walt disney and <UNK> certainly has some mean spirited humour though i also noticed similar elements though not quite to this extent in some later disney shorts like mickey 1934 ' let's not forget <UNK> mouse of course who suffers treatment for which she could today sue for sexual <UNK> the jokes may be crude and the animation perhaps even more so but this cartoon delivers a bucket full of laughs and it's easy to see why this little <UNK> became one of the most beloved characters in cinema history if you're a fan of mickey mouse or disney in general this is one <UNK> you can't afford to miss
<START> is a nice surprise a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not funny or romantic takes actors like will smith kevin james and eva <UNK> into a fun light as a <UNK> journey that actually had me laughing and yes a little <UNK> how sweet br br meet alex <UNK> will smith aka <UNK> he's a self <UNK> <UNK> he helps hopeless guys like albert kevin james win guys like <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> has to deal with sarah eva <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> bent on breaking the date doctor br br is actually pretty funny and it even makes the standard slapstick scenes work simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly having fun i have to wonder why will smith hasn't made more movies like this his sharp rapid fire delivery is perfect for this genre and his chemistry with <UNK> and james is wonderful james is a real discovery i have never seen his show 'the king of <UNK> but he is funny and heartfelt and he proves once more that fat white men cannot dance hip hop smith's <UNK> to his attempts are hilarious <UNK> is hot and <UNK> not that way <UNK> as smith's perfect match and <UNK> is sweet as br br isn't perfect it's a tad too long and things get too dramatic near the end although this is redeemed by the happy ending filled with funny dancing it a great <UNK> from the cookie cutter romantic comedies that keep <UNK> theaters

<START> a man wonders if his hunky co worker is gay at a yard sale he finds a ray gun called <UNK> you point it at a person pull the trigger and it tells you how gay they are he tries it out it works and he sets out to find out if his <UNK> is gay like him br br promising idea ruined by an unfunny script after a promising beginning and terrible acting the entire cast overacts and basically scream their lines at each other constantly it gets annoying and really <UNK> after a while the saving grace is that's it is short there's a scene stealing cat love her fall out of the kitty bed and charles nelson <UNK> is hysterical in his brief bit but none of this saves the movie i can't recommend this at all
<START> no matter what you've heard fame is not a good movie it's not worth the investment of over two hours to watch <UNK> troubled teens dancing singing learning and staring at girls in the dressing rooms br br every cliché finds a <UNK> little home in this movie there's a gay teenager looking for acceptance that would have been great if it had been treated as anything more than a secondary plot point there's a ghetto kid who has too much attitude what was i surprised and guess what they all want to become big stars finding fame and fortune and they'd all be willing to crawl over their own <UNK> smoking corpses to get it br br oddly enough this film is remembered for its music but in <UNK> the only moderately good song is hot lunch jam which is still too cheesy to be of any real quality the two most popular songs are nothing either fame is meaningless fluff drowned out by the sheer spectacle of a massive dancing in the streets scene and i sing the body electric what in name does that even mean is just an incomprehensible joke br br bad acting tasteless dialog and hack direction it is after all from the director of <UNK> are only <UNK> helped by michael appropriately ordinary camera work but cinematography alone cannot carry a movie especially one as uninspiring and pointless as this
<START> i'd never heard of this aussie horror prior to michael <UNK> enthusiastic review in fact after having read it i decided to check if the dvd was available at my local rental <UNK> and it was albeit a german edition i e sans the <UNK> extras so i <UNK> to check the film out immediately br br while i wouldn't go so far as to give it full marks  only a <UNK> few titles get them from me let alone an obscure modern flick  i have to say that i was quite impressed with black water rather than looking back to previous crocodile movies such as alligator 1980 and lake <UNK> 1999 it evokes the memory of two which saw a small group of people who go on a trip get lost and find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the creatures <UNK> the place  namely long weekend 1978 itself a little seen but impressive australian production and open water 2005 br br the <UNK> simply plotted film involves a couple and the woman's younger sister who decide to go fishing in a remote and <UNK> part of the australian wilderness known as crocodile territory very soon in fact before even 15 minutes have <UNK> their boat is and the guide killed by an alligator  so our <UNK> <UNK> take <UNK> up a tree the dvd talk reviewer believes the film suffers from spending too much time in this one location  with the three arguing about what they should do attempts to retrieve the boat seeking a way out of the jungle through the trees only to be met with nothing but water and the occasional attack by the monster however i think the makers take the situation as far as it will go without <UNK> into tedium this is due to the <UNK> suspense and as michael said the believability of the characters particularly the two women <UNK> also the fact that the crocodile here makes for one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory i wonder how they got it to br br i also agree with mike that the film contains some really effective shock moments  the alligator <UNK> out of the water to take a bite at the <UNK> heroes its head suddenly <UNK> in front of the women as they're making for the boat even though one of them does reach the vehicle the monster manages to lift its massive weight and get in the boat with her towards the end as the same girl manages to find a gun on the <UNK> body of their guide loads it and lies in wait for the alligator to appear the latter <UNK> up from behind her incidentally the creature is <UNK> with the <UNK> of the shark in jaws 1975 with this in mind the finale is just as crowd pleasing though on an obviously smaller scale as that of the classic spielberg blockbuster  even if it has a downbeat follow up another definite asset is the film's sparse score  which is generally rather lovely but becoming unnerving at just the right moments br br at the end of the day black water emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the <UNK> into which horror cinema has fallen of late for this reason alone it deserves greater exposure so as to remind us that there's hope yet for our beloved genre without the real necessity of <UNK> to the <UNK> of a <UNK> 2008 to command attention 
<START> i'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie br br 1 angelina jolie sex scene br br 2 <UNK> artist <UNK> themselves br br 3 plot was quite thick br br 4 dvd does includes trailers and chapter stops br br 5 no animals were <UNK> in the making of the movie br br 6 <UNK> to blade runner through out the film br br 7 burning trash <UNK> br br 8 funny guy with no legs br br 9 voice overs by jack palance added a real dynamic element to the film br br 10 <UNK> advise for example when you <UNK> with the devil bring a long <UNK> br br 11 angelina jolie was only 18 br br to sum it up an evening of entertainment was provided
<START> this is one of the best movies on the french revolution ever produced being a person well <UNK> in the the period i was amazed at the level of detail the costumes are spot on even the detailed little day to day items such as <UNK> wells serving <UNK> etc are all perfect as an american living in france who has access to the sites in the movie through his <UNK> in various historical <UNK> such as the <UNK> alliance i can not over state how impressed i was with the visual accuracy of the film br br the dialogue where known is virtual <UNK> and the where not recorded is in character i was extremely pleased with this movie and am disappointed that it is not out on dvd yet this is how historical drama should be done must see
<START> having seen only once and in the dawn hours i can't seem to forget this haunting film a mix of mystery suspense and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of vertigo the actors though not that well known are good especially joan <UNK> in one of her best performances you believe in her in her love in her <UNK> quest for freedom brought by her love and in the end in her overwhelming pain the plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility the direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect and it has one message don't let revenge blind you you can became its last victim a real pity it has not been remade but perhaps it is a period piece better left alone
<START> a truly remarkable film that takes you on a journey through your hidden emotions a deep and <UNK> story the story takes you through the lives and beliefs of gay and religious cultures with excellent performances from an superb star cast it will touch the deepest reaches of your emotions for those who belief that a love that risks nothing is worth nothing the film starts with introducing us to the characters that on the surface seem to have everything later we find that beneath the <UNK> of each character they are looking for a journey of self discovery we learn from this story that we all must chose the path in life that we are destined to be on despite what difficulties we encounter an all thumbs up film
<START> worst movie ever its not clever or funny or thought provoking <UNK> minutes of bad actors doing their best with an awful script br br acting was so bad that you can see the dead people breathing br br maybe the writer director combination believed they were quentin tarantino or something you know make a movie about nothing still cool but failed miserably br br i hope the writer never makes another movie ever not everyone is born a writer sometimes we need to count our <UNK> and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever br br please don't watch this movie even on mute with the <UNK> going its still a painful <UNK> mins
<START> george barry is a genius death bed the bed that eats is a prototype for much of the fiction and camp <UNK> that is so <UNK> now truly innovative maverick and just <UNK> brilliant hyper strange acting subtly nightmarish atmosphere i recommend reading stephen book nightmare usa there is a chapter devoted to barry and death bed the bed that eats available from <UNK> press on a related note death bed the bed that eats and beyond <UNK> door make a perfect double bill furthermore it's trite and tired and ultimately <UNK> ironic to criticize a low budget cult film for being <UNK> or inept ' the b movie aesthetic is part of these <UNK> charm no amount of cgi could <UNK> the <UNK> effect death bed the bed that eats has on the viewer with an advanced <UNK>
<START> my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv film does it work yes gee runs for mayor and gets shot the homicide hall of fame turns up <UNK> and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series a lot of flashbacks helps you who <UNK> seen the tv series but it <UNK> the fans too the last five minutes <UNK> another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up and a short appearance from my favourite <UNK> <UNK> cox this is a good film
<START> after watching this film i experienced a new sensation i had watched a film in which the lead actor had put in a performance that almost <UNK> the legend chevy chase in this isn't to say that the performances are comparable but both give practically flawless delivery of their lines that actor is marc singer singer is jack ford the of the title <UNK> out a living collecting the bounty on <UNK> there are some mutants topless pleasure <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and possibly a half hearted attempt to make a statement on class or maybe even <UNK> or well it doesn't really matter what matters about this film is the dry manner in which singer delivers his lines resulting in side splitting humour what matters about this film is that director fred <UNK> ray seems to realize that serious sci fi very rarely works and when your budget is skimpy it is best not to take yourself to seriously <UNK> ray has said that everyone involved in this film had great fun and this <UNK> onto the film i dare you to criticize a film that allows itself to portray futuristic earth as <UNK> dark and <UNK> lit and then ends in a and warehouse self parody is a very redeeming quality to <UNK> fred <UNK> ray is an <UNK> for independent film making and marc singer the perfect b movie lead if only <UNK> ray could draft in tim <UNK> to the <UNK> then we'd have a film on our hands
<START> the is a bad generic and boring movie the film has got a big problem it does not scare the performances and the screenplay are totally stupid it uses old tricks for <UNK> and all the supernatural events make laugh i would not call the as a bad movie i would call it an accidental comedy because it's so bad that makes laugh the only good thing about this movie is that it's short so this crap will not stay with us for so long there are a lot of masterpieces of horror genre which count with a low budget like subject two lucky or may which are sadly ignored while this crap is all a success in the box office so i do not recommend this weak and pathetic horror film which is called the
<START> this is a typical sandra <UNK> movie in which she plays a <UNK> but <UNK> woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero sound familiar br br there are plenty of holes in this story things just don't add up and some of the suspense is a little corny but that suspense is very good there is a lot of tension in this story which has strong paranoia running through it the story starts off slow but kicks in pretty soon and stays that way making it an involving movie for the viewer that's why i give it a pretty good rating the movie gets you involved in it <UNK> is more cute than annoying which she normally is to me so this is my highest rated movie with her in it
<START> this movie was alright mary kate and ashley play twin sisters sorry for stating the obvious who against their will are sent to paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that br br right away two french boys who looked slightly <UNK> start talking to them and taking interest blah blah blah it's an olsen twin movie we already know what's going to happen between them anyway along with that the twins meet a fabulous french model because they're in paris the fashion capital of the world they make <UNK> with the model and spend a fun montage of shopping in the city of lights yep br br <UNK> i frankly can't remember what happened i guess that could say something but hey it's an olsen movie olsen movie seems to be <UNK> with light entertainment br br overall this movie was annoying i mean can i really identify at all with two girls who are <UNK> upon hearing that they're going to paris really also the jokes really weren't that funny however i watched the whole movie so it had to be somewhat entertaining the fact that it was set in paris was what probably kept me watching
<START> this movie was one of the most boring horror movies i have seen in a long time and i have seen a lot personally i liked the <UNK> take on it all that was original but other than that it was pretty unwatchable i could not stand dee <UNK> as an actor nor as a singer i seemed that he was trying with everything he said to make it a memorable quote which they weren't i can get movies for free and i still didn't think it was worth the time to get
<START> this movie is so daring it doesn't attempt to hide its similarities to the shining it lacks the originality to do so and when it does near the end try to cover up its story of father goes psycho under influence of <UNK> haunted house in a foreign place it does so by <UNK> to plenty of other already established conventions and ideas in other words it <UNK> itself to mere cliche but hell even i enjoy a good predictable horror or thriller as long as there is an interesting story one filled with violence and gore somewhere before the film makes the dreadful turn towards the predictable and trite well this film doesn't have a good story and i was really disappointed with it what has going for it is remarkable direction and cinematography it is a film well shot and carefully constructed full of fun creepy angles and shots what doesn't have going for it is pretty much everything else to begin with a minor <UNK> the editing in this movie is obnoxious it jumps from one scene to the next sometimes <UNK> for example the old man in the movie who pretty much carries the background story later filled in by another character is <UNK> by a <UNK> running circles i mean it looks cool the first time but why continue to use the same image i guess you'd have to see it for yourself to understand what i mean another problem with this movie is anna <UNK> character who essentially <UNK> throughout the film crying and caring all too much about everything she's the film's failed attempt at a character driven horror film the movie has scenes of overblown <UNK> and the family drama it depicts is simply not believable by the end is a muddled melodrama with a non involving mystery provided with too simple of an ending and it's hardly scary
<START> i never really thought about watching this film i kept seeing it <UNK> on the horror movie shelf in my local video rental shop and never thought much about it just your run of the mill bland zombie flick with a bit of gore and a sex scene nothing special might as well watch python oh no wait that's a terrible film br br i only decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on tv and said it was an awful piece of trash so i decided to <UNK> these tales and only then did i realise how terrible the film hiding behind the bland and uninteresting dvd box cover was br br not that the idea is bad in itself a plane is a confined area and would be a real death trap for the people on board should zombies make their appearance a good premise for a zombie film but this film took a good setting and <UNK> all over it with poor acting <UNK> camera work annoying characters and a terrible score br br the characters all have different levels of <UNK> there are two young couples who are basically friends going on a vacation in france one couple is composed of a jock and his annoying bitchy girlfriend who is having an affair with mr best friend who came along with his girlfriend who is a blonde psycho there is also a policeman <UNK> a con man an <UNK> and highly annoying con man the policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters of the lot then there is a bunch of air <UNK> who mostly end up as zombie <UNK> no i didn't watch the whole film it was just too painful an experience to carry through almost as bad as watching cannibal holocaust oh and there's also a <UNK> on holiday with his wife some strange air <UNK> who really does not appear to be important until he's <UNK> to help deal with the zombie <UNK> a trio of scientists who all fall victim to the undead and a couple of pilots the camera work is often shaky and although many people don't seem to mind it can really get on your nerves after a while like having a small fly buzz constantly around your head it's small but it's there and it's annoying br br the <UNK> couple are genuinely annoying all they do is have sex in the <UNK> <UNK> while their <UNK> aren't looking in fact all the young adults in this film are insanely annoying they <UNK> bitch argue and have some of the most inane and mind boring dialogue in the movie yes it makes you glad to see them die br br the score is atrocious it is so generic and uninspired it kills any kind of suspense a scene could have generated and <UNK> it with the feeling that someone is <UNK> a <UNK> with their nails and laughing at you in fact it sounds like the score from python that film will never stop haunting me br br there is also a character that the film makers seemed incredibly intent on having in as many shots as possible a nun sitting near the young adults and <UNK> her bible who is included in so many shots you start to wonder if she plays any major part in the film but no she doesn't so why have her in so many scenes was it because the film's <UNK> original project was a nun porn flick nobody will ever know br br the zombies look pretty good their makeup is good and they are probably far better actors than the living characters they are far more convincing and likable the guard responsible for keeping an eye on the <UNK> illegal <UNK> was quite funny a large <UNK> appears to fall on him and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been <UNK> with some kind of sharp object yet he doesn't scream <UNK> or <UNK> in pain he just <UNK> and in an attempt to get the thing out of his leg in fact he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain br br ah well all in all i give it 1 for the interesting setting and 1 for the zombies br br watch this movie only if you like young adults <UNK> and throwing things at each other and sadly there really isn't anything funny about the whole thing so watching for a laugh would probably fail unless you're high on some kind of <UNK> drug
<START> just went on youtube and finally watched this oscar nominated animated short directed by richard i had previously watched his funny getting started there in this one a couple are playing <UNK> the wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but <UNK> on his side the wife leaves for a while to <UNK> her bed and <UNK> before catching her husband looking at her side briefly before this the husband catches a tv show called <UNK> for teens with the stars <UNK> something and the husband getting his own saw that program gets interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war happening the <UNK> is a <UNK> here as everyone <UNK> outside though the husband fell asleep during this time and thinks a parade is going on as he and his wife continue arguing about the game there's plenty of other bizarre things going on before the touching ending comes on quite hilarious and well worth seeing for any animation buff out there can't wait to see any more animated shorts from mr
<START> i was subjected to this terrible excuse for a made for tv movie i only watched it because i don't have cable and my only other choices were golf college basketball or local news the plot is very generic and has no substance that i could see not to mention it had a major flaw in my eyes the main character dr is a washed up <UNK> who believes that an <UNK> named nemesis will strike earth causing all life to <UNK> he <UNK> his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an i'm sure i spelled that one wrong the paintings show an apparent <UNK> showing significant events throughout history such as the building of the great wall of china all of the events are shown in perfect <UNK> order and the very last picture on the <UNK> is earth being destroyed now to me if the painting showed things that had indeed happened why would the great doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen all that aside the movie moved along with extreme formulaic <UNK> there was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all the actors were not very good and on a few occasions i just felt that they didn't even take the movie seriously to put forth enough effort to try to convince me that the characters were worth caring about the whole movie was cliche ridden and a downright waste of time and money i'd recommend <UNK> over this piece of crap any day at least <UNK> has some good acting compared to this not to mention the eye candy that is <UNK> tyler now that i think about it golf isn't that bad
<START> this movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time in the first 10 minutes i was already annoyed as i am familiar with the real version on the story according to the <UNK> 5 books of <UNK> but i decided to watch it to get my <UNK> worth and too see how bad it sucked well it sucked way more then i thought it would first and for most lets start with the script and characters the <UNK> that makes up the body of a movie if you study <UNK> at all you'll see that the story is all wrong here are some of the mistakes <UNK> doesn't do slave work because he was in the tribe of <UNK> <UNK> doesn't kill anybody at <UNK> but yet the movie depicts <UNK> being whipped and aaron and himself killing people not when <UNK> speaks to the burning bush he knows who hes speaking too but the movie makes <UNK> look like an idiot he states that he doesn't know who the g d in the bush is whatever aaron his brother well regardless of their distance growing up aaron was known for his calm composed peaceful nature but yet he is depicted as angry and arrogant in this movie <UNK> looks like jesus in this movie how ridiculous <UNK> the real one was actually and ugly dwarf who sat upon a <UNK> of stairs so he could appear bigger then he was and <UNK> was more then 10 feet and in the movie <UNK> is <UNK> then him and hes hot with light eyes the woman of am israel nation of israel covered themselves meaning their hair and bodies and they didn't dance or sing in front of men they did not participate in the golden <UNK> so they would definitely not dance with a man in public as the movie depicts wife was married to <UNK> and she therefore covered herself and being as humble as they were did not <UNK> or hold hands in public daughter the one who <UNK> him and saves him from the water actual converted to <UNK> and therefore would have been proud of <UNK> when he said he was going to go free his people fast <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> comes down the 2nd time with two sets of with <UNK> writing on it at least put the writing in the holy tongue <UNK> or english and put it on one <UNK> not two sets bottom line is the movie is horribly written directed and the characters are all wrong basically everything is wrong about the movie the old one is inaccurate as well but its more realistic and they actors are believable am israel <UNK>
<START> i really enjoyed the first film and when it turned up again without thinking or checking i took a family of friends to see it i was ashamed that i had <UNK> so much about it to them br br disney <UNK> the original film just like the human body <UNK> a delicious meal takes in something good and turns out well you know and by having a dark skinned person as the fbi man the results of <UNK> the <UNK> were subdued br br taken as an isolated film i suppose it is not too bad if one likes that weird sort of thing but when one has read the book or seen the first film horrible
<START> i saw this documentary film at the 2005 independent film festival this documentary is shot directed and edited by a son craig of his mother's year long battle with cancer shot over the course of one year the closer she gets is a documentary in the <UNK> form and gives you an inside look of a family's struggle with battling with the cancer the viewer gets an inside point of view of the effects cancer has on a family as well as the individual throughout the entire process i have never seen such an honest film this is a powerful and raw film and since it wasn't shot by an <UNK> you get the true emotions of everyone involved many documentaries are shot by an <UNK> but having this story told by the son adds another emotional level to the film unlike any i have seen before on this subject or any other this is a touching story that everyone should see and can relate to i would highly recommend it
<START> <UNK> was excellent company was just as good but more polished probably <UNK> to the money earned from previous movies <UNK> <UNK> however is even more entertaining the dialogue is gritty crude and at times hilarious <UNK> shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented direction is tight and the story <UNK> at a satisfying pace with a very <UNK> climax as a depiction of reality it may be over <UNK> but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot on i've ordered my dvd and can't wait to see it again at home as a lover of these type of gangster flicks this is very <UNK> and comes highly recommended for the <UNK> non <UNK> raj bollywood gangster flick lovers out there
<START> i thought this movie was awful i understand it was shot on a small budget but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain dumb the plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron in fact all of the characters were unsympathetic and none were fully developed at all the audience relates to no one in the movie it was supposed to be suspenseful but if you don't care about the characters it's hard to get into the movie at all i felt like an <UNK> being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story all the plot twists at the end were just a little too much i was actually laughing when i guess i was supposed to be shocked all in all i thought it was really just a bad movie
<START> i have no <UNK> with how the movie does not capture new jersey like <UNK> i'm from there fine whatever i lived there way long enough i don't need to see a movie that captures the garden state br br what i do have <UNK> with is how bad this movie is let's make it easy on you we'll use some bullet points there are probably some spoilers that follow not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie anyway br br the music placement was <UNK> forced and <UNK> example large what are you listening to sam the <UNK> ever heard of 'em no listen to this song it will change your life and then they proceed to play that <UNK> song that was in a <UNK> commercial don't you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you the viewer how to react to something i love that hey they should have put subtitles during various scenes <UNK> us to chuckle say cry feel inspired etc br br the scenes were so bad so cliché so melodramatic example the entire movie but no really example they're in the rainy <UNK> by the <UNK> large runs up in the <UNK> rain oh he's so tormented on top of a piece of heavy <UNK> and screams oh how moving but wait here comes sam and his buddy the annoying drug addict and they all scream but wait oh my god here it comes they kiss long deep in the rain br br the dialogue was so bad so cliché so melodramatic example they're leaving the <UNK> and sam says something like hey good luck exploring the <UNK> <UNK> and the guy says back you too oh oh my i never realized could it be oh my god it is <UNK> life is like <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> another example large and sam in the airport sam says something like is this goodbye not enough for ya ok says something like this isn't a period at the end of the sentence it's an <UNK> and guess what happens when he tries to walk down the and go back to his life in la you know what don't guess it's a waste of your time br br it's a grade z wes anderson rip off movie when not busy being melodramatic and cliché the movie spends lots of times with crazy <UNK> off <UNK> characters hey <UNK> brother thank you <UNK> for including him because it really made the movie so much more <UNK> also ripping off anderson the dialogue scene sam and are in a bar in walks friends <UNK> says one of them then they see him sitting with sam so one of the friends says sorry i said <UNK> and sam says it's ok br br inventive cinematography that's not inventive but pointless and annoying give me a break with the speed up slow down of film again wes anderson does it effectively in his movies and it was done well in <UNK> <UNK> but really it was pointless wow a crazy party where people are taking x and <UNK> coke better roll out all the tricks br br you can count the good moments on one hand even if you're missing fingers that's what makes it even worse the retarded <UNK> thing well that was good the little thing he says as they're about to enter the <UNK> something about <UNK> <UNK> that was good oh wait that's about it br br you know <UNK> is i think always a little too cute but he's likable but man this is forced pretentious melodramatic have you gotten that yet overly cute overly everything this movie is terrible apparently i'm <UNK> as this waste of time is currently rated an 8 0 br br please though if you're looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique do not rent this movie
<START> oh my god this movie is incredible it's the <UNK> movie ever and i know what i am talking about i am a scary movies fan br br the story is totally silly a group of adults decide to make a party and a silly guy with an awful mask comes and kills everybody the dialogs are a kind of parody worst they're just talking about sex with a so bad accent the end is oh discover by yourself you will be really really surprised not possible yes it is and surprise the movie is just not possible <UNK> yes it is worst than house iv and howling v br br to put it in a nutshell forget it forever
<START> <UNK> realizes a big <UNK> is coming but no one will listen whats worse is his father in law had predicted the <UNK> tokyo disaster and he's been called <UNK> to be his <UNK> of course the big one comes and tokyo is knocked flat br br a poorly dubbed japanese film that is pure soap opera for the first half the second half after the <UNK> destroys a model city its an escape drama there are some nice moments but the film wastes them either by <UNK> the action by too many poor <UNK> or by having people do unreal things hokey and not very good it has an ending you won't believe
<START> this movie makes you think it shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress <UNK> i think that women might think about this behavior but i don't think they act on it the dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden i was <UNK> when the prisoners escaped i was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution but it did not maybe that is more realistic life seems to run in the same direction instead of creating a new river bed running up hill
<START> first of all i think the casting and acting were excellent the problem is the story there is basically no story here worth telling and thus basically no movie here larry has done <UNK> <UNK> and i can't fault the original though it probably didn't need sequels he did <UNK> with paul newman which is one of my favorite movies is supposed to be a country singer but the only song i hear him sing is an old buck <UNK> song the movie makes a big deal out of chicken <UNK> character has a good wife and it's utterly stupid of him to stray from her the incident with riding in the <UNK> cage is utterly stupid maybe people do that for fun in some parts of the country but i never heard of it
<START> looking all of <UNK> years old rob lowe is a detective in charge of a murder investigation br br when the husband of a society woman leslie hope is found dead police suspect the rich chick might have something to do with it enter rob who immediately falls for the pretty widow even though he claims that he's just trying to be rob is such a good cop he is able to sneak some of her <UNK> love letters into his coat pocket before he accidentally throws them into the <UNK> monotonous murky drama with an endless <UNK> of background music br br this is a good substitute sleeping <UNK> if you've run out of
<START> this light <UNK> for cassavetes love story is pleasantly conveyed by two wonderful performances by gena rowlands and seymour <UNK> rowlands was never more beautiful as a repressed damaged mid 30's woman who meets her match in seymour <UNK> is a of energy and romantic notions on his terms br br there is a great supporting performance by val <UNK> as swift and an unusual as always timothy carey that's worth the price of admission made between husbands and a woman under the influence this is most accessible film that should touch the heart of anyone especially the cassavetes <UNK> who claim his films are too long and <UNK> heavy at times made my top ten that year and not seen by enough people an 8 out of 10
<START> terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit through every aspect being awful br br the combined talents of top actors kevin bacon and gary <UNK> are totally wasted and though they give good performances one wonders why they bothered the script from mark <UNK> is a complete mess and martin campbell has the narrative jumping all over the place but if you're unable to follow it take it as a <UNK> there are far too many pointless crazy scenes that just don't make sense jerry <UNK> music is not much help either br br even if there was potential in the plot director <UNK> approach has utterly ruined it avoid at all costs br br monday <UNK> 26 1996 video
<START> the girl in <UNK> lane 3 out of 10 <UNK> subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon plenty of <UNK> have come out of film schools about the hidden <UNK> in such films as top gun and <UNK> the girl in lane certainly fits the <UNK> <UNK> in fact it is so blatant and over the top even mst3k whom rarely notes such things in their <UNK> simply cannot avoid it br br the film is about two <UNK> one a rich kid <UNK> brown running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street <UNK> the other is a professional <UNK> brett <UNK> the <UNK> saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town <UNK> of a diner a pool hall and a <UNK> our drifter <UNK> gets a second look from the waitress <UNK> meadows as the titular girl in lovers lane who clearly is past the age of being and whose only other <UNK> is creepy jack <UNK> doing a steve <UNK> impression br br on the surface this seems like a strange film for the mst3k treatment while the cast are to old for the characters they are playing the acting is actually pretty good with both brett <UNK> and jack <UNK> giving solid performances the story is slight but hardly the robot vs aztec mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot but relatively competent br br it is the strange batman and his ward homosexual <UNK> that make this film both awful and hilarious over the top <UNK> to the kids attempts to get laid in the <UNK> are hilarious his inability to commit to the waitress or at the least get past first base are telling and the dozens of <UNK> between him and the kid a hand on shoulder the sleeping <UNK> blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can <UNK> each other you have to be <UNK> to figure out this <UNK>
<START> okay i like to give the benefit of the doubt i watched his show br br it isn't funny to me all i remember was a lot of weird noises and yelling i don't think i even <UNK> a smile the only thing that somewhat <UNK> humour was his jolie jennifer aniston bit i think you can get dumber by the minute watching it though br br also what's with the ask <UNK> section is that a ripoff of ask a gay dude black man from <UNK> show isn't it that obvious but when did it he was exposing the ignorance of the subject like <UNK> but what's up with picking random white people and yelling stuff at them that's not funny its just plain dumb br br and i'm pretty sure i heard certain jokes of his somewhere else it seems like he's bits pieces throwing in some loud yelling br br anyway it wasn't funny seriously don't even waste your time
<START> it's <UNK> a studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen after <UNK> pie throwing and the <UNK> cops his dream comes true being completely absorbed in his film making however he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man several over budget <UNK> later he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down <UNK> tin tin fortunately for him the loyal and compassionate residents of hollywood are <UNK> by ambition and ego he'll be okay as long as he still has his friends br br this movie starts out as a mad cap comedy typical of the time period and in the opening scenes it holds its own with the best of them it has a playful lack of self consciousness which is sorely missing in most of today's comedies shortly into the film however it moves away from this mode of comedy and instead attempts to entertain us using the films within the film these are silent slapstick comedies well done but nothing out of the ordinary and they go on for much longer than is necessary for any audience which has seen the originals upon returning the film takes a dramatic turn it's well written and the cast does an excellent job of making the transition but the movie really should have decided from the beginning what it was going to be br br by the end of the film it has transformed once again this time into a <UNK> to the <UNK> of hollywood the small town of los angeles has grown up into the city which makes the movies that entertain the whole world br br in spite of its promising <UNK> this film has not aged particularly well nevertheless it does have some strong scenes a certain nostalgic appeal and an entertaining sub text about the people who made it and the audiences it was made for
<START> 1st watched 1 1 2003 3 out of 10 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sober drama about a well to do doctor who gets into trouble carrying on a relationship with a younger woman whom his family brings in to live with them as well as being married to another in the same household his searching for happiness is not clear but they do bring out the reason for his <UNK> rather well by displaying the overbearing <UNK> of the females in his wife's line well played but predictable drama
<START> this is a classic <UNK> to <UNK> the likewise excellent film with juliet <UNK> as a main star moreover she is a cameo appearance here in <UNK> just for a second at the very end but this film truly red and very sweet although very sad is a real winner the main heroine played by ever great irene is a successful photo fashion model she leads a full active life only <UNK> by her traumatic relations with her weird friend mike who is in england by some lucky chance she gets friendly with the old judge who spends time listening to the private <UNK> talks of his neighbors the story starts to <UNK> even further and we see him in court being almost universally condemned for his <UNK> she is the only one who feels sympathy for him for his cute <UNK> rita and her <UNK> and for all the people who surround them we also witness the break up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady and their <UNK> is also <UNK> by that <UNK> scandal but the film is not about this even it is mostly about the loneliness and deep <UNK> between people far and near when she <UNK> to england on a ferry with that lawyer as a chance fellow passenger as well as that earlier mentioned <UNK> who starred in <UNK> the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived she did and still we feel very heavy at heart mr managed to draw a grand subtle story about the <UNK> <UNK> secrets and pain deep dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely brilliant film
<START> when i first saw the trailer for the <UNK> it looked absolutely horrible and i had no interest in seeing it but when it came out on dvd today i figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest i would rent it and give it a shot i watched it and it really wasn't that bad i think it was immature and stupid at times but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh i don't really watch many sports movies so i wonder maybe if i saw more maybe this movie would make more sense to me but it's all good i still didn't mind so much watching the <UNK> i admit these stupid spoof movies are lame but what's the harm in a stupid joke every once in a while the <UNK> isn't really that bad if you give it a fair chance br br coach fields is failing in life family and career both but when he is offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a <UNK> football team into the championship but the team is really really terrible like beyond terrible but with a little work and team effort they try to give it their all even though that might turn into something more sad br br the <UNK> over all isn't the worst film i've seen i think it's good for a couple laughs and <UNK> i know that this was stupid but i couldn't help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and he's beating the <UNK> head against the locker just him and the nerd in general were so funny together if you have an open mind and don't take this movie too seriously i think you'll have a fun time watching it if you watch it expecting it to be oscar worthy material this is not the movie for you br br 4 10
<START> this movie was shot using a digital camera and it shows there were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer also with the help of a terrible score as if that weren't enough the acting was also terrible now in hartley's movies the acting is always peculiar but here it was just bad especially by satan thomas jay ryan and harvey who thank god doesn't get to say much after all these <UNK> problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good either the jokes are predictable and unbelievably straightforward and the events just <UNK> on from one incident to the next the so called book of life with <UNK> inside isn't much more than an excuse to see actors struggle to say their lines all in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort thumbs down
<START> oh dear this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen it's unbelievably repetitive every scene seems to consist of people being <UNK> down running round screaming or being kicked in the face which quickly becomes very dull i wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good but it isn't the main character phillips pushes the various <UNK> over with ridiculous ease and no matter how often he stands in full view of the <UNK> he never gets hit even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him i've rarely seen a worse cast of actors especially don wilson if you can even call him an actor but that's not really surprising given the dialogue they have to work with <UNK> line computers killed my brother the plot is a sub par ripoff of the excellent terminator the special effects are laughable overall this film is just utterly dreadful and why does everything explode
<START> i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels from production to plot and character development br br this definitely fall under the realism genre since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination twists or <UNK> audience in how a viewer shall feel think and <UNK> br br the actors are great especially the little ones the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing maybe not even as common as should be in real life it is a movie excellent to literally watch while <UNK> it one knows when a movie is good when one just does not want it to end but eventually everything does
<START> detective <UNK> vince de <UNK> james and company are on the case of a vicious serial killer rapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become the killer's next victim and what is with the killer's hilarious white dude <UNK> br br inspired by the case of serial killer ted <UNK> killer's delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from 1978 that doesn't offer much if anything it's more of a police <UNK> flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get <UNK> bodies but we don't get a whole lot in the exploitation department especially considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the <UNK> murders or maniac will be very disappointed br br fortunately there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that <UNK> the tone right and is quite suspenseful to boot also john is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious <UNK> white guys with <UNK> are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distracting br br the dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the standards of the time those looking for a better example should probably turn to don't go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesn't cut it
<START> the first <UNK> 1 but here's the review of <UNK> 2 br br contains spoilers so beware readers br br oh my oh my my my i'll start off with telling you that i had no hopes in the least bit that this movie would be good considering that <UNK> the first movie is without a doubt the worst movie ever made the sequel didn't have much promise br br as expected it didn't deliver br br the deaths were even <UNK> than in the first movie there was absolutely no eye candy whatsoever and every single prop looked so fake that i wouldn't be surprised if they had a <UNK> class make them br br look i don't even know where to begin <UNK> for starters the movie wasn't even feature length it was only an hour and eight minutes long <UNK> min but then again ending it early was actually a <UNK> in fact that's the only reason that this movie wasn't as bad as the first because the first was longer br br usually i don't give spoilers in reviews but since i don't want any of you to go through the torture of watching this waste of film i'm going to spoil away not that there's much to spoil br br let's start with the ending <UNK> is the killer ever it takes explosions <UNK> guns etc to kill all of the normal serial killers in horror movies guess what it took to kill <UNK> a f ing glass of water no lie in the end a girl picked up a cup of water and threw the water on face then <UNK> started screaming and they tried to make it look like his face was melting by putting <UNK> rubber <UNK> on his <UNK> then he laid there and the people went to sleep br br now let's hit the acting very terrible not even one person was believable in the least bit i don't even know what to say other than it looks like they just hired a few <UNK> living on the streets to act in this film br br seriously i honestly doubt that they spent any more than 100 dollars total to make this movie they had nothing most of it took place in the woods which wouldn't have cost them anything to film on the actors weren't giving in any effort whatsoever so it's blatant that they were probably working for free they didn't have any kind of special effects or nice props and they probably used <UNK> for the blood hell who am i kidding they probably didn't even spend 100 dollars they probably spent 3 <UNK> on a bottle of <UNK> and that was it a f <UNK> movie made with a budget of 3 <UNK> br br for <UNK> sake they couldn't even afford to rent a cop uniform in the end after <UNK> dies the girl wakes up and says where is he and the main woman replies he's gone then suddenly some fat goofy guy with <UNK> on his face pops out of nowhere with a cell phone saying you have a phone call the girl answers and says oh hi mom and smiles then the fat goofy guy walks along to reveal that it's a police officer however he's wearing <UNK> pants and a regular button up green shirt with a lame <UNK> on the front pocket hell it was probably the <UNK> that the director got when he was in safety <UNK> in 3rd grade then they all got into a <UNK> <UNK> and drove off as the credits rolled they couldn't even get a police <UNK> so they just got a <UNK> <UNK> f <UNK> lame <UNK> didn't even have the ice cream van that he had in the first movie br br <UNK> is without a doubt the most <UNK> gay slasher ever if there was a slasher that wore hot pink <UNK> and carried a <UNK> flag he still would not be as gay as <UNK> <UNK> isn't funny either and believe me he did try to be br br the only good thing about this movie is an extremely lame threat given by one of the <UNK> somebody makes a comment to some boy about not passing third grade to which the boy responds i'll show you third grade in a threatening manner that has to be the absolute worst threat that i've ever heard i'll show you third grade br br this movie doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level it's filth unless you did something bad and you are feeling so guilty about it that you want to <UNK> yourself severely don't watch this movie br br just remember if a <UNK> homosexual clown with a huge black <UNK> tries to bore you to death with gay jokes and attempt to kill you at the same time just throw some water at him case closed br br final rating 1 out of 10
<START> as long as you can get past your <UNK> instincts and realize that are people too you'll realize the depth p t anderson gives to his characters also an incredible soundtrack the songs are so tightly tied to their scenes you won't be able to hear them without thinking about the movie again br br philip seymour hoffman is worth the price of admission alone
<START> director lead actor <UNK> in this look at me film <UNK> he attempts to gain <UNK> acceptance for the otherwise very upbeat world of mormon <UNK> some of the acting is fair but some roles are unrealistic i e the ominous rather than <UNK> mission president etc the film does give a fair look at how some <UNK> may struggle with their faith but the actual <UNK> program he claims to represent is far from his concept of it in terms of being upbeat cohesive and inspired the only inspiration i see in this film is self inspiration the film is slow and boring and the shooting and screenplay look like a college student project
<START> while the date doctor concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre i found it enjoyable enough to elevate my opinion of it so i ended up liking it a lot more than if it'd had just a mediocre plot without many twists will smith does a great job as always acting as <UNK> the man who <UNK> his life to <UNK> men how and how not to win over women ever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend <UNK> plenty of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient overweight <UNK> <UNK> albert kevin james successfully court beautiful co worker cole <UNK> also when he decides to rid a woman he meets in a bar of the turkey who just doesn't seem to get she doesn't want him around he finds himself attracted to sara eva <UNK> it appears to be a big deal for him so i guess since college he never actually <UNK> his own rules on himself unfortunately sara is a <UNK> <UNK> who is interested in the date doctor who got a seemingly <UNK> guy like albert together with especially after player jerk vance <UNK> jeffrey <UNK> breaks her best friend's julie ann <UNK> heart and hints the date doctor he saw disgusted him when she doesn't realize that he refused to see him still trouble follows and <UNK> is stuck left wondering about what to do with his own relationship while not being any great help to albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his the acting is good there's a great deal of humor and some other fine points with meaning <UNK> character is witty and wise sometimes managing to be both at once true the <UNK> where the woman is at something the man hasn't truly done why do they always show that as common and irritating guess it wouldn't have been if it was the 1st not <UNK> time i've seen it but the rest of them were completely new i only wish this movie was longer i remember being able to watch 3 5 of it while it was playing on a <UNK> tv once but i still <UNK> it's definitely worth the money to pay for its <UNK>
<START> i recall so many things about seeing this movie back during it's original theatrical release the post <UNK> <UNK> of peace and love along with the pre <UNK> tension of fear and paranoia it's hard to believe that it's thirty seven years later and i can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend like <UNK> at peter <UNK> characterization of the ultimate redneck sure to <UNK> him the rest of his career oh how wrong and how the counter culture <UNK> the sensibilities of most of the country to this day my buddy and i still use joe line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades br br it's curious to read comments about the film from others on this board particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were still if you were around during that time the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar <UNK> that existed back then pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal if you really want dated when was the last time you heard the words <UNK> and in the same sentence or a line like <UNK> come on get with the <UNK> generation for historical perspective you have that great <UNK> poster lingering in one of the background scenes would you buy a used car from this man with minor <UNK> like those director john captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago br br today's viewing was only the second time i've seen the movie and i have to admit i don't remember susan sarandon in one of the lead roles but then again this was her very first picture the scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time shocking in fact as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the <UNK> of <UNK> and convention joe took a major leap in that regard particularly since it was a <UNK> picture br br with the passage of time the thing that <UNK> me the most about peter boyle was how he <UNK> the stereotype of joe to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work i mean how do you go from joe to that hilarious rendition of on the in young frankenstein and my absolute favorite episode of <UNK> <UNK> has boyle as clyde in both a tender and tragic funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on <UNK> and <UNK> more than once and as a career <UNK> frank <UNK> has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television even repeat episodes in <UNK> are funny as he whenever the elder <UNK> lets loose with one of his observations he is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already
<START> i was hoping this would be a good weekly vehicle for tim <UNK> one of my all time favorite performers alas and it is not there doesn't seem to be any chemistry between anyone on the show the dialogue is decidedly uninspired and even the laugh track appeared to be brutal
<START> shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids this movie centers around some freak named <UNK> <UNK> recently <UNK> revealed to us by an arguing <UNK> board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time runs <UNK> at the local <UNK> by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth br br <UNK> runs to farm where he eats a guy steals a car ties up an old woman and gets chased and gets killed oh and the chick from the tv show gets naked
<START> today you die starts as <UNK> criminal <UNK> banks producer steven seagal is hired by sinister businessman max stevens kevin <UNK> to drive a security vehicle with 20 000 000 of cash in the back from point <UNK> a las vegas casino to point <UNK> him sounds simple right well what max forgot to tell <UNK> that the money is stolen that he has just become the <UNK> driver in an armed robbery <UNK> things get even worse for <UNK> when the local cops catch him chuck him in prison for a long time however <UNK> managed to hide the money before he was caught with a nice 20 000 000 at stake <UNK> for <UNK> has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do government agents <UNK> teams up with ice <UNK> anthony <UNK> in prison they both manage to escape at which point <UNK> goes looking for some revenge br br photographed directed by don e one has to say that the shot in eastern europe straight to video action films that steven seagal <UNK> in these days aren't getting any better today you die is a good case in point this is a terrible film simple as that really the script by producer danny <UNK> kevin moore les gives seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around that of a criminal rather than some government agent cop soldier one man army cliché he usually plays in fact if you were being <UNK> you could say today you die is a rip off of mel <UNK> excellent thriller <UNK> 1998 where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect while <UNK> was a superb <UNK> hard edged film noir type action thriller today you die isn't <UNK> into <UNK> by comparison unfortunately here seagal is terrible he has no on screen presence or menace either the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not for instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day robin hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers <UNK> to give to the poor as well as keeping a <UNK> profit for himself which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has seagal turn around murder a lot of people which <UNK> the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such <UNK> to set up in the first place the story is full of holes for instance agent <UNK> is <UNK> by the on the run <UNK> is then <UNK> by her bent superior for meeting him it turns out that he found out by <UNK> her phone in that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch <UNK> the story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating government agent is actually a bad guy wow i didn't see that coming i must say br br director slows everything down to a <UNK> pace today you die feels like it goes on forever the action scenes set pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value the <UNK> fight scenes aren't great most are either shot in shadow very quickly cut edited or with the camera played behind <UNK> character to try disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double again seagal looks fat out of shape uses long <UNK> <UNK> to try hide it it doesn't there's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of las vegas in this at the start i thought that today you die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called top of the world 1997 which is about a las vegas casino robbery as well as using footage from that film today you die also edits scenes from the charlie sheen action film no code of conduct 1998 the jean claude van damme action film the order 2001 the wesley snipes prison based action film <UNK> 2002 so quite how much of today you die is original footage is anyone's guess br br technically the film is alright considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent consistent enough all the footage of the us locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in <UNK> the rap style music that <UNK> today you die is awful by the way the acting is poor seagal just <UNK> his way through his lines as usual br br today you die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films seagal looks old fat the action scenes are average at best most of the story is fairly random it doesn't come together at the end that well at all one to avoid unless your a die hard seagal fan if such an animal even exists
<START> bank heist cop thriller sounds ok right br br chaos looks good nicely framed good production values high concept action heist br br but br br the plot has the unique achievement of being both smart and blatantly implausible in the how we actually got the money mode and in the who done it and why section at the same time br br in ryan <UNK> shouting is not seriously not either tough or scary and he is especially not tough or scary when throwing a <UNK> fit honestly his great <UNK> is the only really funny scene in the whole film must make him thrilled that he turned down the role of <UNK> skywalker and is now doing this br br <UNK> is normally good as the tough but silent hard nut with the self <UNK> humor but here the extra relationship lines are so laughably bad that even he looks uncomfortable saying some of the clichéd <UNK> required more silent seems best br br snipes is actually ok in a <UNK> way but another nail in a talented actor's coffin he needs an actor's role not an action hero rehash perhaps that business with his <UNK> will allow him to break that mold and the public and critics will let him on the sympathy vote it would be good if he wasn't so <UNK> all the time br br the lines these guys speak when they're not doing the plot development and detective work can be summed up in one word br br the film feels all out of <UNK> and it never <UNK> i found it irritating for the first 45 minutes and the <UNK> last part was passable it should could have been good but it just can't redeem the awful lines the overwhelming score and the general level of <UNK> with the levels of <UNK> br br overall i nearly didn't make it through incredibly irritating and ryan please please please get rid of the
<START> forget the over rated batman begins this is the ultimate batman movie that you are not gonna want to miss out on this movie has everything and it totally surpasses the first 1989 mega hit it may not have done as well as the first one in at the box office but this is certainly a much better film the visuals are amazing burton works his magic as he always does in his films once again <UNK> city <UNK> hunting ground is an amazing sight to behold the story itself is actually quite good and the 2 villains in this one are very interesting much more interesting in fact then there comic book counterparts tim burton and screenplay writer daniel <UNK> go a step further to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters the penguin played to perfection by danny <UNK> is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge on the world that denied him very disgusting to watch at times but he has some of the most classic lines a villain could ever utter in a single film the other villain is <UNK> played so absolutely brilliantly by michelle <UNK> one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and gives a wow performance and totally steals the show as far any of the past and present live action batman <UNK> is concerned she also has a tragic background her name is <UNK> kyle and she is a very put upon <UNK> secretary for a <UNK> business man called max who later murders her by <UNK> her out a window somehow she survives and is <UNK> by cats and decides right then and there to become the legendary <UNK> not before of course the amazing sequence in which she completely lets loose and <UNK> her entire apartment in one of the most oscar worthy of rage and anger i have ever seen in an actress br br michael keaton once again <UNK> the cape and <UNK> as batman and also as bruce wayne and this time hes much darker there's not much else to say here except that keaton is simply the best actor to play batman ever he just <UNK> cool and he has a kind of clint eastwood approach to playing batman and he is very dark he doesn't talk a lot and when he does he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound all goofy and fake ie <UNK> batman voice in batman begins he <UNK> around <UNK> like a man possessed by his own inner demons he's disturbed and you know it in this outing he takes on 2 of the most famous baddies to ever grace the batman comic book world br br i have to say though despite the <UNK> of the action scenes like the scenes with the coolest <UNK> ever racing down the street knocking thugs to the ground and batman <UNK> across <UNK> its the romantic angle between <UNK> and keaton that really makes this movie classic a top choice for anyone who wants to see the real batman in action i rate this a 10 would give it more if i could
<START> <UNK> sick love is a really remarkable documentary made for hbo about two <UNK> of heroin addicted lovers <UNK> the streets of nyc i managed to catch it one night by accident and found it absolutely mesmerizing there is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects the camera just follows them around like a third eye completely detached the people being followed don't even seem aware that they're being filmed or at least they don't seem to care the footage is amazingly <UNK> some of the most <UNK> i've ever seen this is as real as it gets the nuts and <UNK> of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin we watch them score <UNK> shoot it make up <UNK> and even <UNK> cops to rob people and about a million other tiny details that less <UNK> documentary filmmakers would leave out br br some of the footage is truly horrifying like watching one guy <UNK> searching for fix he lost i found myself praying that he would find it just so that his misery would <UNK> end and when he does find it the guy literally dances in the street br br the <UNK> nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this everything is about getting the next score to these folks yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through br br i would love to get a copy of this if anyone knows where it is available highly recommended if you can catch it on hbo
<START> a story about love and hate tragedy and happiness and most of all friendship set in the very interesting time of the american civil war br br gets you interested in history gets you emotionally involved and makes you <UNK> wait for the next episode br br moreover the casting was splendid many <UNK> appear in short cameos the leading roles are played by a big array of talented <UNK> <UNK> alley and <UNK> <UNK> should be mentioned here this is simply a superb example for a tv production as it should be br br not to forget the sheer <UNK> of wendy portraying <UNK>
<START> you know i really hate <UNK> <UNK> system since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the <UNK> but here we go editing time br br holy is this bad i thought it might be a cool little movie judging by the plot summary since i've <UNK> rented such gems as <UNK> and american nightmare before but this is just it's about a killer who uses edgar allen <UNK> works as reference for his murderous exploits and the story of a detective who has to stop him can't these <UNK> <UNK> make a good movie without <UNK> the grave of a great horror writer i mean the kills in here are completely devoid of thought or originality and the references to poe are hokey and fake without enough thought put into them they're shallow and they put <UNK> work to shame full of holes with awful <UNK> the acting is bad too reminding me of the abortion that was known in some third world countries as fear x what with all the <UNK> and un emotional lines br br i realize this is an indie movie but that's no excuse i've seen high school kids act better then these morons and i myself could've come up with better kill scenes and a better plot given ample time br br this has no reason to exist avoid at all costs
<START> see no evil with kane the movie has a great storyline but it just wasn't a hide my <UNK> scream out loud horror flick i thought it was going to be from watching the wwe <UNK> on monday night raw when the movie first came to theaters i did enjoy the movie though i loved the story it played out br br great movie excellent would like to see a part 2 br br it doesn't matter if kane gets killed at the end br br or not they have killed off other horror stars in every movie br br they have out and they still comeback for more so a part 2 would br br be very interesting
<START> i'm sorry guys all who thought this film could be something great i'm afraid you would be disappointed br br the standard the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot so simple that the movie is not <UNK> until the end i asked myself if the plot wasn't about the action but about the main character played by mickey rourke but i found that the character was inconsistent either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother but both don't go together because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself now joseph gordon <UNK> is a good looking actor but he played his character a little unnatural i didn't believe his acting it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldn't provide and he didn't have to because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough the only one whose acting was great was diane lane if not her i would give this movie 1 star br br in conclusion i expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot and i completely blew it with my high expectations
<START> i wish i could have met <UNK> <UNK> when people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner well for me one person would be her i think she is now one of the great <UNK> and personalities in the film industry her life story would make a great <UNK> movie hey mr bogdanovich <UNK> <UNK> has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s i can remember being <UNK> at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly <UNK> film is the late 70s she was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink ugh i should have <UNK> her then as she died not long after more from the part than the worm too from high <UNK> <UNK> and the extraordinary rko thriller on dangerous ground <UNK> <UNK> was often the producer and the lead actress later with her husband howard duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today one of them is jennifer which i think is the last film with a <UNK> pictures <UNK> <UNK> changed the company name <UNK> to allied artists in 1953 and jennifer has both company names on the opening credits this is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both the <UNK> and the haunting made 8 years later really chilling and very creepy this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film <UNK> <UNK> made and was responsible for try and find it you will always remember it and as i feel much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress producer
<START> the last good ernest movie and the best at that how can you not laugh at least once at this movie the last line is a classic as is <UNK> gangster impressions his best moment on film this has his best lines and is a <UNK> achievement among the brainless screwball comedies
<START> i just finished watching this film and think it is one of the worst films i have ever seen it was so boring that i found myself <UNK> through it at <UNK> speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes i was not just disappointed but angry that i had wasted my money to rent it it ranks within the top five of the worst films i have ever seen and i've seen thousands of movies the plot was very confusing had i not first read the dvd <UNK> cover prior to renting it i would have been totally lost throughout this film i would not have thought that tim robbins after having made such good films as <UNK> redemption would have agreed to appear in this film
<START> i was a child when i saw this serial a bit after seen buck rogers one both characters performed by the same buster <UNK> and i must acknowledge that these films have always been part of the best entertainment i've ever had the fight against emperor <UNK> was one thing but i was more interested to know about the final fate of the love triangle of flash with <UNK> and aura came and <UNK> aura to forget flash very innocent <UNK> of her obsession for good looking flash the serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences another thing is that i learned floating in water looking the way <UNK> did it when fighting against shark men the soundtrack was also nice although it was used previously in another film of boris <UNK> frankenstein it would be nice to have the dvd of this serial provided that it comes with subtitles in spanish not yet available
<START> <UNK> 2 back in business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny the movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable back in business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot cedric the terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character overall <UNK> 2 back in business was a sequel not needed without the originals charm soul spark
<START> there is a phrase by the experimental filmmaker <UNK> who says some films are structured like a camera <UNK> on the head of a dog who goes down an alley <UNK> everything along the way br br that's how this movie is the structure is kurosawa started out as a baby then he became a kid then a young man then a movie director then he started making then he grew old the end the word <UNK> is used a lot in this film to describe <UNK> <UNK> without explaining what makes his films so good great just because the off screen narrator reading a script says that a film is a masterpiece are we supposed to kiss his rear end and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the 20th century and one more point the voice of paul <UNK> is used as the voice of kurosawa when <UNK> from the director's <UNK> are being read off screen he brings <UNK> shaped shakespearean tones to the text but why him if you were making a documentary about <UNK> holiday would you use dame <UNK> as her voice
<START> many questions <UNK> about the making of this film the first of which is why make a film that plays out as little more than an awkward female fantasy it's one thing to leave an audience with issues to discuss about a film's intent it's something entirely different to go into the process of writing a script which fails to adequately address real human issues before they are rendered on the screen br br why the outrageously melodramatic and often comical soundtrack why the excessive and frequently clunky dialogue why is the lead character's girlfriend one of the <UNK> <UNK> what purpose is there to turning the lead character's freedom from <UNK> into a joke by having him complete his mission this is a classic little aussie film moment resort to quirky comedy at the most inappropriate moment why so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens this accounts for approximately 15 minutes of the film which is at least 30 minutes too long why if a man is imprisoned for so many days does he not <UNK> to make a serious attempt at escape br br the director who co wrote the script has failed on many counts to deliver a satisfactory story br br dave <UNK> australia
<START> i just saw this on a local independent station in the new york city area the cast showed promise but when i saw the director george i became suspicious and sure enough it was every bit as bad every bit as pointless and stupid as every george movie i ever saw he's like a stupid man's michael <UNK> with all the awfulness that <UNK> promises br br there's no point to the conspiracy no burning issues that urge the <UNK> on we are left to ourselves to connect the <UNK> from one bit of <UNK> on various walls in the film to the next thus the current budget crisis the war in iraq <UNK> <UNK> the fate of social security <UNK> million americans without health care <UNK> and the death of the middle class are all <UNK> by the sheer terror of <UNK> br br a truly stunningly idiotic film
<START> this is the worst movie of all time it's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 1 3 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet if you actually watch the whole thing god help you
<START> eight <UNK> freaks is a modern monster movie like a remake of any of the old <UNK> of the giant insert animal here ' movies of the 50s 60s and 70s or rather it should have been more like a remake of the instead of what is was so how is a monster movie done in the year 2002 well from the typical opening with some chemical making the <UNK> grow to huge proportions they mix movies like <UNK> jurassic park starship troopers and flavor it with some parody like scary movie <UNK> is probably the best comparison but eight <UNK> freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like scary movie it was way too much at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie filled with jokes br br for a movie like this you don't expect much of the acting and that is just the way it was the story though was extremely thin with just a bunch of loosely connected events to show off some action mixed with all of the jokes leading up to an easily spotted and corny ending br br i rate eight <UNK> freaks a 4 10 and that includes the fact that the special effects where pretty good and that the noises the <UNK> made where hilarious
<START> this harold lloyd short wasn't really much not one of his funnier efforts of course i never see <UNK> kids as anything hilarious that's what the bulk of this story is harold and his wife mildred davis <UNK> his in laws two young kids one is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four year old terror who does everything but <UNK> the house letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me br br the best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big <UNK> <UNK> young is <UNK> their house half the time it's the pet cat <UNK> the couple but overall that segment is fun with some good sight gags reminding me of another lloyd short haunted <UNK> br br however the good ending doesn't save the whole picture which i probably wouldn't watch again lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again it just isn't that funny
<START> i'm afraid i must disagree with mr <UNK> as although he is correct in saying this isn't a comedy it has many other merits the plot is a little mad at parts but i believe it it all fits together nicely creating a satisfying enjoyable film the last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting showing just what someone will do under <UNK> circumstances br br i would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies but if you're a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don't expect expect something as deep as <UNK> then you should still find it enjoyable
<START> and what is its genre the <UNK> expose story what theatrical life is really like behind those broadway and other <UNK> it certainly has a lot of competition <UNK> in the rain both i and ii <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> street <UNK> of you name the year <UNK> of 1934 noises off 1992 from the <UNK> side and a star is born i and ii from the 1930s and the 1950s from the <UNK> side not to mention summer stock of 1950 the list keeps <UNK> along so what makes this movie so special and why are there so few comments about this stunningly great movie have so few people actually seen it how amazing to see a younger frank <UNK> pre dracula and pre frost <UNK> by 30 years how amazing to see the fresh and talented tom <UNK> so pre <UNK> and yet another superb stiller what a wonderful line up of talented people at their very best from so long ago and such a script who was this david so full of realistic <UNK> and pathos compared to the usual sentimentality and feel good comedy as especially <UNK> by the star is born like episode where the heroine achieves broadway while the <UNK> character has to content himself with still another <UNK> tour br br <UNK> subsequent hysterical and sadistic <UNK> against the star struck latin teacher and his <UNK> in which he <UNK> his fury and frustration is just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film the latin teacher and his love affair with <UNK> life certainly echo marlene <UNK> and her <UNK> professor in the blue angel of <UNK> another in the series of <UNK> and cold hearted agents like kevin mccarthy who was <UNK> by burt <UNK> in the sweet smell of success 1957 and succeeded by alan <UNK> in 2001 in movie history the sexual <UNK> of the <UNK> character recalls similar incidents in <UNK> great comedy ah wilderness br br and what a tribute to the <UNK> of long ago the red mill of victor herbert rose marie and the <UNK> king of <UNK> the desert song of <UNK> etc what satirical of bits from the great plays like romeo and juliet <UNK> to the theater itself as by the star <UNK> the <UNK> and depth of this movie are simply endless and to be <UNK> by such a title who could have an <UNK> of what this great movie is about from such a ridiculous and title but on the other hand what title could one have applied to such a magnificent drama which might have lived up to its stirring emotional content br br ps i just saw 2009 frank <UNK> in his latest acting spectacular as richard <UNK> in frost <UNK> how this great actor after 30 years simply goes from triumph to triumph
<START> bride of <UNK> starts late one night as officer bob <UNK> vince <UNK> into the evidence room at his police station amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the <UNK> doll that serial killer charles lee ray possessed way back in the original child's play 1988 he drives the remains to an isolated area where <UNK> ex girlfriend <UNK> jennifer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> throat takes the remains back to her trailer there <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> voiced by brad <UNK> back together again using a <UNK> for book brings him back to murderous life thing don't go as <UNK> had hoped <UNK> turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which <UNK> is less than happy while <UNK> takes a bath <UNK> escapes <UNK> her using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies have to work together to get to a cemetery in new jersey where <UNK> natural body had been buried with the <UNK> needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies the bodies of <UNK> <UNK> jesse nick his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who are both on the run from corrupt uncle chief of police warren <UNK> john ritter will do nicely br br directed by <UNK> <UNK> i love bride of <UNK> the script by don <UNK> is great fun very fast moving highly entertaining references plenty of other horror film with good affection from the opening sequence where we see jason <UNK> hockey mask from the friday the 13th films freddy <UNK> razor blade <UNK> from the a nightmare on elm street series michael myers mask from the halloween franchise to the clips used from bride of frankenstein <UNK> when it virtually <UNK> the same scene bride of <UNK> never takes itself seriously which is just as well there are lots of one liners self <UNK> gags that scream 1996 made trendy a few years earlier it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself the horror genre in general i love the scene when jesse <UNK> are having a clichéd <UNK> romantic conversation that <UNK> hears he makes funny <UNK> comments gestures throughout that's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is director <UNK> manages to create good atmosphere a real sense of fun both human plastic sets of characters are likable shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause technically bride of <UNK> is great for the most part has that big budget polish about it at about 25 000 000 i should hope so the only thing that i will say is that some of the puppet effects by kevin are a little stiff unconvincing i can't remember any cgi scenes in bride of <UNK> either thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood gore with a cool <UNK> throat nails <UNK> into someone's face in presumably a <UNK> 1987 homage people <UNK> on <UNK> of glass someone being <UNK> by a huge truck a ripped off lip <UNK> various <UNK> <UNK> the acting is pretty good <UNK> as <UNK> is very funny as he <UNK> the one liners out i also like the scenes with <UNK> at the beginning find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear i can't be the only one surely i personally think bride of <UNK> is a fantastic film total entertainment from start to finish great humour horror in equal measure at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull a personal favourite of mine watch it as soon as you can
<START> what do you get when you put lou diamond <UNK> todd bridges barry corbin with a bad <UNK> and an alien all on a train you get a very bad movie called alien express or dead <UNK> that would be more entertaining on comedy <UNK> old series mystery science theater 3000 you name it this awful movie suffered in areas of acting plot storyline and special effects in fact the exterior passenger train shots looked like the production staff used a common ho scale model in front of a painted background the rest of the special effects goes downhill from there br br the plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970's movies called horror express and a disaster movie called the <UNK> crossing at least the <UNK> crossing had a better cast an engaging storyline and real train scenes br br if you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a b movie party then watch this otherwise alien express <UNK> long before <UNK> from the station
<START> it is terrible it is like somebody gave a kid a <UNK> video camera and 30 and told them to make a film even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this the story is so dumb you can say there isn't one i don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director the acting is very bad really <UNK> level and the writing is just plain awful the only scene i didn't hate was the one with the <UNK> accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film how do people get <UNK> for this stuff i don't mind alternative films but shouldn't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow <UNK> i would call of amateurish if it wasn't an insult to amateurs this would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged
<START> this flick was even better then for the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and little second second city <UNK> if one finds this movie boring or pointless god help 'em they just didn't get it it is a <UNK> something at which guest and levy have a genius for at the end of the movie where <UNK> southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show he went to israel to work on a or when he tells us that is an ancient art and we see a <UNK> br br of an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in it's hand i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living thank you mr guest and mr levy and god bless you
<START> <UNK> shakespeare could be considered the first classic of the our gang <UNK> era by now hal roach studios began to hit their <UNK> in making talking pictures and shakespeare is the happy result br br the gang is appearing in a version of <UNK> <UNK> produced by kennedy the <UNK> wife the kids don't find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines among the funniest bits are kennedy the cop as the giant who pulls off his makeup to fight an <UNK> man in a bull costume and the terrible dancing girl played by director bob <UNK> daughter br br several <UNK> mention that shakespeare has the first pie fight in a <UNK> this may be true seeing as they tried different <UNK> with the film during the fight buster keaton's brother harry is at the receiving end of one of the <UNK> very funny and an early gang <UNK> classic 9 out of 10
<START> i am not a movie maker but i know it is hard to tell a story and draw people into it in only seven short minutes i think a good movie is one you don't want to end eric did a great job of developing the <UNK> of the and making him seem human loved the music and the voice used for the i am looking forward to seeing what eric has in store for us in future films this is one movie i didn't want to see end great job
<START> when a stranger calls is actually a pretty good movie i had never saw the original and so when i watched this i thought it was unique when when a stranger calls was advertised on the television the trailer gave away the ending well i never saw the trailer so when i saw this film i was surprised at how good it turned out to be i walked by it one day and decided i'd buy it and now i'm lucky i did because i thought it was a very pleasing movie that is a nice little film to own it is getting a lot of unfair treatment and if you're interested in this movie at all don't listen to all the <UNK> <UNK> belle is not as bad of an actress as everyone makes her out to be and she did a great job in this movie so all you <UNK> get over yourselves <UNK> up and actually try to enjoy this movie for what it is a fun <UNK> <UNK> popcorn flick if you haven't seen it please do for it is a lot more enjoyable than a lot of the other slashers being made recently
<START> clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an <UNK> of charles <UNK> work the <UNK> henry character in <UNK> stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in <UNK> also starring faye <UNK> anyone who has seen should certainly see to get a better look at how <UNK> wrote his character lacks the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> screenplay and the <UNK> <UNK> of his loner hero the <UNK> humor that <UNK> through in the dark desperation of <UNK> doesn't work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood <UNK> rourke <UNK> character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous <UNK> a place setting for yet another <UNK> ugly day in the life of a drunken <UNK> unknown writer <UNK> character misses these marks in favor of a <UNK> handsome relatively clean looking wanna be writer that <UNK> passes for any moment in that of story <UNK> sleazy heroine <UNK> is the perfect <UNK> to the <UNK> do well henry the women in can't hold a candle to <UNK> and the use of more <UNK> sexual subject matter in proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to <UNK> raw and <UNK> portrayals of dysfunctional relationships i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in marisa tomei buying all the stuff and <UNK> it to the old man is an exact rip off from br br if you want to see the best <UNK> stories on film see and <UNK> is a dog from <UNK> which also goes by the title <UNK>
<START> how i wondered why i hadn't seen this in theaters or even a single commercial for it and then after i saw the movie i realized i was <UNK> hardcore i am a big <UNK> fan and a big blade fan so when i saw this i imagined some killer fight scene between two lots of <UNK> a whole bunch of stuff instead i got the ryan <UNK> movie with a brief cameo by <UNK> and snipes the guy that does the audio and video in the crime lab got more screen time than wesley it was like renting a jackie chan movie expecting a bunch of kung fu and getting <UNK> i expect bad movies from hollywood but actors like snipes and <UNK> should treat the fan base better
<START> i have watched this show for a while only because of my cousins and i hate it first the girls dress in the same style clothes and they have the same first letter in their names come on i could to better than that then the villains spare me first we have a monkey with part of his little brain showing then we have a gay version of the devil a pink <UNK> a gang green gang <UNK> is ironic that's their name a spoiled princess once again ironic that's <UNK> name among others i have also found that there is no male hero in the show not that i'm sexist or anything i'd rather watch sailor moon it's much better than this if someone else wants to watch the show in the room that you're in find a way to break the television believe me it'll save you a half hour of torture br br rating i'm giving this just what it deserves a 1 out of 10 whatever you do do not watch this
<START> the greatest effort plus the finest cast ever assembled in a movie by the director tim robbins and susan sarandon and sean penn on the front row someone said that this movie is good because directed and written by tim robbins but i convince you that sean penn and susan sarandon had give me a truly superb performance that i cried my heart out their acting is so real no doubt about it that this movie is rated 4 and 3 4 out of 5
<START> good not great little horror film with a high creep factor not to be confused with a 1991 movie by the same name or the more recent 2001 <UNK> stories central tale of stranded teens telling ghost stories around a <UNK> in spooky woods nicely leads into and ties together the different stories that make up the bulk of the movie watch for ron <UNK> office space band of brothers and jennifer macdonald in a spirited sexy segment the honeymoon solid acting and a few truly scary moments make this an above average <UNK> good example of interesting story line coupled with quality ensemble acting resulting in a whole greater than the sum of its parts surprise ending of the main story adds nice creepy twist although some may see it coming movie is not available on dvd but can be found on vhs
<START> no way i hated <UNK> first she is way too tall of course she is it is tom <UNK> brother who's playing her and i hate that thing she does when she <UNK> her fake silver hair back but there are funny parts in this movie for instance the fact that every single actor looks v g very german and also that they think that even when left alone they should pretend that that guy tom is their actual <UNK> or something i specially liked not that moment where charlotte leaves and starts walking to the nearest gas station to ask for some help she suddenly finds herself in the middle of some woods where were these before nobody <UNK> explaining and turns turns turns a r d like a <UNK> looking at the stars and ignoring the fact that <UNK> behind her ready to strike but anyway the music wasn't so bad the <UNK> were okay and the ending terribly provocative <UNK> wish i had the german version
<START> this movie was difficult for me to watch stan looked very old and ill compared to what i remembered and ollie was <UNK> than i ever recall in another film most difficult though were gaps in the script production where i found myself wondering how did they get from here to there it took nearly half the film before i could deal with the dubbing of non american actors that was also a distraction br br although i miss great actors such as laurel and hardy will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era this film helps me understand why actors sometimes bow out in their prime
<START> i have watched love jones over thirty times it is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be african americans the dialogue was realistically written and delivered with honesty it was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional african americans this is virtually an <UNK> market love jones was visually captivating as well the chemistry between <UNK> <UNK> and long will bring memories of past and present love the feeling of the film is jazz and blues and brings to mine the <UNK> of a warm <UNK> hot chocolate with a <UNK> of <UNK> and if you hadn't guessed i loved it
<START> having had more than a few mates suggest i check rise of the out i eventually got round to it last night undoubtedly the story <UNK> <UNK> has to tell and did so in his autobiography is a compelling tale of one mans <UNK> from <UNK> boot boy to connected underworld villain this film sadly <UNK> in quality by appalling accents and <UNK> acting <UNK> in the lead role of <UNK> does a reasonable job of conveying the transition from <UNK> to serious criminal but his accent is all over the place as his voice provides the stories narration it is something that after ten minutes was driving me nuts terry stone as tony tucker provided the unintentional comedy with an ill fitting wig or the worst <UNK> going dialogue that was so <UNK> <UNK> it <UNK> on juvenile and an over the top in line delivery <UNK> tucker to parody what troubled me most about this film was that the events leading up to the shooting in <UNK> and the <UNK> years of <UNK> are of genuine interest to crime fans and fans of football <UNK> so to have this story <UNK> by a lack of credible accents and acting left me feeling an opportunity had been missed <UNK> and frank <UNK> provide the films only source of authenticity on the positive side some of the films pacing and <UNK> <UNK> well and kept the attention the violence was well choreographed and aside from an over <UNK> on <UNK> red <UNK> for blood was on the whole realistic if you enjoyed the film then it is worth checking out <UNK> boys telling a similar tale from <UNK> viewpoint and also featuring billy murray
<START> silly comedy casts an embarrassed seeming ray <UNK> as a british officer in world war ii europe escaping german confines and taking up with a man hungry gypsy woman played by marlene <UNK> slowly paced overlong and miscast the leads are far too old for this type of juvenile fodder although marlene shines in her solo moments it took three <UNK> to adapt <UNK> book for the screen but this material must have already seemed dated by <UNK> it <UNK> of something <UNK> lubitsch might have turned out in 1939 the scenario is <UNK> and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together from
<START> i found <UNK> to be a lousy attempt to continue the success of the story the original movie was a story about evil and how it can <UNK> our lives br br <UNK> version is lacking in evil viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of dread fear or even foreboding <UNK> version offers evident evil shows <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> and builds a convincing story that is plausible given father background <UNK> story leaves one wondering exactly what happened <UNK> does not evoke the emotions of the viewers to empathize with father and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was troubled in the first place br br anyone interested in seeing a sequel which lives up to the original should see exorcist the beginning
<START> as a child growing up in the sydney of the 1950s i can readily identify with the content of this fine film each week i visited the <UNK> cinema on george street to watch the and usually 3 stooges shorts never has there been a better <UNK> of b w and colour in a film <UNK> production values round off a never to be forgotten movie experience
<START> <UNK> feast and the <UNK> mouth are the two most insightful accurate films on what it is to be a real artist the key lines in <UNK> feast are not as some other <UNK> here have said an artist is never poor but two lines that come before and after it br br i was able to make them happy when i gave of my very best throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist give me the chance to do my very best br br i spent nine years producing experimental multi media music theater in san francisco raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers actors <UNK> etc and the artists i supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best they were just like <UNK> they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work <UNK> art is fine french cooking and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10 000 <UNK> when after years in political <UNK> from france isolated with two caring <UNK> on a bleak <UNK> coast she suddenly gets a of 10 000 <UNK> she does what every real artist would do she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best and so she does it she spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist the twist in the movie is that we don't know she is such an artist until she is actually cooking and serving the meal up until then she appears to be just a working class french lady who a bit with the and is very serious her husband and son were murdered in paris violence in <UNK> br br to such an artist it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it that is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving <UNK> did not cook this meal as a gift to the two <UNK> or to the religious community it was not her goal to achieve a <UNK> or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious <UNK> indeed she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them after the meal she is sitting alone <UNK> some wine not paying the slightest attention to how the guests <UNK> she is <UNK> in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist br br that is why it is so satisfying and so important to the story that the general unexpectedly shows up for as <UNK> knows instantly a general will know what she has placed before him and will appreciate it for there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it she is glad very glad he came in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner the only one she <UNK> out for special treatment not either of the <UNK> but she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it br br to anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first class <UNK> dinner as i have my father was naval <UNK> to paris in the 1980s and i had my honeymoon in france this dinner and <UNK> satisfaction in making it and the pleasure it brings to the <UNK> is absolutely convincing if any art has the power to the <UNK> with a sense of joy it is a fine french meal <UNK> and served in france this movie makes a claim about the <UNK> effects of great art on the <UNK> before the dinner the members of the little religious <UNK> are <UNK> up old <UNK> the old <UNK> fail to <UNK> good <UNK> people ignore them talk over them but the shared experience of sensual great art for the people can enjoy the tastes of the <UNK> and even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art <UNK> the people puts them in a <UNK> mood <UNK> them and by making them happy encourages them to love each other and thus has a god like sacred effect of bringing peace this is the claim found in the modern art movement today that art can <UNK> the traditional <UNK> in making mankind more peaceful thus contrary to those <UNK> here who say that this film speaks for the power of christian belief it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can <UNK> wounds that christian ritual cannot after all my years in the art world i have to say that this claim that art brings peace that religion cannot is overblown and <UNK> but it is a pretty <UNK> and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film br br one last note at <UNK> arrival at the home a particular french general is named as the person who in <UNK> executed <UNK> husband and son and <UNK> a military rule that she had to flee at the end of the film as the general tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in paris many years before before <UNK> at the conclusion of some military <UNK> it turns out that this same was his host at the meal as the general tells the story french general praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman the only woman he would risk his life for of course that woman was <UNK> thus ironically the same french general who said he <UNK> <UNK> above all other women was responsible for driving her away from france forever
<START> i had gone to the movies expecting to see a great film based on all the word of mouth and terrific reviews the minute the opening sequence started i knew i was in trouble the music and credits were trying so hard to evoke emotion i wanted to <UNK> all i got from this film was clichéd characters contrived dialog and an <UNK> script director writer paul has managed to get great reviews with his manipulative self righteous writing but it doesn't fool me some performance were good don cheadle is always good i think <UNK> howard is slightly over rated but he was decent ludicrous was way too on the nose he should stick to <UNK> brendan <UNK> was fine jennifer <UNK> left no impression what so ever i find nothing interesting about her sandra <UNK> is always the same in every movie she's just okay matt dillon was very good and i enjoyed watching him work ryan <UNK> was good as well but as far as the script and the lousy directing this is actually one of those movies that is so annoyingly bad i actually took the time to write about it i would not recommend this film to anyone what a waste of time
<START> you can't watch a film like peter <UNK> <UNK> a story of the exploitation of a pop music performer by big business the state and even organized religion without thinking of <UNK> <UNK> like michael jackson or britney spears who <UNK> corporate giants like <UNK> or some other poison for money or any number of <UNK> in music or movies who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests like <UNK> and <UNK> a film like <UNK> must have seemed almost like science fiction when released in 1967 so fantastic was its premise today we tend to take celebrity <UNK> for granted giving little thought to its more <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> vision has not only become reality we <UNK> accept this reality as normal br br now consider punishment park as <UNK> challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us and why punishment park demands that we <UNK> with what is being taken from us and why br br heaven help america and for that matter the world if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film it is already so close to reality that in viewing it recently i experienced a genuine nauseating feeling of anxiety br br again <UNK> employs a documentary style narrative whereas in <UNK> some rough edges to this technique were apparent in punishment park it has been <UNK> to sharp <UNK> perfection the sense of realism is enhanced by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> believable portrayals by the entire cast this is the kind of acting hollywood has completely turned its back on to its <UNK> in favor of <UNK> perfect image <UNK> the cast has first rate material to work with in <UNK> screenplay br br many cinematic <UNK> have tried to shake the viewer out of their <UNK> false sense of security no one has ever achieved this result with such stark and chilling accuracy as peter does here br br what seems quite clear now is that instead of trying to bring the estranged and <UNK> americans such as these people back into the national community the administration has chosen to accept and exploit the present division within the country and to side with what it considers is the majority instead of the politics of <UNK> it has chosen the politics of <UNK> br br to <UNK> one of the characters we don't have to call them pigs because they know what they are better than we do
<START> it would be a shame if tommy lee jones and robert <UNK> ever see this movie as they will probably be associated with it in years to come oh yeah the public will say <UNK> that's the mini series about the texas rangers and the <UNK> indians that starred tommy lee jones and robert <UNK> it was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in i think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy i really don't understand why they agreed to be in it that would be such an injustice as the original <UNK> <UNK> was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and jones and <UNK> will be remembered for it
<START> pat o'brien portrays the all american <UNK> dame football coach no doubt this film will be considerably more appealing to those interested in some aspect of all american <UNK> dame football probably it's most interesting to serious followers of football and or <UNK> dame football you will see some good documentary style film footage br br otherwise it's difficult to recommend this as a film it's not much more than an historical document you'll know the end is near when <UNK> page gets a chill and don't blink or you'll miss ronald reagan doing of all things <UNK> br br all american 1940 lloyd bacon pat o'brien <UNK> page ronald reagan
<START> once you can get over <UNK> cage playing an italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love not war you can get down to enjoying this beautiful looking film this could be used as an <UNK> for <UNK> in the <UNK> john hurt is great and penelope <UNK> isn't bad as you might expect christian character is somewhat one dimensional which is a shame br br the main <UNK> of this film is the adaptation from the book having been told subsequently the differences between the book and film plots i feel cheated out of a much better and more convincing storyline
<START> i have no words to really describe this series br br the premise behind this concept a highly <UNK> girl with a very eccentric personality which ends up <UNK> up a team of <UNK> into her own rendering of the world which after all was a creation of since she wants a world with aliens and time <UNK> is a breath of fresh air in a world ridden with repetitive anime series and non innovative tv shows br br characters are well developed and you will end up loving them some less than others the word to describe the animation job does not exist since excellent would really fall short to describe how was done there are many funny situations which either will make you smile or put you into deep thoughts don't fall for the impression of the first episode since that's only the tip of the iceberg as the novels are yet to come br br the only problem comes due to the lack of <UNK> order in the episodes but you can solve that problem no br br conclusion <UNK> one of the best series of 2006
<START> the only thing of interest about this movie is its subject matter taking a look at the <UNK> family from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea however trying to make sense of the <UNK> is something that can really only be accomplished in a <UNK> and this ain't it br br presumably because there was so much information to squeeze into a screenplay this film was done in a faux documentary style with <UNK> thrown in trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on br br worse there's an incredibly weak sub plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter day as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the <UNK> of the killings it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time br br all in all this movie is one big wasted opportunity the one ray of sunshine is the acting of marc who plays <UNK> who in real life did most of the actual killing whereas the female characters come off as <UNK> <UNK> in the 60s flashbacks manages to convey real feeling br br in short don't bother with this movie
<START> this could have been a great movie with plenty of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution <UNK> the creative work in science research and <UNK> life but it is not br br the screenplay is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a mexican soup opera melodrama while it is true that <UNK> gradually lost his religious beliefs this was in great part due to his <UNK> during the voyage of the and not solely due to the loss of his daughter he was certainly disturbed by his loss but that did not made him literally insane <UNK> and detached from his friends and family the such portrayal of <UNK> is an invention of the script writer thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about <UNK> life and psyche according to most historians <UNK> had the theory ready by the end of the voyage and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data in the movie it is an imaginary conflict of <UNK> with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughter's death that kept him from going public br br the movie brings a modern situation the vs scientists debate into the life and times of <UNK> thus it is <UNK> it depicts thomas not as a man trying to develop further understanding of <UNK> but as someone eager to kill god in his own words from the movie and destroy the church who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a <UNK> of plenty of <UNK> data is presented as a very arrogant and <UNK> person a combination that i interpret was an attempt to <UNK> active <UNK> who speak up against religion in real life accepted <UNK> ideas after <UNK> only gradually and before the work of <UNK> he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution his first support of evolution was published one month after the origin of species became public he was <UNK> but did not think it was necessary to kill god only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural the debate vs scientists appears throughout the movie and catch phrases such as it is only a theory are part of the discussion of course no such <UNK> or catch phrases existed at that time in fact the <UNK> church published a positive review of the saying that they saw god's work in evolution in some sense quite in fact in <UNK> to the way that the <UNK> is portrayed in the screenplay br br another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a <UNK> crazy man who just writes a lot nothing could be further from the truth the conception of the theory of evolution was the result of <UNK> observations of living forms by <UNK> during five years in the <UNK> and was developed gradually as it can be seen from <UNK> notes of the voyage even though the voyage was the sole most important part of <UNK> life to the conception of origin of species the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations to make it worse <UNK> is shown performing a single experiment <UNK> <UNK> to test his theory and in the end <UNK> it and i'm not really sure whether such experiment did actually occur br br great disappointment it is not in any way a homage to <UNK> and science
<START> no way this overly simplistic script with basically one character should be interpreted as feature entertainment in reality it has about enough material for an <UNK> minute short and even that would seriously tax your attention span zero characters beyond noble <UNK> are developed the never ending closeups of lips and <UNK> are sleep inducing and the script is so underdeveloped that a <UNK> could have written it in fact this whole sad thing shouldn't have even been put on film a tape recording would have been more than sufficient to put you to sleep definitely not recommended <UNK>
<START> this is the <UNK> <UNK> idiotic stupid movies i ever saw in my entire life i can't believe there are directors who make these kinds of movies this movie is a disgrace to horror genre acting oh no i couldn't bear it's full of anguish don't ever watch this movie you'll feel like u are being tortured to eternity please save yourself from the horrible fate of watching this movie if you really want to live don't watch it there are very good horror movies br br this movie doesn't deserve <UNK> single vote too but i hate to vote if i want to post my comments
<START> this was alright it was one of those we <UNK> but we don't have enough evidence yet <UNK> in the couple of movies i've seen her in i've never really though much of stephanie <UNK> a professional tv actress she is but nothing really outstanding here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed or was it fed on <UNK> <UNK> her character got along well with the <UNK> bunch of special investigation unit cops she was assigned with there wasn't really a goofy character you'd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is but when i found out i wasn't that surprised oh well one more thing that was good was the los angeles locations quite possibly if this was made today they'd use toronto or <UNK> but here they really shot in downtown l a like that a lot even though i semi despise l a liked the movie too i don't know if i'd ever watch it again but it wasn't too bad my grade b
<START> frankly after <UNK> club and <UNK> it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and <UNK> it was well shot but then again it is a big budget movie it was too predictable even for a chick flick i even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end the only thing i didn't know was how too politically correct very disappointing the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful but if you want that watch national <UNK> i love lane but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy as far as gere goes he's a good actor but he had movies like this so i'm not surprised an hour and a half i wish i could bring back
<START> why spend a moment <UNK> through this awkward and self conscious movie every now and then after an hour of tedious plot and amateur acting we start getting bits and pieces of the big band swing that made tommy and jimmy <UNK> <UNK> and together the great musicians they were occasionally in a jam session with art <UNK> with tommy <UNK> and his orchestra doing marie and a standout jimmy <UNK> and his orchestra bob and helen <UNK> singing green eyes we get a complete song br br unfortunately the movie is in the public <UNK> and the dvd transfer is just as bad as the acting my copy has only four chapter stops that means you can get <UNK> in your fast forward finger trying to speed through to where the good stuff is the swamp you're moving through is hollywood's version of the life and battles of the two tommy superb on <UNK> and jimmy superb on <UNK> usually couldn't stand each other in <UNK> they finally split with tommy starting his own orchestra each had greater success alone than they had achieved together they <UNK> when their father died in the forties which is where the movie ends they later managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by tommy as the big band era faded out in the fifties tommy died in 1956 at age <UNK> <UNK> in his sleep after booze <UNK> and a big meal jimmy died of cancer at <UNK> in 1957 jimmy was hugely talented and from all accounts a reasonably easy going guy tommy was hugely talented and from all accounts often an overbearing jerk but good music makes up for a lot of faults and the big band sounds the two created helped define the swing era br br they play themselves in the movie and we see them develop from <UNK> with child actors to grown men battling and <UNK> at each other the movie is <UNK> with not just their two parents played by those hollywood irish clichés sara and arthur <UNK> who just want their boys to get along with each other but also with a major sub story involving a romance between janet blair as a childhood friend of the who becomes a <UNK> with them and serves as a nearly full time <UNK> and <UNK> and william as a piano player blair is not bad at all however if you want to see why she never became the star she quite probably should have become just look at the films like this one that her studio put her in no wonder she left hollywood simply takes up space br br how bad is this movie other than when we can actually hear the play well here's a song written especially for the movie and given to blair to <UNK> it's called to me br br to me you're the rose of a <UNK> the rise of a rising sea the glow of a star br br the rose of a <UNK> the movie doesn't get any better than this and it can't get worse still if you like the and if the price is right well in <UNK> i'd still not buy it the highlight for me is and <UNK> singing green eyes you can watch them on you tube for free you'll also find there quite a bit of each of the i wish i'd known
<START> i've rent the movie because i'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i've read better than save private ryan <UNK> i thought cool guys is just a ridiculous movie almost fun nothing to do with a proper war movie i want my money back why the f k the peoples lies f no subtitles they tried to make everything <UNK> with the light but they didn't make it sorry about this but the movie is awful the italians are shown as mafia e br br the american as stupid farmer the germans as even more stupid farmer br br the actor are ridiculous and <UNK> br br please please
<START> this very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable which is ironic given the film's theme no one coming into this film knows what they are in for worse than that 3 4 of the way into the film no one still has any clue of what they're in for because everything up to that moment is a different movie br br as a front row fan of first two films easily competing for the best 2 mormon films to date competing with saints and soldiers and now new york doll saw that at a screening had me wanting to see his film for a very long time i was there i wanted to believe believe that i'd see the next great mormon movie one that would hold the <UNK> <UNK> spot for a very long time but no three <UNK> in the film took the <UNK> of left turns and dragged me through something that i never wanted to go through he takes on the <UNK> <UNK> of all moral issues <UNK> both of them with little time or emotional capacity left to adequately address them but instead waves them both off with a nod towards jesus as if that will make all things well instantly true it is that jesus saves don't <UNK> me of not believing that that's not problem br br is the film shot well indeed do the actors act they acted their pants off was the music appropriate all but whatever was over the closing credits everything about this film was superb except the story which was so <UNK> and wrong that all else doesn't matter i learned <UNK> from new york doll very decent show by the way the third act of the film was neither <UNK> nor pleasant nor faith <UNK> i know was <UNK> over backwards to make it so but i was so far shoved out of the movie at that point that nothing no thing could have brought me back the preposterous <UNK> of dozens of details in the final minutes didn't help anyone who's been on a mission knows what i'm talking about especially anyone familiar with events surrounding someone being sent home from a mission early for moral and or psychological reasons it's as if a parallel universe suddenly <UNK> up where normal rules or <UNK> suddenly don't apply br br there are a million things good about this film but they were created and only to be <UNK> upon and thrown away in a <UNK> jerk fit of <UNK> this will really get them <UNK> hence unforgivable i can only hope that when puts the finishing touches on his next film falling apparently that he remembers that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that it's the fans that pay the bills that's why the first god's army was such an <UNK> success br br shock and awe approach proves that when it comes to the big issues he is in way over his head having neither the spiritual nor creative maturity nor business sense necessary to take them on i <UNK> learns his lesson and that years from now he and we all look back with a <UNK> and <UNK> that he pulled his head out of where the light doesn't shine and really successfully takes on those and other issues and changes the world forever because of it
<START> i loved this movie when it first came out but i was just 12 years old then and i had forgotten this film existed until one day i found a used copy for sale at a gas station i bought it and i couldn't wait to watch this film that had i loved as a kid and then as i saw this film again many years later it hit me why in the world did i like this film as a kid watching it again as an adult i realized that this film is terrible the saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it the costumes are perfect good actors there are 2 music scores the score is wonderful and keeps with the classic spirit of the old <UNK> lone ranger alive the second score is a series of songs by country music like <UNK> and the <UNK> brothers and those songs like the man in the mask are so bad that they are funny this movies strongest point is that it had a <UNK> storyline and one of the best western plots ever and for a while its fun to watch as john reid is <UNK> back to health after he and his fellow rangers are <UNK> its fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the lone ranger as he his identity and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he <UNK> with but <UNK> as good as the storyline is its all ruined by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> everything as you are watching it happen for the love of god why did they do that between <UNK> narration and the <UNK> brothers singing corny stupid songs like ride little cowboy being playing in the make this movie impossible to take serious i would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re do this film right because at the heart of this silly film is a great western i would this film as a beautiful woman dress in the <UNK> clothing i give it 4 stars out of 10 if your 12 years old and dont know better then you might love it
<START> warning some spoilers ahead br br what an incredibly crappy movie it makes iron eagle 2 seem good br br the story is as follows captain holiday <UNK> <UNK> gets shot down by his friend <UNK> robert patrick to stop him from shooting down a <UNK> <UNK> filled with innocent civilians six years later holiday returns to take his revenge among other things he sitting in a tank chases <UNK> now a colonel and his pregnant wife over a field he manages to fire <UNK> and drive the tank at the same time after getting the tank blown up by a <UNK> he miraculously survives and steals a fighter jet with it he shoots down a number of allied fighters before attacking the <UNK> <UNK> in an attempt to kill <UNK> wife br br an extra bonus is that major <UNK> who holiday hangs in her office has put the rank <UNK> on her right shoulder on backwards elegant
<START> <UNK> iv may not be the best out of the series but it isn't too bad if you don't take it fully serious then you may enjoy it br br it's nice to see peter return as <UNK> graves who has gave up using magic and has became a detective but still thinks about what happened in <UNK> br br the plot is about a woman named alexandra that is ex girlfriend that breaks into a museum and takes a red gem using the gem she <UNK> her boyfriend named <UNK> that is dark side but he needs the gem so he can enter the real world and john is sent to hell br br something goes wrong and alex loses the gem so she needs to find a new one as she leaves the <UNK> is still open and two little <UNK> named <UNK> and appear they're not the true <UNK> since they look like guys in a <UNK> costume wearing a mask but that doesn't matter since they are humorous in parts br br <UNK> and dark need to find <UNK> since he can return them home so they go around causing mayhem as they try to find <UNK> another difference is that the two <UNK> are the good guys unlike the ones in the previous films br br i found <UNK> iv to be good but this film may not go for everyone check it out if you like low budget films like <UNK> 2
<START> i truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind it br br sure i'm all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture <UNK> <UNK> edge is an excellent example of a well made teen drama however what i take exception to is the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> approach that the makers of 2 <UNK> took br br a prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them br br my other major problem with this film apart from its complete <UNK> of gus van <UNK> elephant surprised van <UNK> didn't sue is its loose in a china <UNK> attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide br br in short avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently i've heard that his motivation for making 2 <UNK> may or may not be based on lies having seen the <UNK> result this doesn't surprise me in the slightest this is a <UNK> student film exercise that has no place whatsoever being in a cinema or on dvd pure and simple
<START> maybe people do like having the devil around more than god maybe we like that safety net of a reason making a mistake only to blame the devil for the pain and suffering in the world there is so much <UNK> <UNK> out into the masses that it is difficult to not see the sadness on the faces of all you pass <UNK> p fitzgerald understands all of this he knows that maybe everything won't be ok and maybe helping someone leave this earth to avoid the pain their life has waiting for them is a risk he needs to take for someone he loves credit goes to screenwriter director matthew ryan for creating a lyrical <UNK> about two suburban families who have crossed paths in good times and bad just looking at the cast of almost all a and b list actors shows that the material really <UNK> with its audience emotions don't need to be worn on one's <UNK> to exist sometimes all we want to do is end the suffering br br ryan <UNK> brings an understated performance to the table here that <UNK> the of his character emotions he is a very passionate and intelligent young man cutting through the <UNK> of life knowing what he sees and accepting the worse with the better the film is a <UNK> for the souls of those affected by the horrific event of <UNK> killing his ex <UNK> mentally challenged brother in the confused mind of this teen he goes into the incident knowing full well what he was going to do he was going to stop the pain that he sees everywhere but most of all on the face of young ryan <UNK> almost immediately he realizes that he has made a mistake that maybe playing god is not a job he has been put on earth to do whether or not this is true will soon be put to debate as the murder begins a chain of events which finally bring meaning to many people's lives as they wake up to the <UNK> <UNK> of life this boy has opened their eyes to both sorrow and <UNK> br br with haunting <UNK> sung by former sunny day real estate <UNK> jeremy the movie goes through a journey of small vignettes of two <UNK> lives in the aftermath of tragedy the acting is superb throughout with special mention to a few for someone who plays the <UNK> <UNK> in most films chris <UNK> actually does well with much the same material here yet also with an evolution into a man of purpose his <UNK> is effective when <UNK> in the right part similar to his success in election and i am interested to see if directors will be allow him to expand his talents and sink his teeth into something more substantial <UNK> malone is effective in much the same effect as well playing the role of troubled youth as she has in <UNK> <UNK> and life as a house don cheadle is a <UNK> of <UNK> giving us a different take on the compassionate <UNK> from the one he did in manic and martin <UNK> is brilliant as the <UNK> father trying to keep his wits together and eventually realizing he must keep his family from falling apart as well also it is great seeing the beautiful <UNK> in a small but important role br br when tragedy hits people band together to get through it all as <UNK> <UNK> points out at one point you see men and women helping others out and <UNK> when they see the pain and suffering surrounding them but after a couple of days everything goes back to normal <UNK> character <UNK> the optimistic viewpoint that at least we get a glimpse of people's true nature of wanting to help and be good to each other only to be shot back at with the <UNK> well at least we do during tragedy maybe we don't want to think we are good natured because it does make us feel we should be good all the time and that when bad must have in turn meant to be so by being flawed we allow ourselves to <UNK> and try again mistake lets him see the love he had for those close to him as well as opening the eyes of others to wake up and not let their loved ones drift any further from them one can't focus on the sadness of others when they must first come to grips with their own has crafted a <UNK> for this and a truly effective piece of film making with hopefully many more to come
<START> i saw this on the sci fi channel so i knew it would be bad to start with but i was surprised at how much worse it was than expected the cg effects on the dragon were terrible even for the sci fi channel and the writing was pathetic i couldn't tell if this was supposed to be that stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it's so terrible it's almost funny especially the part where patrick <UNK> knight character goes home to his knight father who has retired after losing his legs and is now bed ridden in his armor for the sole purpose of letting the audience know he was a knight the majority of the movie focuses around an enormous dragon egg that <UNK> into a not so enormous baby dragon with some of the worst cgi i've ever seen this was just awful
<START> mostly <UNK> biblical <UNK> <UNK> that drags on for well over two hours the only thing that saves this film from god's <UNK> and there is only one god remember is the unintentionally funny dialog and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie for most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be <UNK> by mst3k br br george sanders is absolutely awful one of the most animated overly theatrical performances i've ever seen <UNK> isn't much better his stiff wooden acting combined with the horrendous fortune cookie wisdom <UNK> make for a rather boring and silly <UNK> it seems that every time <UNK> opens his mouth something oh so wise and ridiculously high and mighty comes out to an extent it's not <UNK> and fault because of the crappy comical dialog and the typically biblical one dimensional characterization but they made little effort otherwise accent even reminds a bit of <UNK> this is not a plus only <UNK> manages to avoid embarrassing herself by playing the role with more conviction and in an appropriate way which <UNK> a role in such a silly film to describe these biblical characters as one dimensional would be too give them <UNK> credit the characterization is half dimensional
<START> the brilliance of this story delivers at least one <UNK> crafted message to each viewer in the audience this story is about success it's about failure it's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you the story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large no camera angle could cover it within the grasp of each scene is <UNK> an element marked for depiction within your imagination keep this in mind as you watch the movie it's more than eye candy the sexually suggestive rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development
<START> a bad bad movie terrible plot <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> but he speaks maybe 20 words in the entire movie and only has one fight scene still in great shape considering he was also in the kung fu classic enter the dragon interesting to see william johnny from the karate kid in another martial arts role
<START> if i had never seen an episode of the original <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> or i would have appreciated this series more while the cast did its best to sustain the action and interest of the scripts i was just caught up in comparing the episodes to the original series there was an expectation of <UNK> <UNK> more in fight scenes and the continuity seemed as though the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors to be honest i can't blame them for trying to <UNK> the fans from the original series but it just didn't work as <UNK> by the fact that it lasted one season watching <UNK> labor through this series reminded me of gen macarthur when he said <UNK> soldiers never die they just fade away '
<START> this 1950's <UNK> is so bad it's unintentionally funny tom <UNK> portrays dr gerard a scientist who is turning natives into a monster using voodoo his poor wife played by mary ellen kay is being held captive by her <UNK> <UNK> who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him along comes <UNK> english as a greedy <UNK> who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle her idiot boyfriend portrayed by lance fuller is along on the <UNK> they hire touch <UNK> later <UNK> mike <UNK> of <UNK> fame as a guide english is a terrible actress but hey no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either touch i'm sorry i can't even type the name without cracking up i mean what the gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that's saying a lot the monster is only seen briefly and the ending is predictable to say the least i would say this movie falls into the it's so bad it's almost good category of movies it's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube
<START> i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> this was before generation x br br in a way most of us are products of the same <UNK> culture these high school kids spend their time drinking getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a <UNK> br br what would they do today would things be different some very important questions there are some excellent scenes with keanu reeves and the dysfunctional family he lives with his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted the mother has no idea what to do spends her time drinking with her boyfriend br br this film was a bit before its time in that it <UNK> the problems in lower class american society these kids had no <UNK> what is available for them in this dirt water town all in all a few interesting social <UNK> are presented and there are no <UNK> 9 10
<START> a brilliant horror film utterly gruesome and very scary too the thing is a remake from john carpenter but please do not let that put you off this film it is simply brilliant the start of the film has the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that <UNK> the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'the <UNK> one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever br br the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in is visually impressive on dvd widescreen it must have been great in the cinema i regret not seeing this on the big screen br br kurt russell is excellent as <UNK> the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has <UNK> their base all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when <UNK> <UNK> everyone thats still alive for <UNK> it is tense scary and finally spectacular i love it because its funny as well br br special mention must go to rob <UNK> for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself if he didn't get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have this is also <UNK> as to whether this is john carpenter's greatest film its certainly a gruesome masterpiece br br wait for a cold winter night get some <UNK> from the <UNK> sit down and watch the thing a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and <UNK> br br utterly brilliant br br ten out of ten
<START> i was looking through tv guide last night and saw a movie starring heather <UNK> on who i liked in movies like boogie nights and austin powers so i decided to watch it it started out ok but you could tell the story was lacking and at about half way through it started to <UNK> i do not remember this movie being in the theaters and i'm sure if it was it wasn't there long the acting was stale and unconvincing the dialogue was silly and predictable and the story was confusing and stupid <UNK> one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i like movies like the ones this has been compared to like fight club but this one doesn't come close heather <UNK> has done much better things since i gave it a 2 out of 10 but thats because i <UNK> on the wrong number i meant to give it a 1
<START> sickening exploitation trash plays like a bad and reverse death wish ripoff but the ugly and <UNK> makes charles bronson look like al pacino with her performance as for <UNK> stylish direction when a film is so vile dumb and deeply offensive it's hard for the viewer to pay attention to such details
<START> in this movie virtual sexuality the 17 year old <UNK> is not lucky in love one day when she is stood up she goes with her friend to a reality <UNK> there she is introduced with a machine that can change your look <UNK> and whatever you like in virtual reality she decides to try it out but begins to make a boyfriend of her own her then suddenly there is an explosion in a gas <UNK> and her creation comes to life i'll say no more you'll have to watch the movie which is quite fun to watch
<START> alright let me break it down for ya <UNK> is probably one of the funniest pointless movies you'll ever see it's got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie basically if you've seen jackass or the series you'd know what to expect for humor considering it has most of the people from those movies overall i just had to give it a 10 10 because its one of my favorite movies of all time br br br br p s <UNK> rules
<START> robin williams shows his stand up talents and <UNK> up his status as a comedian in this movie of what's wrong in american politics and how can hollywood try to make an influence without boring people of course hollywood uses movies with hidden or not so hidden <UNK> i think this movie is for people who likes stand up and political discussion and the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this everybody knows hollywood is more liberal <UNK> than the bush co so they have to make these movies every now and then but this one was perhaps too obvious at least i thought so for making any real change br br still great stand up and fresh political issues and talks i enjoyed it and thanks to imdb com ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater and yes i laughed many times sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness see this movie if you like good and clever stand up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now rent it if that doesn't match you
<START> i adore hedy <UNK> i think she was vastly underrated as an actress during the 40s she was the <UNK> kinski of that era and critics didn't take her seriously having said all that this film is a bore when i watched it for the first time i was shocked at the lack of continuity not only in story but in makeup and costumes <UNK> makeup changes from shot to shot so does hair length and style reason this thing had so many writers and <UNK> so many stops and starts it's amazing they ever released it at all her lady of the <UNK> began filming after this one began yet it was released before i take this woman in fact at the time it was known in hollywood as i re take this woman that should tell you something i'm a spencer tracy fan as well but he is awful here i've read in various film <UNK> that he absolutely <UNK> hedy <UNK> and that looks perfectly obvious on film no whatsoever the story wanders around for reel after reel and finally just rolls to an end very strangely i can't recommend this one at all
<START> maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after conan o'brien and late <UNK> fans are all of a sudden <UNK> watching <UNK> show carson <UNK> can't hold a candle to leno <UNK> o'brien or any other late night talk show host and last call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre the shows only redeeming quality is that it's so short but i wouldn't call it crap carson <UNK> is sincere and doesn't hide the fact that his show isn't great that honesty is actually helpful here while some of last <UNK> skits and material seem to be stolen they still find the mark sometimes actually some of <UNK> montages have been quite entertaining and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy br br as an <UNK> carson is okay even with only one guest not exactly late night material but still above the level <UNK> by a high school <UNK> team however he doesn't have the quick wit that makes conan so hilarious i do not like his musical guests but that's more because i am not a fan of that kind of music so i'm not holding it against him br br on to the house band i don't know joe band and wouldn't compare them to the cbs orchestra the show band with kevin <UNK> or the max <UNK> 7 even and the are better but band mates do still the show in my opinion especially the <UNK> <UNK> player that sometimes shows up he has long dark hair and <UNK> and is always playing in the upper register if anything watch the show for him i do br br in summary this show isn't even worth a full bag of <UNK> bits but it does have an audience and appeals more to the younger mtv generation if you don't have cable and are up at 1 <UNK> am there really isn't much more to choose from and surprise surprise there is worse out there in that time frame so if you're waiting for poker after dark to come on 30 minutes of last call wont kill you during the wait
<START> went out with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in london we didn't know what to expect the poster gave some of it away and i won't say any more so as not to spoil the plot but we found it to be an excellent film with great acting convincing plot and scary as hell having done some research on the making of the film i have to hand it to those guys the filmmakers actors writers etc for having put together such a film with such limited resources post production very well done too for all of that i give them a 10 out of 10 and i hope they will continue their fine work keep it up guys you rock
<START> <UNK> will <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gut br br first of all i didn't know how diverse the sound of <UNK> <UNK> i live in turkey faith akin and alexander have made a different approach for turkish music <UNK> performing seeing <UNK> and <UNK> music from a <UNK> aspect had given the real meaning of the music itself br br in this movie i had found out how different our turkish culture is how interesting our performers are and how much respect they deserve unfortunately no one have been able to serve this kind of documentary before
<START> saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids a bit predictable the book was better gave more plot details <UNK> about the environment and how the kids <UNK> the conspiracy i think <UNK> humor comes across better in the book than the movie but there were lots of funny moments in the movie as well it is probably a bit too slow paced for kids under 6 <UNK> of age loved the casting of jimmy <UNK> as the science teacher and those baby <UNK> were adorable i wonder how they managed to film them the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing am i imagining it or did the author carl make a brief appearance
<START> donald <UNK> and peter cushing united in one horror film that always sounds like a terrific plan two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation who previously already starred together in terrific genre <UNK> like the flesh and the <UNK> and from beyond the grave pairing up in a mid 70's satanic themed exploitation flick how can this possibly go wrong well unfortunately it can to my deepest regret land of the <UNK> can hardly even be called mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic setting the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise in a remote little area in <UNK> more particularly near an <UNK> site multiple tourists <UNK> because baron peter cushing and his <UNK> followers keep feeding them to a fire breathing <UNK> statue cushing who never looked more bored and <UNK> in any role he played before owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the <UNK> <UNK> ruins and an underground network of <UNK> that is of course quite handy if your <UNK> is the kidnapping of random <UNK> and amateur <UNK> when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area father the priest of a couple of towns before decides to investigate land of the <UNK> is a boring and extremely slow paced horror effort that never really <UNK> any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn't bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and <UNK> trivia details the titular <UNK> for example is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person but for some inexplicable reason the script never <UNK> out the significance instead the film focuses on tedious and overly <UNK> sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of donald <UNK> his portrayal of rude <UNK> and old fashioned priest who <UNK> everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always
<START> what a gas of a movie film noir has always been one of my favorite genres but this one stands apart from the rest only the big sleep out of the past murder my sweet and the killers can come close to this caper classic i know these four american films i mentioned are not caper movies per se but rather detective stories with complicated story lines which still <UNK> a gritty quality about them similar to <UNK> br br what is different here is the way jules <UNK> sets into motion the total ambiance of the film not only in the gritty realism of the principals but also in the usage of the streets of paris as a <UNK> character and co <UNK> <UNK> itself the movie centers around le a dark moody and complicated ex con getting pulled into one last shot at the <UNK> payoff even though he is an <UNK> and hard <UNK> tough guy one still senses in him a yearning for some kind of redemption by himself from the demons of his past hey he saved little toni <UNK> picked the right guy jean for that role br br that aside the rest of the story development kind of falls into place as we journey through the famous silent caper scene to the the eventual demise of the principal <UNK> only their women survive except for <UNK> <UNK> honey they seemed to best understand the underlying <UNK> of it all
<START> i went to see with high expectations which might have influence on my opinion on it i have seen all of the <UNK> films and this is by far the worst the story <UNK> with themes from shakespeare's play king <UNK> but never succeeds in capturing the audience and making them care the directing of the actors is very loose even for <UNK> style movies and results in poor <UNK> acting the story lacks any dynamics whatsoever and i lost interest very shortly there are some scenes in the film which are there to shock the viewer but i don't think they enhanced the story at all sang and are both that proved to be well directed and had good <UNK> so i shall look forward to better in the future perhaps an invisible man <UNK> 6 will prove to lift the quality again for he is like and s k a skilled and educated director
<START> therefore it is important to talk about the dvd release instead of just the film tales from the <UNK> is a film that only one studio in the world could deliver the one that has brought us innovative and original real independent films for 30 plus years now troma this is truly a very special film because it manages to be certainly not my favorite of the troma productions but released on a disc that because of what i just said is one of my most <UNK> and favorite dvd's not only counting the countless troma <UNK> i own but counting my entire collection of films the film itself is the result of an ill <UNK> plan to produce a television series to be directed by a director who was trusted with a substantial amount of money especially for troma to make something wonderful and delivered a lot of unfinished and incomprehensible material before <UNK> or being fired i am not sure which at this moment in order to prevent having to <UNK> a vast investment down the toilet lloyd kaufman and michael <UNK> decided to get together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the <UNK> of one movie one movie that really consists of two in the nice old tales from the crypt anthology fashion <UNK> by the played by mr kaufman himself but as i said not quite my own favorite of all their movies that is greatly due to a weird sense of discipline at the various sets forgetting about the hard troma rule of no booze on the set which was discovered by a furious lloyd and other less respectable employees that troma had at the time of the filming of the added scenes all this made it all but impossible for mr kaufman to make a worthwhile product in the editing room but lloyd kaufman is a genius and with the troubled added scenes to an already <UNK> start product he crafted not much less of a masterpiece the film itself is as good as circumstances would allow the most brilliant filmmaker to slice together and it is certainly highly entertaining totally confusing loaded with those elements that made troma great and certainly unique and one of a kind as a film itself though not as brilliant as many other troma productions the genius of independent cinema however made the dvd of this film so much more than a release of a film with some <UNK> the film is when push comes to <UNK> actually only a part of the entire dvd that in its whole is a document of the difficult situation serious filmmakers find themselves in having to survive in a world that is <UNK> by the few very big ones who don't really allow any other players on their market <UNK> a document of the problems one has when <UNK> people to be on the level only to find out that freedom sometimes is something that is hard to live up to and realization that access to a movie budget when the boss is not around can corrupt even those who should really know better the brilliance of this dvd is that the film is not perfect and that lloyd knows it and doesn't want to make anyone think he believes it is the full length commentary is a show in itself as is often the case with mr audio <UNK> mixing humor <UNK> at those who deserve it and highly interesting information for anyone interested in independent film making in such a fashion that watching the film again with this commentary straight after viewing it on its own merits is so interesting it is hard to stop the feature length documentary the thick brown line takes us behind the scenes at the various locations where lloyd visits the sets only to sometimes take over and make the most of what he finds there we see him somewhat <UNK> sometimes different from his appearances in other making of documents such as fart of darkness and apocalypse soon both to be found in the must own make your own damn movie box set br br the added scenes with james <UNK> who started his career at troma only to find success as a writer an now a director in hollywood and <UNK> parker again someone to start out with a troma released work to later be a national hero with his south park series are entertaining and probably as is much else on this release a reason for <UNK> this disc alone for anyone remotely interested in the work of these two characters loaded with much more than i could mention here including a second audio commentary this is one of the best troma dvd releases
<START> i was a <UNK> when i watched this film for the first time the next day i knew that all <UNK> of our form watched it and all were fascinated by the film as i was i think the same situation was in all forms of our school and in the whole soviet union later i watched it every time it was shown on tv and want to watch more i think that comparison with back to the future or other sci fi films is not appropriate is unique in many ways once you have watched it you never forget it br br this film is full of belief in peaceful science achievements full of belief in the beautiful future of our world it's not only the film but also a <UNK> of many scientific <UNK> and achievements the time shown in the film is the year 1984 the year of its creation and the year where a <UNK> <UNK> has traveled for some time and where his friend was from the year now is 2005 many <UNK> and achievements predicted in the film are not realized yet such as a device which can read thoughts of any animal and human to <UNK> and mars as easy as going for a <UNK> in the weekend creating and <UNK> of the <UNK> as a <UNK> for <UNK> easy to drive flying machines which completely replaced <UNK> historical <UNK> of any kind of material or creature performed in a couple of minutes and many others meanwhile some of them nowadays became much more realistic than they seemed in 1984 just wait for br br the film also depicts typical russian <UNK> and <UNK> and does it so naturally with their <UNK> curiosity humour look for example at you could find such character in nearly all forms of every school of the soviet union similar character was in my form too i myself as well as many my classmates fell in love at first sight with her by the way later an actress who played became a scientist i think she was as much influenced by the film as people who watched it on tv br br beautiful idea beautiful realization beautiful actors beautiful music beautiful song the wonderful far away beautiful beautiful beautiful br br the last thing i want to say is that different remakes and new versions of the song from the film and even the film itself were made later and spread on tv and in the internet all they are not even comparable with the original i should not even comment them my comment is only about the original so request the original and enjoy it
<START> i have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung the acting was over the top the direction was tacky and amateurish the script was just a joke the story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game much less a professional game and why why did oliver stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor he was terrible playing the most unrealistic <UNK> ever he could not even get hired to do professional wrestling <UNK> then you have jamie foxx who throws like a girl but he is a tad more athletic than the aged dennis quaid seriously stone wanted to direct this film at 16 year old males with add that is why we hear the loud music the quick cuts and numerous edits it just became a bad mtv video shame on al pacino for doing this crap cameron diaz heck that no talent takes any role that comes down the <UNK> when lawrence taylor is the best actor you got going well your movie sucks and this one does
<START> the movie is a <UNK> to what really happened in city i'm a <UNK> of the people who really lived the story the truth never has come out to my knowledge i have tried to find the whole story out but the people who lived it are still scared to tell it city is still run by crooked people albert <UNK> was not quite the saint the story wants you to believe the story was filmed in city it still has some of the famous sites in it that you see in the movie the funeral home still looks exactly the same but if you are wanting the real history of sin city you have to visit us and find people willing to tell you about ma and her kindness she didn't get the name ma for nothing
<START> the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they'll convince you it's possible alas with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap <UNK> <UNK> films with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience not here though the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day oh and the less said about the ending the better happy film viewing everyone
<START> i actually caught an ad for japan sinks in a japanese magazine last year and wondered what the heck it was until i saw the trailer for the film it was then i remembered that i had seen the english translation of novel some years back i got it and it was quite good as well as <UNK> realistic it's enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about <UNK> in japan br br now i've read the book and seen this 2006 movie version the first movie came out in 1973 and you know what i thought the movie was quite good even if there are major changes from novel to film but that's understandable the story is simple a major shift will cause japan to sink within a year massive <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and rock the country as frantic efforts are made to <UNK> as many people as possible one scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what's left of the <UNK> but can it be <UNK> in time i saw japan sinks at <UNK> 2007 and while there were a couple of problems i had with it it does run a bit too long and a couple of the character moments were a little too sappy i was nonetheless blown away the sheer concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea was made <UNK> real and the effects were some of the best i've ever seen <UNK> anything that hollywood has done the film also plays no favorites with the main characters with some not making it to the closing credits br br frankly i've been surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film difference of opinions i guess personally i enjoyed it and i've read the original book
<START> <UNK> if you are looking for special effects that are 10 20 years before its time this is it the glowing lightning <UNK> <UNK> etc look like they came from a cheesy 70's sci fi flick and yes <UNK> really grows he's not being pushed on a <UNK> closer to the camera
<START> otto <UNK> and <UNK> stands to date as a great american musical i believe it is time bring this film out onto vhs and dvd for countless generations to view admire and <UNK> its wonderful music
<START> carole lombard and james stewart <UNK> try to <UNK> some life and meaning into this <UNK> constructed film about the <UNK> of a <UNK> couple the scenes play as if they were <UNK> out among various directors each with a different goal some are <UNK> cute some screwball some melodramatic and some surprisingly noir there's even an extended adventure sequence when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a <UNK> it's hard to say which scenes are the most <UNK> when the film as a whole is so <UNK> in tone and the storyline not exactly believable only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors some smaller parts such as judge <UNK> and the <UNK> pilot are also very well played
<START> somehow this film <UNK> it's way into the soft spot of my heart don't ask me how it happened but i suppose having the film feature ed i'll <UNK> anything <UNK> as a tail chasing crack hustler had a bit to do with it br br frankly i was disappointed with first outing in 1972 nothing more than a quick throw together to follow <UNK> <UNK> how does the sequel get away from this big jim brown seems stronger as slaughter here than in the first perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work from instead of his simple be like <UNK> motivation before br br the most outstanding part about the film is the soundtrack provided by <UNK> daddy number one james brown almost every scene is <UNK> with a touch of <UNK> by the godfather an excellent period film for the music wardrobe vehicles <UNK> and hair i should also point out this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in motion picture history when jim brown and ed <UNK> could actually grow hair br br double the chicks double the blow triple the body count and factor in ed <UNK> and james brown you'll be in for one hell of a 70s action flick and one that <UNK> it's predecessor no less for my money big rip off can play ball with any <UNK> film ever made even <UNK> chances are you'll disagree but big rip off has it's own distinct feel something the original was lacking
<START> another masterpiece that needs a dvd release but some <UNK> have the vhs and well worth seeking out just a brilliant play about many things foremost being <UNK> <UNK> religion and fundamental human relationships the script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with an issue like a severely disabled child but to <UNK> the parents in their love for jo and each other as the couple alan bates and janet are perfectly matched both in acting <UNK> and in bringing their deep intelligent characters to life br br i've recently seen <UNK> brilliant performance in which was released as a film a couple years after joe egg and he plays a teacher in both cynical intellectual and funny although is much darker than his character of here if you throw in such great performances in the go between women in love <UNK> down the wind the caretaker and <UNK> girl not to mention the more obvious king of hearts and <UNK> the greek and i'd say that alan bates had a career comparable to peter o'toole albert finney and the other great british actors of his era br br director peter <UNK> also had one of my all time favorites the <UNK> class released the same year 1972 as joe egg which <UNK> a career year in <UNK> book he's had kind of a <UNK> filmography the was another highlight but these two gems will mark him as a great director
<START> i was never all that impressed by night gallery but this one episode stands out br br a tv network executive <UNK> an odd act a young nerdy boy who proceeds to make the <UNK> <UNK> the whole thing as a <UNK> waste of time until both <UNK> come true the next morning br br what first seemed a <UNK> act becomes a hit show as the kid's <UNK> prove consistently accurate br br then one day he refuses to do the show facing <UNK> showtime everyone's at <UNK> end even threatening him with legal action if he doesn't fulfill his contract and make his daily <UNK> br br the young boy <UNK> and <UNK> a seemingly <UNK> tomorrow br br after the show the <UNK> executive asks for an explanation only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal
<START> after 15 minutes watching the movie i was asking myself what to do leave the theater sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth i finally watched the movie what a waste of time maybe i am not a 5 years old kid anymore
<START> this two character drama is extremely well acted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments shocking not because they are graphic but because you're not prepared for them when they come but eventually it does become oppressive just like the somewhat similar a pure <UNK> did still alan <UNK> should have gotten an oscar nomination for his multi dimensional performance no doubt about it 1 2
<START> this film was bad was it meant to be a comedy as i couldn't help laughing the whole way through it what a waste of two hours donald sutherland was wooden not that he was alone everyone else was just as bad and how miscast was linda hamilton
<START> i'm a fan of zhang <UNK> and finally found this dvd title from the shelves of a <UNK> after a long search at many places br br this is a huge departure from previous zhang <UNK> work <UNK> in terms of style and locale the director himself has said that this is the first and only time he'll ever attempt to make a black comedy set in contemporary china you may even say this work is experimental in nature compared to his other well known big budget and <UNK> pieces br br filmed with a hand held camera and wide angle lens throughout the duration of the whole film the quick pace editing and high energy performance <UNK> tone never let you go once it grips you from the start it presents a very realistic account of modern chinese urban sensibilities which in this case is set in <UNK> if you appreciate and love this kind of black humor you will love this film totally also look out for hilarious cameos by <UNK> happy times and the director zhang <UNK> himself br br a last point of note i find the characters in this film as in all other zhang <UNK> films <UNK> similar personality traits <UNK> always trying to beat the odds up the <UNK> do let me know your thoughts on this br br david lee
<START> i had this movie given to me and have to admit i am glad that i did not pay money for it br br the back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle with 2 women trying to seduce her but the reality in this movie is far from that br br in reality the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all br br even movies like silence of the <UNK> and wild things which the box tries to compare this movie to were riveting because of the unexpected turns and suspense br br but jaded has none of this it concentrates on the and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them and the of a <UNK> that may prove the victims story is true br br while it does show that same sex rape is possible it is not a movie worth watching br br if at all possible pass this movie up at all costs
<START> since others have complained about putting sherlock holmes into a contemporary setting i won't do that basil <UNK> could have fit in in any era with that voice that <UNK> <UNK> this is a nicely put together mystery based loosely on the dancing men one of the best of conan <UNK> stories instead of the original plot it makes the men part of a nazi plot holmes becomes a <UNK> for the british war effort his <UNK> is <UNK> who seems to die frequently enough to rival the central figure in the friday 13th films he is certainly creative but the <UNK> holmes is <UNK> watson is just along for the ride in this one he isn't given much stupidity to <UNK> in this film and that's a real plus the plot is complex enough to keep ones interest there is a <UNK> speech that is almost a parody of itself but then i can't be critical of a time and nation that was under great <UNK> if they needed to call in holmes so be it
<START> the movie is excellent acting cinematography direction and music are <UNK> it seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original <UNK> version starring ronald coleman that movie for good reason <UNK> an unbelievable level of commitment from talking with people who saw the original when it first came out i believe the impact was something akin to the first movie in modern times i have seen it it was and is wonderful but that does not mean that this version is not also worthy from the first scene the 1973 version grabs you the noise and <UNK> are fantastic especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of <UNK> la and burt music is beautiful so by all means enjoy the <UNK> version but do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the <UNK> king kong destroy peter jackson's of this year
<START> a group of <UNK> to a mysterious old mansion find out that they have to live in it as part of a <UNK> in the will or be but they soon find out of its history of everybody whom had lived there before them having either died in weird <UNK> or having had killed each other br br you've seen it all before and this one is too low budget and slow paced to be scary and doesn't have any real surprises in the climax no special effects or gore to speak of in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the english dubbing which at times is as bad as a cheap martial arts movie br br 3 out of 10 pretty low in the <UNK> order of 80's haunted house movies
<START> what the <UNK> is going wrong with disney the last years are there totally run out of good ideas where is the magic where are the good animators the good <UNK> the good directors the good okay i know walt himself and the famous nine old man can't come back but is this a reason to <UNK> out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of walt disney i never rent or bought a disney sequel of what movie however because i had read much enough about its absence of quality but atlantis <UNK> return was aired today on tv in germany and so i watch it it confirmed my doubts about sequels it was absolutely boring flaw animation primitive color <UNK> simple characters some <UNK> tries to <UNK> the famous camera with cgi mediocre music and a <UNK> of different simple stories it looks absolutely not like disney not like disney i know it looks like one of the countless cheap and simple animation series like <UNK> etc that aired every day on tv for children br br my first reaction after showing this crap was to load <UNK> in my dvd player to see disney's immortal magic depth spirit and charm again to see disney on its climax again to see the awesome art of <UNK> animation again <UNK> was the first and until today the only movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars but atlantis <UNK> return no magic no depth no charm no spirit it deserved only 3 out of 10
<START> while most of wayne's b efforts are entertaining in a fun way this film is so <UNK> edited and written it is a dud the first ten minutes alone show wayne and <UNK> in <UNK> scenes <UNK> with stock footage obviously shot in the day plays a half white half <UNK> <UNK> with a heavy mexican accent and he cannot seem to pull off any <UNK> i give this a 3
<START> a bunch of full length movies featuring the muppets created by jim <UNK> co have been made but the muppet movie was the first one of them all and the first in the original trilogy which also features the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan it was released seven years before i was born so i obviously didn't get to see it at the time nor did i get to see its two <UNK> when they were first released however i saw a lot of the muppets during my childhood mostly after <UNK> <UNK> death in 1990 i finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid nineties after hearing the soundtrack <UNK> i liked it at the time and <UNK> it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing br br one day while <UNK> the frog sits in a swamp with his <UNK> after singing <UNK> connection a hollywood agent named <UNK> comes by in a boat and <UNK> him to pursue a career in <UNK> <UNK> takes his advice and goes west he soon meets <UNK> bear an <UNK> stand up comedian in a restaurant and convinces him to come along the frog is also noticed by doc hopper the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants <UNK> to be his <UNK> as a frog <UNK> is disgusted by this so he refuses and leaves with <UNK> on their road trip across the country <UNK> and <UNK> meet other muppets who join them including miss <UNK> who soon becomes <UNK> love interest and <UNK> unfortunately as they all try to make their way to hollywood doc hopper <UNK> by max is willing to do anything to force <UNK> to become his restaurant <UNK> so <UNK> finds himself in increasing danger br br one thing many people praise this film for is the songs and i can understand why there is of course the oscar nominated <UNK> connection at the beginning and more good tunes follow such as <UNK> and catchy road song <UNK> right along and i'm going to go back there someday a poignant <UNK> sung by <UNK> never before never again the song miss <UNK> sings when she first sees <UNK> is the only one i would consider rather weak and their romance seems awfully sudden the muppets in this movie are generally lovable just like they are on tv and some of them provide a lot of the humour including <UNK> making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand up and well if you're familiar with these famous muppets you should know what to expect from each of them some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny such as dom <UNK> as <UNK> the agent and steve martin as the <UNK> <UNK> also it's not 100 comedy there are serious parts of the film which they also did well br br watching this original muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing muppets from space one of the muppet movies made after <UNK> death released in 1999 for the first time last year i was very disappointed when i saw that film which had never happened before when i watched any film or tv show featuring the popular puppet characters not only is that movie not very funny i also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the muppets as i stated in my review of it however i can't say i think the same of any of that movie's predecessors including this one released twenty years earlier the muppet movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch and since it has so much to like not just for kids that's understandable i highly doubt there's much left to say about the muppet movie that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years but today it remains good family entertainment
<START> based on the true story about christopher <UNK> <UNK> and lee penn and their involvement in selling american secret government documents to the <UNK> during the 1970s <UNK> works for the government and his job is to guard these particular documents which ultimately him about his country's affairs and practices he then <UNK> his drug dealer friend lee who has become a wanted man to be the <UNK> for these sensitive documents lee <UNK> the russian <UNK> in mexico and makes contact with alex <UNK> and they both begin to play the espionage game br br lee's interest is purely about money whilst <UNK> is acting out of anger towards the system he is involved in alex believes lee to be the inside man in the american government things start to become array when lee's drug addiction and reckless behaviour in handling the <UNK> position <UNK> both alex and <UNK> lee becomes more paranoid and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and <UNK> for everyone involved br br this is a true spy thriller without the cheesy action the character motives and analysis of real life subjects is sympathetic but very well written and the film cleverly <UNK> the real life events with underlying political themes about human <UNK> behaviour where a bigger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations well directed and intense in parts especially where the protagonists become immensely in over their heads in the spy game timothy <UNK> and sean penn give amazingly riveting performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system the plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within 'the <UNK> and the and makes it a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society human relationships and the american system great film br br 1 2 out of
<START> i don't get it i just don't get it barney and friends has been <UNK> by millions through the years and i will admit i was one of those any child who watches this show doesn't realize that what they're watching is just a piece of trash barney is very annoying and very selfish add baby <UNK> and it gets even worse add b j then you have a very creepy television nightmare then you get the children they're old enough to know what barney is trying to teach them what are they doing there in the first place it would be funny if barney and his friends appeared on the jerry springer show that would certainly be one of the <UNK> moments in television history even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it as we have seen less and less of the more <UNK> and interesting public television programs that aired in the 1970s and the 1980s what a big difference a selfish son of a gun makes when this show leaves <UNK> a big sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people but a huge <UNK> will have been made in the <UNK> of television history a message to barney himself you may not realize it but your days are <UNK> br br in a nutshell there are other choices better choices
<START> although a well produced made for television movie dying to love you <UNK> with low grade melodramatic <UNK> br br the film opens up to roger <UNK> tim <UNK> looking much older than i remember him to be who is a struggling businessman that leads an empty lonely life after his wife <UNK> who looks <UNK> like <UNK> arnold leaves him with the <UNK> now all roger has is his cats and his ad in the newspaper br br once his ad is answered he calls <UNK> <UNK> lisa oh it doesn't matter i'm whoever you want me to be lawrence then they have phone sex br br i'm not sure where you're from or when you were born but i remember that phone sex bit was played out by the late <UNK> i'm sorry but that was trashy br br soon roger and the broad hook up and have a <UNK> romance they fall in love visit the <UNK> to see <UNK> and then have some kinky sex with <UNK> son in the other room she ties him to the bed and <UNK> him br br roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that <UNK> is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around god <UNK> women only sleep with one man soon enough strange phone calls begin to occur johnny girl wants roger to marry her with absolute <UNK> and she keeps <UNK> and raving about her ex husband who used to beat her it's funny to see roger believe her through all this stuff that's until a <UNK> co worker tells him to go <UNK> through her <UNK> like a <UNK> housewife he takes her crappy advice and lo and behold he finds a <UNK> <UNK> with fake id cards and <UNK> and guns and a <UNK> he immediately takes the <UNK> to the police and has her arrested even though all this jazz he still loves the dumb broad she tells so much lies it seems her tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once br br roger goes on with his life and meets an ugly woman named angela who looks like something off of <UNK> 2 she has a child as well and roger takes quite a liking to her but something inside <UNK> <UNK> keeps him connected to lisa if that's even her real name and he keeps going back to see her br br now lisa is the ex that won't go away as she earns herself a get out of jail free card and shows up at <UNK> <UNK> and his son matt is so busy trying to check her out he <UNK> juice all over the floor <UNK> is so stupid he throws lisa out and doesn't even change the locks boy if all people were that stupid i wouldn't even be writing this review the ending of this movie is so corny you won't believe br br tim <UNK> is a made for tv movie king he just looks like such a mummy in this movie he's a little wooden and stiff the dazzling tracy <UNK> works well with her role and her rings true she is extremely beautiful and i do see what michael j fox sees in her br br this movie is great to watch when you're on that late night tip but then again you might fall asleep considering how dull and bland it is
<START> personally i think kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation maybe the greatest this in combination with another amazing actor named jeff bridges it can't be bad and that's exactly what this movie is k <UNK> is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years to start with has the movie a brilliantly written story it's part of what makes the movie so great the other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting the combination spacey bridges really works br br this was already the second time i saw the movie and i'm sure it won't be the last time k <UNK> has everything there are moments which are extremely funny parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of high class drama i think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards great movie br br 9 10
<START> in addition to the fact that this is just an <UNK> made film imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club the people who think that there is anything real about this legend need to grow up this is the 21st century guess what ghosts don't exist most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old you guys seriously need to grow up br br the fact that a fraud was <UNK> nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud the fact that a large number of <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> believe it doesn't do it either go to college or at least finish high school
<START> i watched x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot frankly i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie i was wrong the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the <UNK> starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military <UNK> throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott <UNK> beautiful <UNK> voice the film explores the identity crisis of pierre <UNK> depardieu a brilliant choice for the role and his <UNK> self destruction the story is divided into two parts  the first depicts <UNK> life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal <UNK> after he <UNK> everything and moves to paris to live in <UNK> with his supposed half sister both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic adding up to a true aesthetic feast x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience
<START> after nearly getting killed by a big dog a stray cat thinks to herself why can't i be a <UNK> then everyone would leave me alone she looks around the <UNK> and gets an idea white paint black paint and some <UNK> cheese and some <UNK> <UNK> the next thing you know we have the <UNK> to <UNK> le <UNK> although in this cartoon she's still a cat she's a she and just a <UNK> in disguise br br the cat also is enjoying and taking full advantage of her new status as a <UNK> <UNK> he's a happy content guy now until a real <UNK> with the charles boyer imitation voice shows up br br i did appreciate the cat putting on a bugs bunny outfit however overall i never cared for these french <UNK> characters finding the stereotypical dialog overdone and not really funny so i only rate this as fair i do this a point however for the moral at the end of the story
<START> first of all since i'm one of the people who never saw the mst3k chopped up version of this movie i can't comment on that br br however i did see the original version of this movie on the sci fi channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel in fact i thought it was one of their better offerings br br i've noticed in <UNK> the comments here that the people who write in detail about with a <UNK> of intelligence <UNK> and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so in it's original cut most reasonable people i think would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10 five is average to me and i think this movie is about average for a sci fi <UNK> br br in contrast to the above i've also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature dull and flip and as a result come off as <UNK> from where i stand are the same ones who can't find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based mostly on seeing it chopped up and on mst3k or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly <UNK> by the mst3k viewing to begin with
<START> so it might not be entirely historically accurate and there is little or no real character development but for jake son of <UNK> scott's first attempt it's well worth the ticket price br br captain james <UNK> lee miller looking as good as ever may be a gentleman but he hasn't got the money or the clothes to prove it robert <UNK> with all his clothes on is an turned outlaw the circumstances of their strange meeting involve a dead body a ruby and eventually a <UNK> as the gentlemen as the tag line says they rob the rich and that's it there isn't really much background or even in depth development but the object seems to be to <UNK> the <UNK> of enough money and <UNK> to pay for the two passage to america one small problem falls in love with the chief ward rebecca <UNK> tyler who happens to also have caught the eye of the thief taker general br br the plot is original enough the casting is excellent especially alan <UNK> as the drag <UNK> lord rochester <UNK> and miller also together in <UNK> they haven't lost their dynamic the <UNK> is fantastic the makeup is outrageous and the music is hard edged <UNK> with a strangely classical <UNK> jake scott has an eye for light and shadow a good sense of balance between spectacle and plot and he isn't <UNK> about showing the more unpleasant side of <UNK> century london and lucky for us he likes close ups of faces especially eyes <UNK> lee <UNK> eyes and <UNK> <UNK> too but hey who is this movie about rebecca no and but there's more to this movie than just pretty faces at the risk of sounding cliche it's a fast furious and sometimes frustrating ride with the most noble since robin hood <UNK> sleazy and violent scott's debut film makes for an entertaining evening at the movies br br as says i was terrific and it was a bloody good laugh
<START> my father insisted i should watch this film with him and i regret that i wasted my time watching i want that <UNK> hour and a half back the funny little film concerns the elderly don <UNK> staying with his son tom <UNK> it turns out that <UNK> isn't just <UNK> like he's been told but has <UNK> it seems a lot like <UNK> and because dad is so frequently out to lunch he gets into so much trouble again and again almost like the adorable <UNK> from <UNK> day out the problem though is that you know <UNK> day out is all fantasy and the baby is going to be fine plus you aren't laughing at the baby for having a <UNK> or illness but in this case you are being encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind and where's the humor in that if this film had been more successful would the producers have then made films making fun or people with cerebral <UNK> or a flesh eating virus there are a lot of people who should have felt ashamed at having made this film
<START> no one really knows how the power came to be not even the book of <UNK> recorded its beginning but those who <UNK> it have always been the families of formed a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> after this intro we suddenly see take that or was it the <UNK> boys perhaps well i don't know which of these they belong to but one <UNK> for sure the <UNK> of <UNK> are a boy band can you tell them apart i couldn't if you can tell me which is which i'd very much appreciate it these boy band boys looks so damn seriously now is this a horror movie or a film for <UNK> <UNK> it's sad that the anyway weak horror genre has been kidnapped by teens and this is one of the i've seen so far the movie is visually solid but the cast is so bland the acting so awful that it was a trial finishing the movie as bad as the cast was after all boy bands and fashion models are rarely good actors the absolute stand out in this regard was the guy playing the villain sebastian stan this guy's overacting is right up there with the worst in the history of film i have rarely seen someone make such annoying and silly <UNK> in such a short space of time what's worse he has the most baby face of all the boy band baby faces in the entire cast i mean it's a joke
<START> at one point in this waste of celluloid charles dance as some sort of meant to be funny cyborg bad guy says if i had an <UNK> i'd <UNK> myself br br quite
<START> i very nearly did not see <UNK> de hi ' i think it must have been the title that put me off in those days the <UNK> language <UNK> of 'the radio <UNK> only used to print titles of certain shows without <UNK> a <UNK> of information as to what they were actually about <UNK> de hi ' suggested to me a bad <UNK> show <UNK> by leslie or worse an inane u s <UNK> but i managed to catch a later episode and was surprised to find it written by jimmy perry and david <UNK> br br as was the case with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ain't half hot <UNK> perry based it on personal experiences in this case his time at a holiday camp before cheap air travel came along in the <UNK> these camps <UNK> up along british providing entertainment for working class families and <UNK> millions for their owners br br as a matter of interest i worked in one such camp in the <UNK> as a chef barry island south <UNK> known to all and <UNK> as <UNK> for reasons i won't go into br br set in the late <UNK> it began with university academic jeffrey simon taking over as the <UNK> manager of a job he was ill <UNK> to handle his staff included resident comic ted paul <UNK> his sidekick spike jeffrey holland miserable punch and judy man mr <UNK> leslie <UNK> ballroom dancers barry barry howard and <UNK> stuart diane holland and the unforgettable <UNK> <UNK> ruth who <UNK> after at every opportunity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stole the show though as <UNK> peggy whose driving ambition was to be a all the important staff members wore them a number of sexy girls occupied these <UNK> too most notably <UNK> kelly's and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we never saw joe the owner he <UNK> to his staff in the form of <UNK> which poor jeffrey was forced to read <UNK> hi de hi was the <UNK> usually met with the equally inane de ho br br one fan was the late sir fred who told perry and <UNK> that he <UNK> most of the characters from real life br br i always found the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic like <UNK> rice he was the comedian whose big break never came reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late night audiences he took advantage of his position to <UNK> in a few <UNK> and in one memorable episode patience <UNK> and he sounded him out lies ted all lies br br as with every other perry <UNK> series the cast were excellent particularly and <UNK> ruth <UNK> got on my nerves no wonder anne robinson hates the <UNK> but leslie <UNK> <UNK> and felix <UNK> <UNK> more than <UNK> br br the visual gag everyone remembers is drunken mr <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> horse riding a real one along the beach looking at the bottle of <UNK> in his hand he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating br br with its <UNK> blend of <UNK> nostalgia and <UNK> gags <UNK> was a big hit for b b c 1 in the <UNK> resulting in a massive increase in <UNK> for <UNK> and it went downhill when left to return to the theatre though i never took to his replacement <UNK> leader clive <UNK> david <UNK> worse leslie death robbed the show of one of its best characters kenneth connor was brought in to replace him as <UNK> br br the period setting occasionally caused problems in one episode sylvia and betty had to dive into the pool to rescue peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark the revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era still they looked great in them so who's complaining in another ted sang the tom jones hit to <UNK> it was not composed by les reed and barry mason incidentally until 1968 br br closed its doors in 1988 and the last shot was that of peggy now a all alone in the camp jumping into the air and shouting what else <UNK> de hi ' br br i don't rate it as highly as perry and <UNK> other shows but its popularity is <UNK> it was probably one of the last british sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection mainly because it featured likable characters in a <UNK> setting <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this game is from a genre of games that tried to capitalize off of the whole inspired trend walk around talk to people solve <UNK> the <UNK> themselves are absolutely horrible but i'll stick to the acting itself which is only slightly better if you're looking for a convincing performance from any one character you won't find it here but this game is worth buying if only to witness the truly hilarious performance of christopher walken his acting is so horrible in this game that it seems like he's imitating someone who happens to be <UNK> him he's a caricature of himself br br so buy this game if you're <UNK> a walken fan or simply want to hear the f word a lot
<START> the basic idea behind <UNK> of <UNK> isn't all bad the acting however is bad the lighting is bad the music is bad the scenes of torture are without emotion there really isn't much there to recommend this film you know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say special guest star and list someone you've never heard of might as well say rex hamilton as abraham lincoln because there's really no one in this movie you can identify there are one or two decent moments mostly toward the end and i think the basic plot outline may have contained an original idea but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inept <UNK>
<START> i must say i was surprised to find several positive comments to this turkey in desperate need of a <UNK> transplant i'm giving it a 1 because i think the idea of making a movie about the wild man of <UNK> jerry lee lewis is honorable but it's a shame to put out such trash and the killer does not deserve this it's a good thing it came late in his career they said elvis practically ruined his career with the movies he put out through the sixties and this could have done the same for jerry lee had it come out some 15 20 years earlier it's based on myra <UNK> lewis book and that's a shame to begin with it's a bad and inaccurate story of her life together with lewis and there is far better books about the killer that could have made a much better and more interesting script add to this a bunch of actors who doesn't know if they are <UNK> in a drama comedy or a little bit of both the otherwise fine actor dennis quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon he is walking around in the picture talking about his god given talent and as a <UNK> you wish he'd show some of it on the screen too silly gestures and funny faces and jerry lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this truly awful movie the rest of the crew is almost as bad save for <UNK> <UNK> who does her best with the crappy lines given to her it's grease all over again and whenever jerry lee take a ride around <UNK> in his <UNK> having the radio on in the car the whole town is dancing to the music from it everybody in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved from the wild man himself to sun records sam <UNK> and it's a damn shame a charismatic and interesting artist like jerry lee lewis deserves better and i hope he took the 500 000 dollars he got from the deal and told the company to go f k themselves twice
<START> alexander <UNK> is a series of superb sequences of cinematic opera that pass from <UNK> to and end in a the story takes place in prince alexander <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> knights in a battle on the ice of lake br br the film is a splendid historical <UNK> which shows director <UNK> <UNK> at his most <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds several films have scenes strongly influenced by the battle of lake including doctor <UNK> 1965 <UNK> 1998 and king arthur 2004 alexander <UNK> was kept out of <UNK> due to changing political winds and then <UNK> as perhaps the most influential soviet made historical film
<START> although compared with mad max this film is in a league of its own set in post apocalyptic paris this film is about man's struggle for survival he has lost his ability to speak and there is a remarkable <UNK> of women <UNK> luc
<START> when i started watching surface for the first time i was hooked it had everything i wanted in a show suspense action mystery great plot and a great cast of characters my whole family loved to watch the show it seems when there's a great show on tv the network usually <UNK> it like they seemed to do with this show they go by the <UNK> rating system which i think is stupid because there is a lot of junk that they seem to watch which the networks keep on the air if only there was a way for everyone to vote on a show then maybe the good shows won't get canceled when i watch tv now i only watch good shows so right now thats not watching a whole lot of tv i hope that the network brings the show back but when they make up there mind with a dumb decision they seem to stick to it i hope there's a lot of people out there that feel the same way
<START> this film is great all the hi tech <UNK> and technology is mind <UNK> it is packed with action humour and not to mention guys you will want to see it again and again very very funny also it has a very unique plot which is unpredictable you wouldn't want to miss out on it
<START> just a short comment i want to say that i like this movie very much sandra <UNK> is my favourite actress i like the whole story from the beginning until the end i have it on tape and i can watch it a 100 times it doesn't matter
<START> in december 1945 a train leaves the central station of <UNK> for berlin there aren't much left when it arrives not of the train and not of some passengers br br this is a black comedy directed by peter <UNK> and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed in b w like they used to during that period the actors must have had lots of fun making it they aren't much of characters like they weren't in the 40s but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing br br a deadly black and deadly funny film see it if you didn't think the <UNK> were capable of humour
<START> the most generic surface level biography you could hope for <UNK> <UNK> of holly is accurate but who wants to hear gary busey sing maybe baby typically the members of the are used for comic relief and melodrama smith and <UNK> respectively instead of as people or even characters when holly uses a string section the old jewish looking guys who come in tell him he's using the same techniques as <UNK> it's just this kind of <UNK> statement that makes film <UNK> like this and <UNK> about the aforementioned <UNK> so worthless some entertainment can be derived from <UNK> excellent styles and songs done in a b variation
<START> this is one of my 3 favorite movies i've been out on the water since i was 13 so i got a lot of the humor as well as <UNK> a lot of the near land scenery the movie although taking place in and around virginia was filmed around the san francisco bay most notably the fleet just east of the bridge where <UNK> <UNK> character was first introduced to the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of san francisco at the very end of the movie including a boat that i've worked on as other people have said the actors appeared to have fun making this movie as well as making it entertaining the line we're approaching the bottom sir i can hear a couple of <UNK> <UNK> it out is at least to me priceless br br i am one of numerous people who is <UNK> awaiting a <UNK> dvd of down <UNK> to be introduced
<START> as a local performer i thought that grease <UNK> what broadway producers are looking for and it <UNK> a small bit of the acting population although my favorites did not win but came in second i enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what i liked and where i could improve as a performer br br they brought in olivia <UNK> john because she is the obvious link between the broadway production and television audiences br br they sang songs from the movie hopelessly devoted et al because these songs will be included in the new production br br i agree with the earlier comment made that the <UNK> cast looks so much older but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on broadway and worked their <UNK> off to be there if the entire cast was green and fresh then i believe that would have <UNK> the casting process by which producers choose their talent
<START> first of all around the time i wrote this comment i had already read what 1 had written about this game and was confused this is a video game and not an actual movie i mean i myself would choose a good deniro movie or playing a video game any day but dude what are you talking about now that i have that out of the way let's move on shall we the video game adaption of <UNK> tiger hidden dragon is as you may have guessed based on the movie of the same name what's stranger is that this was released three years after the film was released whether that's due to a slow development time or just plain <UNK> no one really knows at least i don't br br the game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie <UNK> <UNK> li <UNK> <UNK> and dark cloud whose story is a secret bonus that is <UNK> for separate <UNK> all four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the movie however the real eye candy is the <UNK> moves that allow each character to avoid the blows of an <UNK> attack in the most impossible and gravity <UNK> ways that were first <UNK> in the movie br br the story is obviously based on the story told in the movie the story in the game is told using cg movies and spoken in a subtitled <UNK> language a nice little touch considering i preferred the foreign language track of the film over the dubbed one the story goes to expand on what <UNK> happened to the other characters during the film and even no real surprise since pretty much all video game movie <UNK> have done this <UNK> what officially happened in the movie to make the game have more action i never thought <UNK> fox would go so far as to actually go and get hired <UNK> br br the real bonus for the story is the ability to decide how the game ends what if <UNK> had all the ingredients to cure li <UNK> <UNK> in her possession what if <UNK> had not gotten back her <UNK> what if li <UNK> <UNK> had not gotten the green destiny back for the second time your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the destiny of the characters in this game this is truly the best feature of the game br br yet for all it's strengths it also showcases some flaws the enemies often tend to become a <UNK> after a while and the camera angle tends to be fixed on the most <UNK> of spots not even the special features which are <UNK> after beating the game are good enough to even forgive such <UNK> that are forced upon the player br br if you loved the movie you may enjoy the game however this game is the only way you're going to be able to <UNK> yourself into a version of such a beautiful and amazing movie br br of course you could have just picked a deniro movie instead
<START> you don't have to be a to appreciate this gem of a movie i don't know a word of <UNK> and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but i could make out the story because the lead actors and actresses <UNK> really well and the little girl was really cute she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies the story is really touching and hats off to mr for trying something different the relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically i could identify with the characters in the movie it was a movie that will remain in my heart forever and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends also the songs are just out of this world they were beautifully and <UNK> <UNK> if only i could understand the right meaning of the lyrics
<START> this movie deals with the european <UNK> exchange program but more generally about the european youth it is so true that i don't know did to reach such a masterpiece definitely one of my top 5 movies it reminds me of the famous song this is my life my life life is life 10 10
<START> you could get into the <UNK> gritty of this film and say how it couldn't happen or how could the main character just walk into <UNK> and start using computers etc without someone <UNK> and really pick the movie to bits or you could just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting personally i prefer the latter i live real life and watch the news with all it's doom and <UNK> and so would much rather be entertained by my movies and see the bad guys get their just <UNK> don't take it too seriously and you can thoroughly enjoy this film
<START> the accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix a lot of sadness i'm sure glad that i wasn't him another thing to add is that all the women in this show were not really pretty accounts of the real women but i don't think that it was about the women although it was to <UNK> <UNK> passion what a shame any loss of life is a real shame br br seemed like a good account of his life i recommend it if you are into <UNK> and melodrama
