<START> okay note to the people that put together these horror acting legends dvd <UNK> i truly am grateful and i hugely support the <UNK> but  have you even watched the films before <UNK> them as part of the collection when i purchased the boris karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and <UNK> role tower of london the strange door the invisible ray however is part of the bela lugosi collection and here it's actually boris karloff who <UNK> bela this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead bela <UNK> character is quite possibly the most good natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here the invisible ray features three main chapters the first one set in dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer's patience but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film dr rukh karloff demonstrates to a couple of <UNK> colleagues among them bela lugosi as dr <UNK> how he managed to capture <UNK> <UNK> inside a self <UNK> device the scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite rukh and his lovely wife diane along for an expedition in the heart of africa there dr rukh <UNK> himself from the group discovers the essential element <UNK> x to complete his medical ray and goes completely <UNK> after being <UNK> to the <UNK> himself the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks melting <UNK> and a surprising climax karloff <UNK> in the dark and convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life he <UNK> to eliminate them using his deadly touch the narrative structure of the invisible ray sounds rather complicated but the film is easy to follow and entertaining the story is rather far fetched but nevertheless compelling and director <UNK> <UNK> provides several moments of sheer suspense boris karloff is truly fantastic and so is lugosi even though he deserved to have a little more screen time their scenes together are the highlights of the film along with the funky images of the glowing boris
<START> wow this movie sucked big time i heard this movie expresses the meaning of friendship very well and with all the internet hype on this movie i figured what could go wrong however the movie was just plain bad it was boring and the character development was never there space <UNK> was also a horrible movie if you didn't like that movie there is no way you will like this
<START> okay so i have come a long way from <UNK> by now but whenever i see this movie i am taken back to a little <UNK> dream to one day ride the bull at <UNK> it burned down before i was of drinking age br br if you grew up in in east texas then you know this movie is an accurate depiction of contemporary life at that time if you didn't then trust me and watch the movie either you will join the many who love it and at the same time strangely <UNK> or at the very least you can make fun of the red <UNK> there is plenty material for <UNK> fun this movie doesn't try to be p c what was that in the 80's or hide the white trash element and it is honest to the time and place br br gotta be a 10 for me
<START> i see a lot of people liked this movie to me this was a movie made right of writing 101 and the person failed the class from the time lindsey price the <UNK> shows up until the end the movie was very predictable i kept on watching to see if it was going anywhere br br first we have the widowed young father cliché 1 movies tv always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl or a <UNK> of boys so the single father can get <UNK> over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children starting from from my 3 sons to 2 1 2 <UNK> these movies are usually dramas and comedies are tv shows br br cliché 2 when a <UNK> woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie and will always have <UNK> or even if that person is a <UNK> br br cliché 3 if the person in peril is a <UNK> they have to be of latino origin and they must be illegal apparently there are no legal <UNK> and illegal europeans unless if there is a ira element involved br br cliché 4 the said latino must be highly educated in his native country in this case he was a <UNK> who made 200 per month and the said highly educated latino must now act like he hasn't brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take over br br cliché 5 the crime the person committed really wasn't a crime but a accident but because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the <UNK> he now acts like a <UNK> idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a <UNK> quest to the border with the idiot side kick br br cliché 6 one never runs over a <UNK> running from a crime but some poor little cute kid this is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents br br cliché 7 name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police force <UNK> and copy cat and law and order come to mind right away and the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold br br cliché 8 let's go and round up some unemployed soap stars now i like lindsey price but susan <UNK> imo can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on one life to live as marty he <UNK> from right to left every time she opened her mouth it use to get me sea sick she might be <UNK> on land better now but she still cannot act br br the movie might have been more insightful if it wasn't filled with clichés i don't think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good but this was just bad br br spoiler now i am not going to spoil the ending oh heck i will because i feel it will be a <UNK> to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie it involves cliché 6 and 7 unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming the father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran who all of a sudden is very upset you would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake when she didn't now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him guess what happen to her times up she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father come on you all knew that was going to happen because she is a replacement child that is why she did not go and live with the <UNK> price character br br this movie was a insult as far as i was concerned because there were so many <UNK> this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the cliché ridden one the 2 stars are for 2 of the stars the little girl who i thought was very good and lindsey price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it my advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck
<START> this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie there are many plots and turns the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people this film is very well directed by <UNK> <UNK> and the fine sound of james <UNK> howard is excellent strong performance of sean connery and ed harris if you liked this one <UNK> miss true crimes or the <UNK> my wife and me gave 8 10
<START> a mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an <UNK> or something br br i went to see this movie because it was about non <UNK> wrestling and so i thought it might be funny it wasn't it is excruciating to watch embarrassing any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly <UNK> br br i admit i don't like jack black anyway after this i have been <UNK> my brain to think of one good role that he has performed the only thing i can come up with where he was o k was as a necessary foil to the john cusack character in <UNK> <UNK> jack black is one of those awful relentless flat out ham it up <UNK> guys like the little fat one in <UNK> <UNK> or jerry lewis who should be told that being <UNK> idiotic is not the same thing as being funny br br it is not even slapstick it's just irritating it's not even <UNK> it's just stupid br br i heard good things about <UNK> dynamite too but if this is anything to go by i wont be <UNK> out to find it on dvd
<START> this is just a bad movie with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better it almost were with the heroine beautiful almost like <UNK> <UNK> hero fighting almost like jackie chan battles and <UNK> almost like in <UNK> tiger music almost like in say conan etc almost but in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it maybe apart of john rhys davies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or before mentioned <UNK> tiger i am really ashamed of poor old john he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better so as you so if you still have a chance just watch something else
<START> the western society has been fed ideas about india being a poor country movies like these only make those beliefs stronger such <UNK> make it all the more difficult for indians to be accepted abroad agreed there are poor and homeless in india but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful ones br br i totally hated the idea of the movie portraying patrick <UNK> as another mother <UNK> in my opinion this movie has shown india in a very bad light giving wrong notions it is <UNK> to discuss only one aspect of the society exactly the reason why people ask me when we go to india can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and snakes br br those who want a second opinion on contemporary indian society should watch <UNK> wedding
<START> although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb br br <UNK> studying at <UNK> returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and <UNK> friend <UNK> because <UNK> practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother she has lost her <UNK> sister and because <UNK> blind from birth has been guided and <UNK> by <UNK> her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable br br inevitably the blind girl is the one who <UNK> to solve the mystery of this death though without sight she has insight though she cannot see she is able to find what is out of sight than the normal people around her the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as <UNK> <UNK> for clues in memories of her relationship with <UNK> in her <UNK> family's house in tapes <UNK> and people in <UNK> past and present br br told from <UNK> point of view the film is also seen from her point of view as she <UNK> what she hears believes and <UNK> the solution to the mystery is rather conventional but the search is <UNK> with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without <UNK> that the pat moment is easily forgiven the truths emerge gradually yet <UNK> <UNK> not only <UNK> life but also her relationship with <UNK> <UNK> sharon as <UNK> uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl we accept fully her ability by the film's end to find her place in the world more <UNK> br br noteworthy is the <UNK> by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious the dead on acting by the minor characters and the interesting decision to represent <UNK> only as a teenager i will <UNK> with <UNK> final <UNK> as stands with <UNK> <UNK> last boyfriend at a <UNK> edge but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be <UNK>
<START> i'm not quite sure if the term serious comedy applies to this movie im not even sure if this can be applied on the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin therefore i considered the movies which do not fill these <UNK> as serious comedies br br does the 40 year old virgin fit into this <UNK> that is finally up to you but in my opinion this is a very funny movie you get to laugh a lot plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations br br i'm pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there and even the people whom do not exactly fit this <UNK> may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie especially men br br the story as the title says it is about andy a shy silent guy whom <UNK> action figures watches survivor with his <UNK> neighbors and whose favorite band is asia br br <UNK> is <UNK> co worker at <UNK> he believes andy to be a psychopath until <UNK> secret is revealed <UNK> is clearly a sexual <UNK> but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre br br david is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex girlfriend whom ran away with another guy and jay a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts br br i'm pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it so in case you haven't seen it and will enjoy a little laugh with social commentary than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films br br it also includes dvd <UNK> which you'll really see from top to bottom
<START> i gather at least a few people watched it on <UNK> 2 on tcm if you did you know that hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the u s it was a huge scandal and i gather that the original release in the u s was so chopped up by censors that it was practically <UNK> i watched because i had just seen a documentary on bad women actresses in the u s pre movie censorship board set up in the early <UNK> it looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than <UNK> most sensational shots in ecstasy in fact hedy looked positively innocent in this by today's standards and it was nice to see her early <UNK> beauty it was a nice lyrical movie to relax to i loved it for what it was a simple romance i watched it after pre recording it during a <UNK> early a m i would love to see the first version released in the u s for <UNK> sake
<START> although this movie has some weaknesses it is worth seeing i chose it because of the cast and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past both portray very troubled people complete with <UNK> but make them likeable because of their humanity the story is touching but it is the performances that <UNK> bonham <UNK> jane is a remarkable achievement whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that i had not thought of before but was interesting as well for other reasons i felt the movie ended too abruptly but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending see <UNK> the very real english setting added to my enjoyment it was england in the 90's both urban and rural without being depressing
<START> a <UNK> slapstick mess posing as a comedy elvis <UNK> plays an indian bull riding <UNK> who leaves the <UNK> for a stay at home on his <UNK> desert spread in arizona where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle which is in dire need of a stud what director peter <UNK> is in dire need of is some narrative skills though what he lacks in <UNK> he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages his social commentary isn't exactly pointed but <UNK> does have a <UNK> bend to his <UNK> and there are some funny scenes despite colorful supporting turns by <UNK> <UNK> and joan blondell the general <UNK> gets way out of hand and there's too much <UNK> and <UNK> to sustain much interest as for elvis he's loose and <UNK> throughout and while it's nice to see him having fun on screen one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point this <UNK> of a picture has a distinct what the hell feel to it and though spirits are high the returns are mostly low 1 2 from
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> from elvira drawing her <UNK> of devoted <UNK> has a <UNK> quality with her lengthy well toned figure large bust <UNK> mischievous attitude and grab bag <UNK> of me generation valley <UNK> the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal as an aspiring <UNK> and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling it is evident that the elvira persona has certain <UNK> elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one liners and large chest as <UNK> from the manner in which the children of the town react to her she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level a strange mixture of one dimensional romantic yearning <UNK> sexual <UNK> and the desire for non <UNK> lighthearted fun she <UNK> an undeveloped ideal of <UNK> <UNK> for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons in the end however her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents nearly everything is <UNK> to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense fortunately i have such ability and found the film to be a delightful <UNK> br br best quote bob <UNK> <UNK> your head elvira i haven't had any complaints
<START> this is one of the most <UNK> movies of the 90's i would not recommend it if you have something better to do br br this picture presents african americans as savage <UNK> violent <UNK> <UNK> smoking <UNK> <UNK> ice cube and his <UNK> of <UNK> are continuously <UNK> toward others in the <UNK> not just the white people but <UNK> too and are never <UNK> for their actions despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white <UNK> who run their lives and stand in their way in fact it is <UNK> influence that causes <UNK> to bond with the skin heads to drop out of college and eventually to kill <UNK> girlfriend br br the <UNK> are presented as a <UNK> group of <UNK> who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else they never blast their music to annoy people nor do they <UNK> the police they do commit serious crime such as <UNK> and rape yet they're not as repulsive nor as threatening as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are br br there's a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle some of it is as follows below br br <UNK> and <UNK> are stated as students at the <UNK> university yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their <UNK> one is only left to <UNK> that the <UNK> they smoke has something to do with their <UNK> though they are students at what looks like a private university they cannot utter a single line of proper english their characters are developed only through their <UNK> whining and <UNK> br br it appears that drunken <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> knew exactly why drunken billy was taking her to his house she even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin the fact that he <UNK> her without a <UNK> became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy later <UNK> was assured by <UNK> jennifer <UNK> that she holds no <UNK> in that matter and despite <UNK> jumping into a guy's bed she wasn't ready for sexual <UNK> and was <UNK> taken advantage of by a sexual predator then a week or so later she met and slept with an ultra sensitive do <UNK> who knew how to avoid <UNK> and brought a <UNK> the director <UNK> <UNK> thoroughly br br this movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like <UNK> and women look stupid and <UNK> cole <UNK> acting and laurence <UNK> accent are the only reasons i can think of to watch it the writer director is obviously a man of limited intelligence go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want but keep in mind that <UNK> don't grow back just follow the advice at the end and <UNK>
<START> after seeing the terrible terrible terrible batman dead end i knew i had to see this as soon as i heard about it br br <UNK> play to view the trailer i thought i was in for another hideous short from what so far looked like another bad wannabe film maker trying to bring new depth to an existing character but was instead <UNK> with a greatly put together trailer for a movie that sadly doesn't exist as i would love to see a finished movie even if it was only 30 minutes long br br world's finest makes up for batman dead end and then some br br i look forward to the next short
<START> i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i don't remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i don't think i've seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i vaguely remember the theme song everyone was <UNK> cast the costume design was great the performances were top grade too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> misty <UNK> had a smoking body and that's all this movie was about pure exploitation flick i started playing a game with myself counting the number of times they <UNK> the stock <UNK> music and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes case in point casually walking into a room and saying hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic i'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released what i learned from this movie that women's low rise <UNK> existed in 1954 i'm talking <UNK> weaver in the original alien movie <UNK> at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty <UNK> taking off and putting on her clothing except for <UNK> and <UNK> sadly also includes horrendous dubbing leading to a look out <UNK> effect
<START> this film takes what could have been a good idea a <UNK> 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it nora and jim are <UNK> who go to ireland to dry out they go to stay with her <UNK> and uncle the uncle has discovered a 2000 year old witch <UNK> in the <UNK> he <UNK> her and she takes the form of nora she cannot be killed <UNK> more is the pity nora however works out a way to do so br br this is a gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap it is a <UNK> mess i have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film i am tempted to learn witchcraft in order to make it disappear br br avoid at all costs
<START> you might be tempted to rent this film because peter sellers appears in it that would be a mistake this is one of the most pointless films ever made i kept waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny appears in this movie even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it its a wonder that it was ever put on video br br i wonder what sort of contract caused sellers to be in this film i also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it and a waste of anyone's time watching it surely there are high school students who would be able to write produce a film which as a plot
<START> just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks did i waste my money hey i dig adam batman west and tina <UNK> island louise but hello this third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films crazed bunch of <UNK> <UNK> ride into a <UNK> town beat up everybody and everything and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero adam west looks the part as a hero but he's missing cape and his batman uniform sorry just isn't the same tina l looks really nervous and frightened the whole show but at least we know what happened to ginger once she was rescued from the island lol the <UNK> are a <UNK> group and known of them ever acted again or at least shouldn't have hell riders is hell to watch
<START> this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989 his character's constant <UNK> of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as big daddy or even the corny billy <UNK> unfortunately sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character the majority of the film's jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself usually over his <UNK> comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women the film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin <UNK> career pass this one up at the video store i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time
<START> this extremely weak australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the <UNK> dog experiment amongst horror movies you remember this famous <UNK> <UNK> experiment from your school books right the russian scientist <UNK> proved that dogs tended to <UNK> before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a bell a couple of <UNK> before the food was delivered to the dog and after a while he became anxious and excited and already started <UNK> from hearing the sound of the bell what the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low budgeted aussie slasher flick i hear you think well the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> killer in nightmares is an exact <UNK> on <UNK> experiment each and every single murder sequence is <UNK> by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window because he she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims so this means that after a short while <UNK> and bored viewers can afford to <UNK> off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass that way they still don't miss anything special br br regarding the quality of nightmares as a film i can be very brief this is a cheap uninspired and largely <UNK> aussie cash in on the contemporary popular trend of american slasher movies in the early 60's a four year old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets <UNK> open in a nasty car accident twenty years later the same girl  helen <UNK>  is a successful stage actress but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares she <UNK> for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part shortly after the big premiere everyone who's even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered it is truly retarded how this movie attempts to <UNK> the mystery regarding the killer's identity and motivations even though even the most <UNK> viewer can figure it out after the first murder already i don't think i've ever seen a more obvious <UNK> than nightmares and the creators should have just showed his her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment the murders are explicit and very bloody and there's also an <UNK> large amount of gratuitous nudity to enjoy however the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative the few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage the only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do nightmares is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema but hey at least i gave you a golden tip to make it more <UNK>
<START> the three stooges in a feature length western comedy musical perhaps <UNK> in the <UNK> was meant to combine the stooges comedy short with the western musical in a <UNK> if so this was a pleasant way to break up a saturday afternoon jay <UNK> as rusty is a handsome young hero and mary beth hughes as the blonde june and <UNK> blake as the brunette betty are pretty women the <UNK> <UNK> are a <UNK> group their songs are quite <UNK> however this is the 1940s not the 1950s so the film doesn't exactly rock there are a few laughs but the <UNK> brand of humor is more subdued than usual the talking horse is also <UNK> br br <UNK> in the <UNK> 4 17 45 <UNK> <UNK> moe howard larry fine curly howard mary beth hughes
<START> there's enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty <UNK> the film and its messages are very noble and i think perhaps most would agree with them liberal democracy good violent fascist regime bad open <UNK> good racism bad etc unfortunately we're <UNK> from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as i've described them br br ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws <UNK> off with nasty <UNK> who have no redeeming qualities it <UNK> with all the suspense of a badly <UNK> pro wrestling match br br jeremy <UNK> plays the <UNK> a man of many <UNK> meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close as her sister in law when the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable unfortunately the house of spirits <UNK> with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets we don't get to know them hence we don't get to care for them the result is boredom br br if <UNK> august the director and screenwriter from <UNK> <UNK> book had either <UNK> the film or <UNK> a few characters this film might have worked completely as it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a <UNK> <UNK> br br not recommended
<START> the ladies man is laugh out loud funny with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes including the funniest love song ever written br br ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role br br tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there br br it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round br br i am <UNK> to think at the time of writing this that it has a <UNK> 4 7 10 and i urge you to vote br br and remember kids <UNK> more motion in the ocean
<START> this movie was so terrible it was almost good almost we love musicals but not this one even with the terrible sound quality poor cinematography and many actors who can't sing or dance anthony <UNK> actually managed to give a good performance especially toward the end the character <UNK> a drunk lady was enjoyable to watch too br br the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and <UNK> piano music <UNK> some of the songs <UNK> are pretty catchy but not in a good way br br open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful we think it might be a good stage musical with excellent actors
<START> when i was younger i liked this show but now <UNK> this show is sappy badly written and rarely funny the three leads were all good actors and funny men <UNK> stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with as was <UNK> a better stand up and <UNK> was a better than average actor after a while <UNK> wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff who could blame him the show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors <UNK> more money br br here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show br br 1 the catch phrases how many times can one person put up with <UNK> catch phrases like with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> got it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in a 24 hour time period br br 2 <UNK> <UNK> the most annoying character ever written for television br br 3 the writing stale and cliched as an <UNK> cookie there is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing full house had bad cliched writing br br 4 three men living together in san francisco enough said br br 5 unrealistic stuff too much to recall br br 6 trendy kids the girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into br br now this show is on nick <UNK> i would hardly call it a classic i have nothing bad to say about the people involved since i think many of them are talented in their own right but this show was just so <UNK> sweet i couldn't stand it after a while
<START> this movie is great the music with the exception of the very first song in the movie was awesome the story line is awesome too it's just basically a <UNK> movie for all ages i found the last battle scene awesome basically this was a great flick
<START> or was honest <UNK> actually <UNK> at the end as he died br br loved how the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> just rolled of <UNK> tongue with excellent clarity and emotion br br and how branagh made honest <UNK> seem to celebrate his own <UNK> br br this is a wonderful film br br i have often thought that shakespeare is <UNK> not film friendly he uses words to create pictures in our minds which creates a <UNK> battle with the camera which only knows to show us what we need to think and feel every effort to film shakespeare ought really to be celebrated it is not an easy thing to do
<START> seriously i absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but i just watched this for the first time last night and it easily <UNK> itself into my bottom five of all time was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies this movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all i could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was thankfully i'm too <UNK> to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or i wouldn't be able to <UNK> about watching this all the way through in one sitting i like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory i will acknowledge this film's most positive asset it was very short for a full length film
<START> stardust another <UNK> review originally written june 15 2007 br br the marketing machine has only just begun for this one no site yet <UNK> so i doubt most of you have heard about it in truth i hadn't either sort of when i got the <UNK> i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100 as a mere mortal movie goer turns out it wasn't transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as <UNK> neil <UNK> <UNK> what is it about well in short it's a <UNK> fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star any more than that and i'd be giving away plot info which is a a <UNK> of contract and b spoiling your fun if you really want to know what it's about go buy the book <UNK> has it <UNK> might be something of a writer br br not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile and for this one it certainly was this screening was <UNK> in that it included not just film critics but also <UNK> they rarely have a mixed screening and local sci fi fantasy folks so you know the expected audience right i mean with this crowd and the title of stardust i knew what to expect br br oh how <UNK> wrong i was br br yes it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic <UNK> but it was not lord of rings it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe <UNK> <UNK> it was much more intimate than all that br br but like lord of the rings it was the well <UNK> of the film which sells the <UNK> qualities it's surely a romantic tale but with generous <UNK> of humour and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick <UNK> it's more along the lines of <UNK> than comedy before i go on let's do this movie review thing br br acting is in the very least good it's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles michelle <UNK> is not sadly one of those she plays a villain and she does the job nothing special rupert everett though he was a real jerk that is a great villain peter o'toole is well peter <UNK> o'toole which is marvelous ricky <UNK> is perfectly cast and shows why robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part when he wanted to deliver the goods though he did and charlie cox who as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ain't never heard of br br claire danes claire danes claire danes i've always been of mixed opinion with her she can be great and then she can seem to miss the mark in this she's the former and she is quite literally the star of this film sure her accent stumbles here and there and yes she's not as good as she can be when cox isn't in the scene however well see for yourself br br special effects are muted yet accomplished and only significant where they should be best flying ship yet sorry potter direction is light hearted and flows nicely cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand all else is top <UNK> br br and now that that's done br br the writing oh the writing neil you devil it's hard in today's climate to do anything original and at first you begin to wonder a kingdom a dying king a boy out to prove his own worth witches ghosts a quest or three what's new but <UNK> story draws you in with its surface <UNK> only to <UNK> it all into a <UNK> original tale of a boy and his heart and though you suspect how it's all going to turn out you begin to wonder in the third act and if you're me find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best in the end you'll find this story this movie is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not <UNK> and real br br i wish i could talk about <UNK> vs <UNK> but i won't ruin it for you for those who read the book rest assured it's done properly br br those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new <UNK> for this generation the blank gets filled in only after the movie is in wide release because well you might be expecting it you'll know when you walk out anyway i sincerely hope stardust doesn't get lost among the <UNK> even if it does it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i know br br br br forgot to add the <UNK> reveal i'm a few years late but a great film for all ages to enjoy and the new the princess bride for this generation br br perhaps a bit <UNK> an <UNK> but i'm still confident that years form now there will be the same oh i love that movie response to this as there is now for the princess bride
<START> what i found so curious about this film i saw the full 4 hour <UNK> version is how oddly <UNK> it is for a film about 2 very charismatic men castro and che engaged in a <UNK> political struggle it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire the scenes between <UNK> del toro and <UNK> <UNK> who is at best a second level actor with a slightly high pitched voice have no drama or depth and basically come down to castro telling che go here go there do this and that with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in <UNK> still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play castro <UNK> de <UNK> but he's <UNK> aside in a minor part in the second half without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers the film becomes a <UNK> epic length film about hairy <UNK> men running through various <UNK> shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end several of the reviews i've read <UNK> praise on the work of director steven soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely one in fact spent more time talking about <UNK> new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it's entirely in spanish with english subtitles this is an odd odd thing to do since a soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b it's no more than a competent job of work with an <UNK> upon nod to oliver <UNK> <UNK> in the black and white cut up camera work when che visits new york if you can imagine <UNK> directed by andrew mclaglen instead of warren beatty you'd get an idea of the dull <UNK> of this movie
<START> we should have been suspicious to discover that with only two minutes to lights out we were the only ones there only five others joined before the movie began br br there is nothing at all to redeem this movie the acting is awful especially ms <UNK> the script is banal the effects we've seen a million times the film direction the worst that we've seen meandering and disjointed no one laughed including the kids br br we left after 25 minutes it would have been sooner if my wife hadn't gone for a hot dog br br do not waste your money on this film if there's nothing else to watch at your cinema then buy some drinks popcorn and hot dogs and do some people watching you'll have a much more enjoyable time br br
<START> to communicate in film essential things of life like what is life does it have a meaning is sheer impossible of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film story but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness this happens if the <UNK> from the senses <UNK> the <UNK> from our mind i e our thoughts few directors know how to communicate essential things <UNK> is one his stalker shows images of existence <UNK> life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind i think de <UNK> and de <UNK> do the same
<START> went to wal mart and found this film on dvd and had no idea whether i made a bad purchase or a good one it is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end michelle <UNK> diana <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gave a great performance and her looks are beautiful sexy and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother she decides to get boxing training in a local brooklyn gym and is not really well accepted by the male <UNK> in her high school there is plenty of <UNK> between her female classmates and guys there is lots of action in the ladies bathroom and references as to private parts of guys if you like boxing and seeing a hot sexy gal do wonders in the ring and knock the boys on their you know what this is the film for you
<START> i recently watched this but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about what the topic was in short i had no idea what it was was it a documentary was it a comedy routine well it was both br br it started a little slow but i think that's because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was viewing but it quickly sucked me in the episode i watched had robert <UNK> discussing fact and fiction in history mainly how we <UNK> learn history that isn't really true and how we got to learn what we did he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained and interested i actually learned a few things and that is a true <UNK> of how effective this type of program can be br br i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics especially if they are taught in the same type of manner as this episode
<START> the wonderfully <UNK> ronald coleman is show <UNK> here as in few other of his films he is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him not in spite of him he is handsome witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering lovely wife played perfectly by anna lee the movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce most of the supporting cast is well known at least by face if not name and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film the fantastic mr coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters his multi talents can be further appreciated in the classic lost horizon which every film buff must see
<START> the <UNK> is confused <UNK> <UNK> that wants so hard to be the evil dead that it even references bruce campbell several times the problem is it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie this movie is nowhere near as original the plot has been used before by kevin <UNK> in night of the demons and that was a lot more fun this flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happenings br br brad <UNK> is as usual not given much to do here but when he is on screen he puts in another over the top performance that would make christopher walken jealous as for the acting of the kids it's passable but by no means good the shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric there are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while <UNK> his victims but it was never scary for a second the gore level is mid range to low but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times all in all just okay if you have <UNK> minutes to waste
<START> even if you're not a big ramones fan rock <UNK> roll high school is still the greatest rock <UNK> roll movie ever made why because under all the <UNK> it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel and <UNK> so for the boring stupid fascist establishment world of adults that final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie i have ever seen mine eyes have seen the glory of the rock <UNK> roll br br
<START> while this film certainly does possess the <UNK> of a bad film it's surprisingly watchable on several levels first for old movie fans it's interesting to see the leading role played by dean jagger no relation to mick while jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor even <UNK> the oscar in this category for 12 <UNK> high here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair i never saw him this way before and because he was by far the worst actor in the film this film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesn't mean he can't eventually learn to be a great actor another good example of this phenomenon is paul newman whose first movie the silver <UNK> is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s br br a second reason to watch the film is the <UNK> cheesiness of it all the writing is bad the acting is bad and the special effects are bad for example when jagger and an <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> through the water it's obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them plus once they leave the water their costumes are 100 dry horrid continuity and <UNK> bad dialog <UNK> throughout the film so much so that it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask bela lugosi or george <UNK> to star in the film since both of them starred in many grade z horror films in many ways this would be a perfect example for a film class on how not to make a film br br so while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over generous it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad film fans
<START> anchors aweigh is an entertaining mgm musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but i wouldn't rate it up there with classics like <UNK> in the rain or the band <UNK> this was the first of three musicals that gene kelly and frank sinatra appeared in together kelly and sinatra play joe brady and clarence <UNK> two sailors on leave in hollywood who <UNK> a young boy dean <UNK> who introduces them to his attractive young aunt kathryn grayson a struggling actress who is working as an extra at mgm though both guys are initially attracted to grayson she eventually voices a <UNK> to joe but clarence later <UNK> up with a waitress pamela <UNK> who he learns is from his hometown of brooklyn the paper thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers including we hate to leave joe and <UNK> <UNK> to their fellow sailors as they're leaving the ship <UNK> <UNK> rendition of <UNK> sinatra's dreamy rendition of i fall in love too easily a number which is sadly deleted from some <UNK> of this film and the worry song a fantasy dance that kelly does with animated jerry the mouse from tom and jerry fame kelly also does a sort of kissing <UNK> fantasy ballet which rivals his <UNK> ballet in the later the pirate kelly is in peak form here in a <UNK> and energetic performance that earned him his only oscar nomination for best actor and sinatra's <UNK> shy character here is undeniably sexy an entertaining <UNK> for fans of the mgm musical factory
<START> bette midler is again divine <UNK> humorous in love with <UNK> capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new <UNK> power singing the good old <UNK> ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been <UNK> since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide eyed <UNK> and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries
<START> put yourself into <UNK> shoes she is an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is invisible you know her she's trained three of her last three bosses knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth always having time for another <UNK> task and does it better than most despite a serious <UNK> she has the desk on the way to the <UNK> that becomes the <UNK> of half finished <UNK> of coffee begging to be <UNK> what you don't want to hear it well she can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing <UNK> br br carla <UNK> <UNK> needs a change in her life work is leading nowhere friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually <UNK> she won't take a vacation a contract is going critical so the only alternative is to hire an assistant carla <UNK> <UNK> that convey her real needs a <UNK> <UNK> man this brings an <UNK> for <UNK> that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes br br paul vincent <UNK> does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates <UNK> interest in his non job related qualities she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co <UNK> br br paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison one of the office variety and another of <UNK> <UNK> to pay off an old debt his skills as a thief help carla win a political battle in the office but paul sees a <UNK> opportunity with <UNK> skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue br br this is a brutal film noir <UNK> and probably suitable for older teens carla grows more powerful <UNK> as well as personally as the story progresses and her <UNK> gives her clear <UNK> over the rest of us she grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world br br the two main characters are meant for each other in a strange way without paul carla will remain in her role of a <UNK> she has our sympathy hopes and best wishes even if she doesn't make the best decisions along the way br br you will hear the world through <UNK> ears from awkward <UNK> of your hearing aid <UNK> sounds all but <UNK> without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking with one major sense disabled we see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> power to compensate and we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say but also what they really mean
<START> to be brutally honest i loved watching severed that's why i br br gave it a 1 10 stars because of its <UNK> unimaginative br br story filming acting everything this film was a riot to watch if br br you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them you will br br really get a kick out of severed br br the story really doesn't matter it involves some guy who's bald br br and has a sword and goes around <UNK> random people br br but he has a supernatural twist nobody ever sees him do it br br even when in one very memorable scene he walks into a br br <UNK> night club and <UNK> off some girl's <UNK> and br br nobody sees it br br severed doesn't merely look like it was filmed on video it was br br filmed on someone's home camcorder the filmmakers had br br knowledge of lighting very thin knowledge and composition br br actually holds together in some scenes but mostly you can't hear br br the actors you can't understand what they're doing and you laugh br br when the next <UNK> gets his <UNK> <UNK> from his body br br go and rent this movie support films like this they are a hoot and br br a <UNK>
<START> elvira mistress of the dark is a fun camp horror comedy in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the <UNK> and the breasts of <UNK> peterson become a character of their own br br elvira <UNK> peterson is <UNK> horror show <UNK> who learns that she has inherited her aunt morgana so she goes to a little town of <UNK> which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth morality <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appearance is of course too much for the <UNK> but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life and of course there is even more sinister evil her uncle vincent william morgan <UNK> who is after <UNK> mothers book of spells see elvira actually is a real witch she just doesn't know it yet br br for what it is elvira is quite funny film even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement most laughs come from the difference between elvira and the people of good morals but there are a couple of good visual gags as well over all direction is okay but it never rises to be anything more than that in all a good intentionally campy comedy if you like this kind of thing that is
<START> there are few films that leave me with the feeling that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film did initially i had heard only half hearted <UNK> and decided to see it for myself since then i have acquired both the video and soundtrack and have to say that after several viewings i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film it is also wonderful to see something australian i appreciate its down to earth quality that if you ask me is a <UNK> as well as the absence of <UNK> that takes away from so many films this film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that <UNK> how many millions of dollars to make a point the cast was a bonus including a variety of well known and might i add good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters it is interesting to note that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what and how they only said so many lines however if any criticism is due it should <UNK> focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were <UNK> in reality these <UNK> to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history for example on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much much more to the relationship between joe <UNK> and aaron <UNK> and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final <UNK> for the gang than were explored in the film also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron <UNK> efforts alone that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery yes this is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require <UNK> and at times the <UNK> of the original plot to grab the viewers attention i feel that in this case this is the only <UNK> however i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation it certainly inspired me to look more closely so watch it and decide for yourself you might not like it at all thats your opinion and thats fine maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience for me i'd call it a breath of fresh air
<START> don't let the title trick you into watching this movie i read the title saw that it came on in the middle of the night and figured it was one of those soft porn movies this movie is bad if you like soft porn movies then i'm sorry to say this isn't one there are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for 5 seconds or so
<START> this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in john <UNK> certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece brilliant performances by the whole cast but <UNK> and <UNK> turned in the best and most convincing of either young <UNK> career br br however as a college student myself many of the issues that <UNK> touched on were taken to the extreme in a sense that while they are issues faced on many college <UNK> they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe in some instances it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur however aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic the film was brilliant and left me stunned unable to talk just think one of the things from this picture i will remember forever was a quote from lawrence <UNK> character knowledge is power without knowledge you cannot see your power brilliant just brilliant
<START> the lady from shanghai is proof that the great genius orson welles could direct a mainstream movie if he wanted to by comparison to his other more artistic works this film has only a <UNK> amount of <UNK> and almost no <UNK> elements br br the exception being of course the final scene in the hall of mirrors widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film it alone is worth the cost of a rental br br the sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful rita hayworth her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters even the great mr welles
<START> you should not take what i am about to say lightly i've seen many many films and have reviewed a great deal of them in print so when i tell you that this film has the single funniest scene i have ever seen in a movie you might want to listen to me there's a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this incredibly stupid movie as funny as it is and to those who just didn't get well i can't blame them too much the scene i speak of comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict <UNK> to john candy up until that point i had found the film dumb confusing and it was beginning to lose me when this scene came up i laughed so hard i <UNK> my pants no movie has ever done that to me before when the project began going <UNK> was supposed to be the <UNK> movie i remember it being announced as time went on the cast was <UNK> down to john candy joe <UNK> eugene levy there also must have been a regime change at universal while it was being shot because upon being released it was shown in nearly zero theaters when watching this a second time i listened to the theme song which actually <UNK> how incomprehensible the plot is in the lyrics relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on aside from the aforementioned routine going <UNK> has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it this is almost a 3 stooges flick except it's much funnier director david <UNK> has razor sharp timing and he must have been laughing all through this as for candy who's basically in charge here he has never been funnier with all the plot devices and <UNK> scenes thrown out the window he absolutely runs wild <UNK> and levy follow him effortlessly there is a plot but it's a plot like animal house had a plot and yeah the script is uneven and a little slow to start once you know this however you can well appreciate the full <UNK> style <UNK> that <UNK> it is stupid but it's stupid on purpose and you need to remember that when you see it do see it and discover for yourself if it has the funniest scene of all time in it
<START> as a <UNK> watching another <UNK> view and tradition of <UNK> i found just married mesmerizing and delightful the idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual <UNK> of parents is difficult especially in this modern age yet this is the case in this hindi film told with humor and fresh perspective we learn of <UNK> and <UNK> who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon as said it is difficult to believe in this cell phone <UNK> age that such an <UNK> <UNK> as an arranged marriage still take place we see the <UNK> that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night and how they try to <UNK> a bond even though they do not know one another we see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment there's song witty dialog poignant moments <UNK> and comparison of new ways and tradition watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the <UNK> of the story yet it is still a delight to watch granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived however the overall movie was worth watching
<START> i just finished viewing this finely conceived and beautifully acted directed movie it was <UNK> and <UNK> as to whether i was going to waste my time viewing a movie on the lifetime movie network because of the horribly distracting commercials reading the earlier comments <UNK> me to give it a shot after all the worst that could happen would be that i might fall asleep during one of the boring yet lengthy bug <UNK> ads so why did i watch it mainly because when imdb gives a movie a <UNK> average of 5 8 who's <UNK> average was 7 3 it must be a sure hit br br i was totally delighted to have taken the time to view this movie commercial <UNK> and all helen hunt continues to <UNK> me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each role br br the portrait she painted in this film of the tough yet <UNK> human police officer was beautifully executed when the scene calls for quick witted <UNK> delivered verbal <UNK> she can stand toe to toe with any actor yet she is <UNK> at the delivery of volumes of emotional response without <UNK> a word relying only on facial expression and body language without the commercials which by design kill the continuity of any good film this would have been a real edge of the seat nail <UNK> i gave it a 9 0
<START> when you compare what brian de palma was doing in the 80's to what passes for entertainment today his films keep looking better and better dressed to kill blow out body double scarface and carlito's way are all superb works of a cinematic <UNK> at the peak of his powers the guy had a long run of better than average films this is pure hitchcock with an 80's dash of lurid <UNK> an <UNK> told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists huge <UNK> of style a stunning <UNK> <UNK> score and a trashy giallo inspired plot de palma's love of complex camera work and <UNK> blood <UNK> visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of dennis <UNK> keith gordon a good director in his own right nancy allen de palma's wife at the time and michael caine make every scene special let the <UNK> take you on a surreal scary <UNK> charged odyssey and you'll enjoy every frame of dressed to kill
<START> okay so i just got back before i start my review let me tell you one thing i wanted to like this movie i know i've been negative in the past but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film i didn't br br it's not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this and it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare walking into a baseball bat left on the floor are you kidding me it just wasn't scary one thing i was surprised about there was more blood than i thought there was going to be which isn't saying much br br the film starts off with donna being dropped off by <UNK> mom at her house she comes in goes upstairs camera pans to her father dead on the couch spooky she goes upstairs where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens finds her brother on his bed apparently dead how could she tell he didn't have a spot of blood on him killer comes in donna hides under bed mom dies she runs outside screaming for help killer behind her i did it for us cut to therapy session this confused a lot of people everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back filler dialogue ensues br br they cut to the chase pretty quick few scenes at the <UNK> they go to the hotel of course the killer is already there for some reason he escaped 3 days ago but the police family weren't informed until he's already there more filler ensues br br i'm not going to go on about what happens in the film because i don't want to spoil it too much if you want to know who dies horror fan made a post about it already but on the subjects of deaths they weren't that exciting people in the theatre actually laughed out loud an experience i've never had before in a horror movie not even in when a stranger calls during several of them one in particular the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious <UNK> face i've ever seen the only death involving any blood was <UNK> and that was pretty <UNK> her throat is <UNK> blood if you can even call it that it was practically black <UNK> on the curtain thing the only other blood was on claire when we see her body apparently <UNK> decided to stab her a few times after he <UNK> her to death um okay the movie was one of the most clichéd i've ever seen let's see here obligatory close mirror curtain boom scene check twice actually you could tell they were struggling mandatory backing up into killer check there's also the backing up into <UNK> scene but you've all seen that oh you say you want a birds flying away scare well you got it yes they managed to <UNK> one of those in here and of course the we have security on all <UNK> but he still escaped scene shall i go on i could br br for anyone saying the characters weren't stupid are you kidding me oh even though the massive alarm is <UNK> literally saying please <UNK> the building and 3 of my friends are missing i'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever the only likable character lisa made one of the most stupid moves in the movie oh i just realized the psycho teacher is here i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her oh shoot the elevator is being to slow guess i'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site ugh by the end of the film they all deserved to die the only death anyone felt any <UNK> for was <UNK> boyfriend i can't even remember his name is that bad and by that time the audience was completely <UNK> out of this <UNK> clichéd film br br there were some <UNK> the acting was decent for the most part and it was well shot but that's about it br br i'd give it a 1 5 and that's being generous just for the laughs and believe me the audience had a few and <UNK> snow br br oh and the reaction was bad very bad people were boo ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative expect bad legs for this one
<START> very bad movie and i mean very bad the plot is predictable and it's <UNK> cheesy the <UNK> of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didn't give the movie a one other than that this is <UNK> a movie one can <UNK> afford not to watch i feel while watching the movie the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of cliché bringing country <UNK> to the city blah blah blah but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy very poorly portrayed from idea to screen i think the plot is somewhat predictable at times tho the dancing i can say at times is pretty good the break dance battle twist was good if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a 5 lol
<START> i just viewed murder at the <UNK> in the newly released universal pre code set and i was amazed at how much i enjoyed the vehicle end to end most of the other <UNK> have covered the story a murder mystery within a musical but i wanted to add a few additional notes <UNK> and <UNK> are relatively bland compared to even most of the minor players and neither one really seems to have the proper voice for what they're singing <UNK> being a trained opera singer <UNK> a bit <UNK> on some of his high and low notes the great victor mclaglen and jack <UNK> play well off each other with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers yes lucille ball and ann sheridan are <UNK> girls but let's not forget the splendid jazz singer <UNK> anderson in the <UNK> <UNK> number <UNK> patrick makes one of her early appearances sounding a bit like eve <UNK> patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the perry mason tv series then there's jessie ralph as the wardrobe mistress you'll spot her also in david <UNK> as aunt <UNK> and the bank dick the music is very good <UNK> introducing the standard <UNK> for two in two different scenes sweet <UNK> with barely clad <UNK> button girls in the background blood dripping on one <UNK> white skin was wonderfully chilling the <UNK> <UNK> with duke <UNK> orchestra and a <UNK> of beautiful dancers both black and white mixing it up and i believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mix and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination
<START> very rarely does <UNK> washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for kevin kline and in this case this must count as one of their best films it is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of steve biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend donald woods went to <UNK> the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt <UNK> society south africa was the direction is outstanding from david attenborough as it was for gandhi although if there is any <UNK> to be aimed it could be at the length of the film two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie what is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras thousands of people in both films this film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of <UNK> and you cannot fail to moved by it 8 out of 10
<START> i got this as a turkey movie and was i not disappointed br br acting overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting br br plot being generous i could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it the plot broke down faster then a chinese knock off computer br br <UNK> now that was an abomination of nature it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to <UNK> the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable i have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable br br special effects <UNK> they were short bus special br br directing until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite <UNK> otherwise you will only make failures like this br br it is good to know that your friends family have been giving you 10 stars for this movie
<START> to suggest anton <UNK> of the brian <UNK> massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly in dig which won the grand jury prize at sundance we watch him and his band self <UNK> over seven years while ex friends and <UNK> the dandy warhols rise to <UNK> greatness a mobile phone <UNK> anyway br br what <UNK> dig above its <UNK> is the immense near biblical comic tragedy being played out a <UNK> honest <UNK> on art versus <UNK> and compromise for all his look at me i'm a bloody genius <UNK> <UNK> is in fact revealed to be a <UNK> gifted if immensely troubled musician far more talented than his rival the <UNK> <UNK> taylor who <UNK> the picture if <UNK> is dennis hopper <UNK> peter fonda br br even <UNK> taylor appears to realise this <UNK> by his weary self loathing voice over he knows his band won the battle but at what cost in truth they sold out made indie <UNK> records kept their teeth nice and clean and probably <UNK> their hair twice before <UNK> thus winning record <UNK> and a large tour bus and <UNK> all credibility in the process <UNK> on the other hand lives in filth is continually <UNK> beats up fellow band members on stage kicks <UNK> in the head and is last <UNK> in dig being <UNK> away by police having lost the right to see his child br br two of the best films about <UNK> <UNK> have been directed by women penelope <UNK> the decline of western civilization and this one  an instant classic the moment it was released
<START> rated <UNK> would be rated r for <UNK> strong language and crude sexual humor <UNK> rating 16 should be 13 canadian home video rating <UNK> br br eddie murphy delirious is <UNK> first stand up comedy routine this came out in 1983 back then he starred in the movie 48 <UNK> and <UNK> places and he was on saturday night live eddie made two stand up comedy films delirious and raw i preferred raw because i just found the subject matter to be more humorous delirious however is also very funny with eddie talking about his childhood and making fun of celebrities such as mr t and singers such as michael jackson any fan of stand up comedy films should see eddie murphy's delirious
<START> enjoyed the movie very much certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more and there is truly a lot more historically to find out br br did the production team fall to the temptation of over <UNK> particularly of the shooting event there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at prince <UNK> contribution to uk and the <UNK> <UNK> a movie on it's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here br br the costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one wanted badly for a british court historical <UNK> expert beyond the <UNK> of york i e did princess victoria really stuff an entire <UNK> <UNK> into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his <UNK> with her mouth full br br <UNK> never really felt that sympathetic to <UNK> this movie or indeed in her shoes at all yet loved the casting of the principals whose acting was convincing so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well i always felt like a totally detached <UNK> outside <UNK> much more so than with mrs brown or even the queen yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen except that is for some of the more avant garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time
<START> <UNK> high schools <UNK> and <UNK> have been the most popular stalking grounds for <UNK> <UNK> since the slasher cycle first became a popular cinema culture throughout the late seventies even backwoods <UNK> and <UNK> have <UNK> shotgun to the amount of <UNK> that have taken place on <UNK> since halloween <UNK> the genre as a cult horror category from early entries like to all a good night right up until the big budgeted schlock of titles like urban legend or schools out there's usually always been a campus slasher lurking somewhere in the <UNK> despite being picked up by troma the <UNK> of b movie badness  splatter university was heavily <UNK> upon release and never really found an audience even notorious hack and slash <UNK> like <UNK> lives have written off richard <UNK> splatter yarn as one of the worst of the early eighties boom i always approach <UNK> movies <UNK> because there's often the chance than a few bad reviews can be unfairly <UNK> like a dose of the <UNK> which crowds the judgement of certain authors br br it begins in traditional fashion at the place where any maniac worth his <UNK> emerges yep you guessed it  an insane asylum it seems that one of the inmates has decided that he's unhappy with the level of service at the institution and therefore he's looking to take his business elsewhere the unseen nut job makes his break after stabbing an unfortunate <UNK> where the sun certainly doesn't shine he obviously <UNK> the dress sense of the murdered worker so he takes the liberty of <UNK> his uniform blood <UNK> <UNK> and all br br three years later we transfer to st <UNK> college an educational establishment that is controlled by catholic priests a teacher is busy after hours <UNK> her students work when all of a sudden there's a knock at the door before she has a chance to find out what the unseen visitor wants he stabs her in the chest with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor in a bloody heap this of course means that there's a <UNK> at the university and so we're introduced to julie parker <UNK> forbes the lovable replacement for the recently <UNK> <UNK> it seems that her arrival has inadvertently given the resident maniac all the motivation that he needs to go on a no holds <UNK> slaughter <UNK> before long students and teachers alike are dropping like flies to the camera shy menace as he stalks the corridors and local areas armed with an exceptionally large blade suspicious suspects abound but can professor parker solve the mystery of the campus murderer before she becomes just another <UNK> br br i'm not precisely sure how many versions of this movie are available the uk altered video was released under the <UNK> of campus killings but the us copy that i own states that it's the complete <UNK> edition which could mean that there is a <UNK> print floating about somewhere i'd be fairly surprised if that was the case as splatter university certainly isn't as gore delicious as the <UNK> <UNK> would lead you to believe one or two <UNK> of corn <UNK> certainly don't stand up to gore <UNK> <UNK> when compared to the likes of blood rage or pieces so in this instance the movie is somewhat over hyped one thing that many critics have failed to mention is the charming lead performance from <UNK> forbes who ends up carrying the entire picture on her shoulders throughout the <UNK> minute running time despite amateurish direction from richard haines she still <UNK> some magnificent potential that should have lead to the chance of another stab at serious acting under a more accomplished <UNK> unfortunately that possibility never came and bottom of the barrel bombs like death ring and <UNK> certainly didn't help to <UNK> a talent that could have improved dramatically under the right <UNK> br br the rest of the cast members were par for the course of movie obscurity especially the wooden <UNK> teenagers who for some strange reason acted like they were <UNK> for a remake of grease or the <UNK> the <UNK> standard point and shoot direction couldn't have helped to build much confidence in the project and the fact that the few signs of potential were <UNK> by the clumsy handling of the script writer left the feature effectively <UNK> perhaps the only claim of originality to be found in <UNK> slasher is the brave attempt for the <UNK> conclusion let's just say that it's not a final that i was expecting to witness in a movie that was so typical of the cycle br br at one point in the runtime one of the teens says man that parker <UNK> me to <UNK> well the same can be said for splatter university which never lifts the pace above slow motion with that said though <UNK> forbes made for a <UNK> scream queen and undoubtedly one that i would have paid to watch again in a similar role so that pretty much sums up this un troma <UNK> ride slow paced shoddy but still strangely <UNK> you'd have to be especially <UNK> to give it a <UNK>
<START> you think you've had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his best work to date as brashear de niro as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him george <UNK> in only his second major feature after soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and inspired you definitely need to check out this one
<START> okay who was it who gave revolver 10 out of 10 are you <UNK> of your head on ecstasy <UNK> there were so many of you did you do it for a dare is this some kind of cult or did guy <UNK> himself sign up <UNK> times under different names br br before i say anything else i'll say this just because you don't understand a film doesn't mean that it's not great maybe you've had a bad day at work or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then weren't in the mood maybe there's a more fundamental stumbling block like you just don't have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it but and this is a very very big but the <UNK> elephant sized mega but to end all <UNK> br br please don't confuse <UNK> for complexity and please don't confuse this two hour non <UNK> for an interesting film really you may think you are pretty smart you may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure an independent <UNK> <UNK> a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep like <UNK> please don't you're embarrassing yourself br br <UNK> a waste of everyone's time if you thought about if for a few minutes you'd <UNK> it too it was a waste of the cast a waste of the crew a waste of the <UNK> and definitely a waste of the precious minutes you can't get them back you know of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this <UNK> wretched mess br br no wait comes a voice in the darkness you just don't understand its non linear that means the story doesn't go in a straight line this is actually the complex and subtle work of an auteur it <UNK> difficult existential questions and anyway they <UNK> fight club when it first came out didn't you hear because they couldn't deal with the complexity they're eating humble pie now bet you hate lynch films too <UNK> br br hate to disappoint you but i am quite a big lynch fan i rather like <UNK> so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion doesn't necessarily fill me with fear and although i've only studied it briefly a few years ago philosophy interests me greatly i don't dislike revolver for these reasons i dislike it because it <UNK> to be about <UNK> big <UNK> topics but deals with them in such an <UNK> superficial way as to be laughable i'm not much of a chess player but <UNK> idea of how chess works seems to be that of a <UNK> four year old i dislike it because the characters without exception totally <UNK> me <UNK> cries the <UNK> <UNK> guy is cleverly <UNK> his hat to <UNK> just maybe you're right i think its more likely that he just can't write a decent script for <UNK> br br comparing revolver with fight club is actually really <UNK> fight club has acid <UNK> <UNK> dialogue that makes you laugh revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one liners that make your ears bleed fight club has a great twist that makes you <UNK> everything that has happened revolver has as far as i can tell several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because well they don't make sense if you keep pulling the <UNK> out from under people they eventually kick you out of their house and then they lock all the doors and windows and they never let you back in ever br br guy <UNK> seems to assume that being philosophical <UNK> repeating a <UNK> of little buzz phrases mostly they are spoken but often they flash up on the screen with <UNK> it's almost <UNK> br br but what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clichés in the world ultimately its so <UNK> you don't care about anything you don't understand anything you go home br br actually there was a bit i really liked the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence he's great but i can't recommend you see the film just to see him he's only in it for a few minutes br br please believe me it's horrible
<START> three girls the youngest <UNK> of the <UNK> family one of america's most royal families are <UNK> at a young age right before he goes off to france to fight in wwi their father tells the oldest <UNK> never to sell the land by the time the sisters have become adults they have had to <UNK> most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property through certain <UNK> in the father's will a man named charles <UNK> stands to gain possession of the <UNK> land on which he wants to build a complex called <UNK> circle <UNK> is actually based on john d <UNK> who was buying up land and buildings from <UNK> families in new york so he could build <UNK> center br br this film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters <UNK> well played by barbara stanwyck although it's certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles seems like a cold <UNK> woman and it becomes clear that she has some <UNK> in her closet <UNK> played by nancy coleman is a little <UNK> and completely in love with a young modern artist named gig young <UNK> was my favorite performance in the film evelyn played by <UNK> fitzgerald is a rather pretentious <UNK> with a <UNK> who married into noble blood in england but that doesn't stop her from trying to steal gig from her sister the three sisters are developed quite well but as is the major trend in the gay sisters never well enough charles <UNK> is played by george brent he isn't very good well he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have but he always seems like a <UNK> in the film when we're asked to sympathize with him late in the film it's impossible gig young is played by huh gig young no he's not playing himself what happened is that the actor who had acted in several movies previously under his real name byron <UNK> was <UNK> by warner brothers to change his name to something more catchy i'm not sure who made the final choice but he eventually changed his screen name to gig young after the character whom he plays in the gay sisters weird eh young is quite good through most of the film but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audience's sympathy for him in two other supporting roles helen <UNK> and gene <UNK> are quite good br br the gay sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family <UNK> the characters are all interesting as are their situations unfortunately the script never <UNK> for anything more than the <UNK> melodrama if it had made the <UNK> of all the major characters more complex fleshed out for example the rivalry between evelyn and <UNK> or made the flashback more intricate the film could have been fantastic it also could have fleshed out the prologue more let us know more about the <UNK> family we need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more and the ending needed some major <UNK> it basically just gives up at the end <UNK> problems are solved so poorly that it hurts whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart it's also far too happy this story seems moving towards tragedy or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss and we still hate <UNK> and the conflict between the two sisters and gig is never solved as bad as <UNK> story ends <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is even worse br br i still liked the film it's thoroughly watchable even if it doesn't involve us like other great films of the era 7 10 mostly for its potential it should have been remade or the novel should have been re adapted at some point during the studio era it is too dated to be remade now the 1950s would have been the best time during the time of films like giant
<START> lady in <UNK> <UNK> spoof with <UNK> blue eyes frank sinatra is a <UNK> on a <UNK> in miami in this rarely funny comedy <UNK> by an annoying and <UNK> hugo <UNK> score and bunch of <UNK> <UNK> this 1968 flick just never rises above slightly too <UNK> to be on tv made for television movie status dan <UNK> is effective in the mike <UNK> ted de <UNK> big <UNK> role and <UNK> welch should thank her personal <UNK> the only thing that makes the dvd worth keeping or seeing is the collection of cheesy trailers for welch flicks like <UNK> fantastic voyage mother <UNK> speed and myra <UNK> even if you get the dvd skip the predictable movie and go for the trailer library in the special features besides tons of <UNK> <UNK> sinatra <UNK> the homosexual owners of the local go go bar a <UNK> that needs to be put back in the time capsule d
<START> this is best comedy i ever seen but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie overall one of best film i ever seen <UNK> benjamin and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of <UNK> <UNK> father <UNK> is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films in this movie playing many <UNK> stars like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they all are stars in <UNK> cinematography plus in this movie is playing great russian star <UNK> <UNK> and of course director of the film <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best i <UNK> this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie
<START> what is this crap my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly <UNK> dvd art and title i decided to watch it with her so she didn't get bored and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality br br first the acting was terrible they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards the delivery is sub par and very formulaic scene cuts were terrible it looks like they took it straight from the story board if there was one br br secondly the jokes and stereotypes weren't original or well played at all again very formulaic i can't count the times i was able to predict the next joke i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly subtle sexual <UNK> the cat the <UNK> <UNK> hung wong c'mon just stay away from this movie it's not cute it's not funny it's not even stupid funny it's just stupid stupid it's like a pg kids' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo <UNK> and violence to <UNK> the mpaa rating stay away br br would you like to ride my <UNK> br br is that what they're calling it now br br you could ride my <UNK> br br oh i think i got blood on my <UNK> br br badly played sir
<START> i think via satellite is one of the best new zealand made movies around i loved the way the movie <UNK> with all the characters within the entire movie it was brilliant and a heartfelt movie br br a well made movie one which i will always remember and watch again
<START> i had the pleasure of screening the big bad swim at the 2006 new london film festival last week the festival highlights some of the best independent and non mainstream films from the past year it was my <UNK> that the big bad swim was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot <UNK> in and around eastern <UNK> however as the credits began to roll i could only think about how well the big bad swim compared to the others featured during the festival by far it topped my list followed by the <UNK> chair who killed the electric car and <UNK> br br the the big bad swim is an engaging truthful and often humorous look at several adult education swim class <UNK> and their likable yet troubled <UNK> that has a depth that i've not seen on screen in quite a while the <UNK> character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which i found refreshing the plot doesn't beat you over the head with a direction rather it builds and grows <UNK> with a pace that was spot on i was never bored i never <UNK> i never stepped out of the story on the screen br br the humor of the film is something like <UNK> dynamite meets old school the acting from a group of relatively unknown actors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived obviously not being a multi million production the camera shot weren't all awe inspiring and clear but adequate and well done for the budget the lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in closer i also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the <UNK> down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be br br i sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry but i have to say it if the big bad swim isn't picked up for some kind of distribution i would extremely disappointed the big bad swim needs to be seen if you have the chance to see this film see it disappointment is impossible
<START> i watched <UNK> <UNK> one night and thought it was o k but missing something maybe buster keaton strangely speaking threw me off or the <UNK> line delivery of a leading lady the next day i kept thinking about the movie though i couldn't get <UNK> song out of my head i kept trying to better remember thelma <UNK> first scene i considered that maybe keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy the next night i watched a scene with thelma todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress buster and jimmy with her sex appeal a very funny scene the actors excellent their faces their eyes their silly expressions so i watched another scene their show is opening on broadway buster in his <UNK> innocence <UNK> every act again i was laughing out loud <UNK> keaton's <UNK> and <UNK> so the next night i watched the whole movie again and this time i see it for the first time it's <UNK> it's sensational it's sublime three great comedians todd dances <UNK> sings keaton speaks sure it ain't <UNK> but there's a lot of laughs in this picture
<START> i'm a big fan of 50s sci fi but this is not one of my favorites while the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic <UNK> <UNK> sci fi flick the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie it's clear he was working with no money because the entire movie is loaded with <UNK> dialogue that goes on and on forever i have never seen so much time killing in a movie br br there are probably less than 60 seconds of blob footage in the entire movie and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly written run on dialogue it was fun to see steve m and anita c together but good heavens how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers
<START> a truly unpleasant film while rick <UNK> special effects are quite impressive if stomach turning it has no other redeeming features like many 70s movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and <UNK> the <UNK> off of yourself the characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense
<START> if the makers of atlantis had something to say in this film its theme was literally drowned out by the emphasis on special effects over characterization almost as if in an attempt to keep up with the rest of the summer action blockbusters disney has <UNK> the character driven movie with a message approach in favor of a star wars shoot 'em up with stereotype heroes and villains br br the art is <UNK> and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images cgi of flying fish craft and <UNK> to fill the gap they are wrong and the days of beautiful <UNK> animation is fast flying out the window in favor of <UNK> line cgi br br this movie is all spectacle with no heart at times the film comes close to being a good worthwhile movie but <UNK> misses the mark so many times by <UNK> out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the <UNK> br br another problem with the movie is the pacing it starts <UNK> and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated the viewer is rushed out of the door along with milo <UNK> voiced well by michael j fox and is left thinking gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that's going to happen once we get to atlantis unfortunately not much happens the secret of atlantis remains a secret with the story <UNK> not really knowing how to explain the legendary island continent they are afraid to commit to saying where atlantis is even in a fictional story is it in the atlantic is it in the <UNK> sea who knows nothing is <UNK> even from a purely fantasy based point of view the viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves now what was that all about what was the point of the movie why couldn't the surviving <UNK> remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the present day and why did atlantis sink and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw there is nothing left to think about or mill over except the loss of money in their <UNK> br br the characters and their motivations are equally <UNK> from the eccentric <UNK> who <UNK> the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in <UNK> to the spoiler collective consciousness that enters <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> its people the crew are a collection of quirky 2 dimensional people of <UNK> for <UNK> p c race and gender the <UNK> expert talks like he came right out of a warner <UNK> bugs bunny short most of the jokes are gross one liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons they are delivered at lightning speed pacing and usually <UNK> the way these supporting players do a moral turn around near the end of the movie is hard to believe br br while we applaud disney for trying to create animated movies for adults and this is the first disney not to have cute talking animals or objects it fails to make the transition younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles when the characters speak <UNK> in the first five minutes of the expedition approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought obviously disney thinks that if you didn't know who those people were then why should you care again the movie has no feelings on any level br br <UNK> and tarzan were the last animated movies produced by disney that were done extremely well sadly atlantis <UNK> back to those failed attempts in the past such as the black <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> dame disney needs to get back to their roots a sequel to peter pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself and now that disney has discovered science fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it we also hope that the upcoming treasure planet a sci fi adaptation of robert l <UNK> treasure island will have more heart to it than the <UNK> atlantis the lost empire
<START> what a fun movie experience i was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that i enjoyed it more than my teens take a <UNK> it's not sad just <UNK> in parts finally its a <UNK> <UNK> flick for the whole family note it's 2 hours so consider leaving the <UNK> <UNK> home for this one <UNK>
<START> that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful oscar winning performance one of the reasons why i was so impressed with <UNK> performance in ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like bait and <UNK> call i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar i would laugh right in their faces who knows maybe he's better off sticking to drama because if you watch bait it's clearly evident that comedy is not his <UNK> i swear jamie <UNK> so much in this movie that i'm surprised his face didn't fall off and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets anyone familiar with comedians like bob <UNK> and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesn't require being loud and obnoxious if a joke is funny it's funny if it's not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character in real life normal people don't always have witty <UNK> and <UNK> like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in taxi driver it's important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian a prime example of jamie <UNK> that rule is the <UNK> awful scene where his <UNK> shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model if a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his <UNK> shots taken and wouldn't the police try to <UNK> him if he was there are many scenes like that throughout the film another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the <UNK> on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony <UNK> accent not funny not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether it's the right time for it or not i'm not even a big mike <UNK> fan but even his performance is good in comparison to <UNK> as a matter of fact this is the first time i felt somewhat <UNK> whenever he would appear on screen <UNK> has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more low key approach one of the few bright spots in this <UNK> of a comedy is david morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with <UNK> it in reality however fellow green mile star doug <UNK> is <UNK> over the top as the villain a big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in the green mile also playing a heavy <UNK> <UNK> has proved his directing chops in movies like the replacement killers and training day even in bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence his only problem seemed to be in <UNK> jamie foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another unless you're a die hard fan of foxx please don't take the bait
<START> does anything at all happen in this movie there are only the bizarre short scenes where i didn't know what the hell was going on so that doesn't count this movie is <UNK> boring it hurts and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies confused well i was after watching this crap what was donald sutherland on because he missed it with this one completely and what's with the <UNK> scene at the beginning of the movie can put anyone to sleep 4 10
<START> i just saw this episode this evening on a recently added presentation by one of our local independent channels which now presents two episodes each <UNK> br br as the gentleman <UNK> in the other previous comment here i agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series but i find it entertaining nonetheless br br my father was a friend of one of the principals in my hometown <UNK> for whom young rod <UNK> had worked in the media there and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there overall twilight zone is certainly one of the true classics in television and given its production during the height of the cold war period provides not only a view of this era in the country but also today a nostalgic picture of production techniques creative <UNK> and the actors of this era several decades ago br br minor spoiler br br this particular story depicts as did other <UNK> in this series and elsewhere a story where the locale is meant to provide a surprise ending sometimes the characters are on earth from elsewhere while the story at first implies at least one is an <UNK> these usually contained the message as here of a situation <UNK> by the <UNK> buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war period br br viewed today stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this <UNK> viewpoint 4 5 decades ago and still provide some food for thought as did this episode br br while the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads it still presents a simple important message and a worthwhile 20 some minutes of entertainment and interest
<START> personally i find the movie to be quite a good watch it <UNK> the actual situation of <UNK> in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how <UNK> are organized br br not only that it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the <UNK> situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out <UNK> br br overall the movie is rather violent due to the <UNK> methods of killings torture nevertheless the movie stays true to the real world thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens br br i'd recommend this movie to any <UNK> mafia movie fan another good watch would be dragon squad that movie has more guns than this as in this movie there's more knives than guns in fact i don't remember seeing a single gun
<START> it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see the <UNK> touch should be warned about a scene that's <UNK> reminiscent of the <UNK> 11 2001 terrorist attacks in nyc but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning despite an interesting <UNK> producer elliott <UNK> produced <UNK> and the long goodbye co producer <UNK> <UNK> co produced the oscar nominated l a <UNK> and screenwriter john <UNK> won an oscar for gandhi and an international cast i found the <UNK> touch to be a heavy handed unintentional laugh riot it was a poorly directed horribly written and acted mess it tried to capitalize on the 70s <UNK> thrillers genre the movie fails on many counts please consider carrie and the underrated the fury both directed by brian <UNK> they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter
<START> i have to agree with cal <UNK> it's a great movie specially for the family kelly <UNK> is beautiful the little girl is really talented and cute of course jim belushi has earned his <UNK> but want i really liked was the piano song if you're a musician or not watch this movie just for that you'll know which it is br br you're nobody till somebody loves you written by russ morgan larry stock and james <UNK> br br so have fun watching br br see ya br br nelson
<START> great movie when i saw it have to say one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the dvd as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average compared to movies that are known ad good <UNK> this is nothing i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little <UNK> which is great also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking it's like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch i like the movie overall so i give it a br br still a good 7 10 for me
<START> me and my friend rented this movie for 2 50 and we both agree on one thing br br this is the worst movie ever made br br also me and my friend counted <UNK> face shots which makes up 95 of the movie br br so in other words do see this movie unless you like wasting money and i do br br
<START> there have been many film and tv productions of jane eyre each with aspects to recommend them but i suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now it's just a classic and offers much more of the story than others do timothy dalton is utterly in his element as rochester rarely missing the mark his performance is astonishingly <UNK> and many colored while never <UNK> too far from the dark <UNK> of the character zelah <UNK> jane is more cerebral than <UNK> but she makes a perfect foil for dalton who appropriately towers over her the nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing once you've absorbed the shock of <UNK> charisma there are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better though this pretty much was a top of the line production by the <UNK> standards of that time but it's the performances that are the real pleasure don't miss this one
<START> american pie <UNK> house is sort of in <UNK> between genres on the one hand it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes on the other hand it's porno that's a tad too soft core to actually turn on any viewers essentially <UNK> house is a <UNK> of sex scenes some <UNK> others just lame attempts at humor with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at <UNK> the characters are barely even two dimensional most development relies on knowledge of naked mile and the important plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story br br in all fairness i did not go into this movie without expectations i liked the original three american pie movies and thought band camp and naked mile were solid <UNK> i thought naked mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters and so when i saw that some of the same characters were returning for <UNK> house i was excited to see this installment i was aware that there would be numerous scenes of <UNK> and sexual <UNK> in multiple forms and i was fine with it because in the past these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot in <UNK> house however it's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other <UNK> movies worked they spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story br br this movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one dollar rental the jokes are lame the story is non existent and the porno aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing
<START> this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons the co <UNK> of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments robert <UNK> and fred <UNK> have a memorable scene together near the end where <UNK> says to <UNK> you sure do get around buddy boy i did enjoy this film only for <UNK> and <UNK> but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a <UNK> in four lines and the rest ad <UNK> most likely a film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so it seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent so that <UNK> with fred <UNK> and robert <UNK> make for a film worth seeing
<START> where oh where to begin in describing the <UNK> <UNK> of neil <UNK> latest attempt at film making br br there are many kinds of film fans out there but by far the most annoying and shallow is mr intriguing you know mr intriguing don't you br br he's the fellow that no matter how stupid lame and <UNK> dull a film is he says gee i don't know why everyone hated it i found it intriguing he's the kind of guy who finds the <UNK> of dog <UNK> intriguing especially when he <UNK> it in the shape of a hitler mustache on his upper lip and <UNK> about the house <UNK> about the brilliance of science fiction that features <UNK> <UNK> references to greek mythology he's also the guy this version of the wicker man was made for no one else could stand it
<START> the imdb <UNK> state that you have to <UNK> if your comments contain <UNK> br br well this whole film is something of a spoiler a <UNK> tale that <UNK> what it <UNK> against a tale of lost youth that doesn't know where it itself is going br br i just saw this at the <UNK> film festival this film wasn't just bad it was really bad br br the acting is inconsistent the characters are the mostly cliché offerings with little depth and <UNK> acting was very bad in particular br br from the <UNK> accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place <UNK> elements to the <UNK> dialog and scenarios it sucked the big one br br i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy updated <UNK> <UNK> with a touch of <UNK> born <UNK> but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking outside of some frat level gore as the ladder br br more than anything someone needed to really a edit the screenplay br br there are some things in there to build on and clearly br br deals with a worthy subject if ham handed in it's attempt b edit the film if it was cut down to a core it might be passable br br i would go lower than 1 if i could like maybe zero <UNK>
<START> nothing positive to say meandering nonsense <UNK> and <UNK> with a message new russian post soviet films can be very good <UNK> comes to mind yet many have the <UNK> of cardboard and the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would be a good example this is a <UNK> type of <UNK> acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it <UNK> from the <UNK> of the actors special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky would someone please realize that blair witch has had its 15 seconds of <UNK> fame and takes are <UNK> towards attention <UNK> pre teens who <UNK> on <UNK> and masturbation the female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often male <UNK> need a <UNK> coach although <UNK> aren't bad rather <UNK> eyes one middle finger for this irrelevant pile of non art anyone who reviews this positively better be a distant cousin of the <UNK>
<START> my wife and i have watched this movie twice both of us used to be in the military besides being funny as hell it offers a very realistic view of life in the navy from the perspective of a navy <UNK> man and tells it like it really is we're adding this movie to our permanent collection
<START> this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word it tells a tail that here in <UNK> we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is sure it has some extremes but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art it is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them the film has a deeper understanding of greek ways of life stereotypes and social structure unlike most greek films that have a certain fast food mainstream audience this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings i am not a big fan of traditional music either but i wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film br br if someone told me to say something against this film i'd define the following sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut i guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the <UNK> and a bit for the theatres br br anyway i could write more and more to express my thought over this but i guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend a must see
<START> this film has the look and feel of a student film project yeah there are some interesting albeit <UNK> edits and shots but the end result was juvenile br br the director didn't seem to be saying look at this film it seemed as if he were saying look at me i'm a director br br thumbs down
<START> first things first this movie is <UNK> beautiful a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lighter <UNK> the visuals blew me away every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story well it's okay it's not going to set the world on fire but if you like your futuristic blade runner esquire tales and who doesn't then you will be fine br br i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and <UNK> from the movie as a whole i saw it at the cinema in english but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewhere br br definitely worth seeing
<START> seeing this movie was the most fun i've had at the cinema in a long time however i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film because such simple <UNK> simply cannot be applied this picture has everything any movie could ever have it has characteristics of a romantic comedy a political commentary a thriller a drama an action movie a musical and an <UNK> self conscious art film it's all in there adding up to a myth br br the basic premise is about an indian couple <UNK> <UNK> kapoor and <UNK> <UNK> kapoor happily living in canada who rush to india to visit the husband's parents after a disturbing news report the rest of the story takes place in india where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of <UNK> violence at one point the story borrows from not without my baby but to call <UNK> a remake of anything would be an injustice br br the <UNK> story line takes a <UNK> to a number of astonishing <UNK> including shah rukh <UNK> dream of <UNK> <UNK> which comes as if out of another movie in fact the two stars are on all the posters but they appear really late in the film and only shah rukh ends up being a real character yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance br br <UNK> kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film and she does an admirable job having to link up the film's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion another notable presence is <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> the <UNK> father of the husband <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character br br the movie is not without its share of realism violence is rampant but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters with <UNK> getting <UNK> beaten on a number of occasions at times this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but <UNK> br br i have seen a share of bollywood releases and the mixing of genres and incredible plot <UNK> are certainly their norm but <UNK> raises the bar by absorbing an even greater <UNK> without becoming ridiculous it is a film that achieves the <UNK> of a <UNK> tragedy where the audience of the <UNK> and <UNK> is equally entertained it is pure gratuitous cinema and the director <UNK> <UNK> must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book perhaps the all important message of violence <UNK> violence and the inspiring <UNK> of <UNK> love were not the thoughts on my mind but i came out of watching <UNK> <UNK> making movies can be the most fun in the world
<START> this movie is a prime example of <UNK> great resources in a film you've got future snl and <UNK> stars in their prime such as john candy chevy chase <UNK> newman al <UNK> tom davis and joe <UNK> essentially making 70 minutes of coarse uninspired fart and racist jokes the concept of a network from the future <UNK> society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes but instead right out the gate makes a lame juvenile <UNK> joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way seek out the earlier and much more <UNK> and witty groove tube or the later hilarious kentucky fried movie this movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70's sketch comedy movies
<START> i want <UNK> and jessie go further in their relationship i want to tell them that they were made for each other that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached this is about love but not stupid things like in <UNK> hills or those kind of movie this is life and i did believe in them i did believe they were falling this was so clever and touching i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there i want to go to vienna i want to see them as soon as possible again br br i have to say i was now becoming <UNK> and felt like if love was just a fake a concept but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere somehow and some when something could really happen br br i'm french and didn't know very well july <UNK> despite <UNK> three colors white now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting br br i saw before sunset the sequel in paris a few days before i saw before sunrise and their is no matter they are both masterpieces proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings i'm sorry for my english which i m trying to best br br <UNK> in france
<START> i really did like this show once upon a time that is until i realized all the faults in it it's so unrealistic i know it's fiction but it isn't even the slightest bit believable here's why spoilers ahead folks are we really supposed to believe that a kid like <UNK> would be <UNK> from a <UNK> of ancient egypt c'mon he's the biggest nerd on the face of the earth and what's up with the <UNK> a k a <UNK> and or <UNK> hair last i checked <UNK> were <UNK> except for a small bit of hair <UNK> the head and wore fancy hats br br and are we supposed to be convinced that an evil wealthy boy genius named <UNK> <UNK> can <UNK> run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> first off he'd have to <UNK> be an adult to run a company and that would make him not really all too much of a boy genius since he'd be the only adult in his class and second off why would he attend a school like <UNK> <UNK> when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend a fancy <UNK> academy plus the side plots with his little brother are so sappy and lame every time you turn around that kid's been kidnapped by <UNK> for the baddie yawn nothing new nothing new br br joey is the poor kid who lives with a good for nothing father it says that joey earns all the money to attend his school because his father's an alcoholic but you never once see joey do anything that resembles work he doesn't even mention work and his sister <UNK> is a complete moron why would she choose a <UNK> like duke who dressed her brother in a dog costume and <UNK> <UNK> him on television over a nice guy like <UNK> is she really that clueless various characters throughout the show get possessed by demonic forces get their souls stolen by demonic forces and fall prey to mental illness oh that's child safe not tea is the typical girl next door type whose only purpose is to be <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend and while she has some cool points to her she just doesn't have enough time to shine as a main character br br the animation is simply awful all the characters look <UNK> and <UNK> the perspectives are terrible especially when they do close ups of <UNK> hand and the colors look good but not stellar br br but the worst plot hole to the series was the fact that <UNK> says that his millennium puzzle can send souls back to their bodies if this was so how come he didn't save <UNK> grandpa in the first place when <UNK> stole his soul and save himself the trouble of getting it back br br all it really is is a commercial for itself the only plus side to it is <UNK> <UNK> oh the <UNK> series by <UNK> br br please do something more worthwhile like watch the <UNK> version br br 1 10
<START> this movie was awful the ending was absolutely horrible there was no plot to the movie whatsoever the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones their performances were excellent the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story it would be worth watching instead robert <UNK> and james earl jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline or lack thereof not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie well an actual movie not just <UNK> dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time there was nothing special about any of the characters the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling <UNK> drunk old man nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end when the movie ended i sat amazed amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while it never happened the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning it wasn't even a story the entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time that's it it was one day in the life and death of some <UNK> on a plantation how much of a story can take place in a single day other than the movie training day the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie if you can even call it a movie
<START> i think i found the most misogynistic film of all time <UNK> br br the <UNK> of the film <UNK> was <UNK> first wife and she was considered <UNK> and <UNK> from the garden of <UNK> because she considered herself <UNK> equal and refused to submit to him see i took those words straight from the script then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do she ends the film under the control of the faith an all male group br br other than that the script was predictable and the fx were awful apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film there was nothing original about <UNK>
<START> need a lesson in pure <UNK> failure look no further than <UNK> of the lost kingdom an abysmal dirt poor disgrace of a flick as we all know decent <UNK> tend to <UNK> horrible horrible <UNK> halloween <UNK> many many bad 80's slasher flicks mad max <UNK> many many bad 80's futuristic <UNK> fantasy flicks and conan the barbarian <UNK> a whole slew of terrible horrible incredibly bad 80's sword and <UNK> flicks <UNK> of the lost kingdom <UNK> the bottom of that 80's barrel in a way that's truly insulting to <UNK> a young <UNK> named simon <UNK> his good kingdom from an evil <UNK> with the help of a <UNK> <UNK> a garden <UNK> a topless bimbo mermaid and a tired looking <UNK> bo <UNK> <UNK> north dallas forty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> force a long time b <UNK> <UNK> looks barely able to swing his <UNK> foil sword however he manages to defeat the forces of evil which consist of the evil <UNK> <UNK> and his army of badly <UNK> monsters giants and <UNK> at one point a paper <UNK> bat on a string attacks but is eaten by a 1 2 hidden <UNK> puppet <UNK> presented as some sort of dragon the beginning of the film consists of what can only <UNK> be described as bits of scenes <UNK> up from the cutting room floor of <UNK> bad <UNK> <UNK> together in the vain hope of setting the scene for the film and over <UNK> narrated by some guy who never appears again words cannot properly convey the jaw dropping <UNK> of this film the producers probably spent moore <UNK> feeding <UNK> ever <UNK> <UNK> than on the cheesy fx of this flick and we're <UNK> <UNK> here folks <UNK> director hector <UNK> barbarian queen presents this <UNK> mash in a hopelessly confused <UNK> and cliched manner destroying any possible hint of clear linear storytelling the acting is dreadful the production levels below shoe string and the plot is one tired cliche after another <UNK> before our weary eyes that they actually made a sequel makes the <UNK> brain <UNK> james <UNK> braveheart titanic the rock cheesy <UNK> from battle beyond the stars was lifted screaming and kicking and mercilessly <UNK> onto this turkey bet this one doesn't pop up on his resume folks you gotta see this to believe it the <UNK> says as a <UNK> rent when there is nothing else to watch well it's moore fun than watching dust <UNK> mate barely <UNK>
<START> during a <UNK> night i was switching through the channels found this embarrassment of a movie what were they thinking br br if this is life after remote control for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> no wonder she's gone nowhere br br and why did david keith take this role it's pathetic br br anyway i turned on the movie near the end so i didn't get much of the plot but this must've been the best part this nerdy college kid brings home this <UNK> ish girl this scene is straight out of the comic books or the cheap porn movies she calls the mother <UNK> <UNK> and kisses the father oh i didn't expect tongue great lines br br after this i had to see how it ended br br well of course this bitch from hell has a <UNK> past so the <UNK> team is upstairs and yes they surround her and yes yes the kid blows her brains out <UNK> br br this is must see tv br br
<START> this movie is just not worth your time its <UNK> upon new age <UNK> serves as its only semi interesting distraction the plot is one that has been re <UNK> countless times br br i was only <UNK> to even spend the time to put in a comment when i noted that some have tried to prop up the reputation of this drivel their motivation <UNK> is dubious since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults but at its well <UNK> message of new age consciousness br br so would it be alright for some twenty to thirty <UNK> christians or <UNK> <UNK> to pour in positive ratings about movies television that support their views in spite of the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis i hope not br br i am sure the followers will come right behind me to say <UNK> things about this movie in spite of the truth
<START> this is not a horror film but a boring sex movie a very bad movie to be avoided by any serious horror fan no plot awful acting and annoying music if you only watch the trailer you will know enough it's a shame that such thing is available on vhs or video while there are so many good movies <UNK> if you like vampires try the hammer productions or the italian gothic from mario <UNK> and antonio <UNK> instead those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash rating even 1 is too much and believe me i am not the only one with this opinion
<START> most people when they think of <UNK> cinema look to the b w german films of the silent and early sound <UNK> films that <UNK> <UNK> angles extreme <UNK> of light and dark exaggerated performance and occasional uses of <UNK> to create a <UNK> atmosphere in order to <UNK> from traditional <UNK> <UNK> of cinematic representation if we're willing to accept that the germans were not the only filmmakers to create <UNK> cinema and that those above mentioned characteristics are not <UNK> for <UNK> film then i would argue that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a prime example of this type of film br br like dreams <UNK> is a little unhinged for a kurosawa film <UNK> as it does in the unreal however <UNK> is also unlike dreams a great film and probably my favorite kurosawa picture why mostly i think it's the colors this was i believe <UNK> first color film and the man <UNK> the movie with vibrant primary colors creating a completely unreal contemporary japan we are used to the <UNK> lights and <UNK> tokyo <UNK> we are not used to a city that appears to have been colored with <UNK> br br <UNK> is as i said a peculiar film <UNK> as many of its characters live in a <UNK> appearing to live in an alternate universe that is i think the point these are the tokyo <UNK> the people left behind during the great move forward following world war ii the film also represents one of <UNK> more heartfelt movies there is genuine sentiment here and genuine pathos such as when the boy's father describes their dream home it's an amazingly moving film from a man better known for stunning john ford like <UNK> and <UNK> everyone should have known kurosawa had in him a movie as touching and thought provoking as this <UNK> <UNK> the emotional <UNK> of this film in many ways br br i will also argue to the last that this is <UNK> greatest achievement his samurai films though capable pictures pale in comparison to works by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the greatest most intelligent samurai film committed to celluloid <UNK> hidden <UNK> seven samurai <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ran are all fine films but they're merely good and frankly i think that word is too generous for hidden <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is a great movie as is <UNK> they are the crown <UNK> that show <UNK> was not a one trick samurai <UNK> they reveal his artistry and <UNK> of cinema
<START> a young american woman visits her irish roots and <UNK> off a <UNK> witch who is out to possess her sounds intriguing but after an interesting start i got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going the movie seems to be <UNK> in two directions are we watching the <UNK> of the irish american woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past the director can't seem to decide the two doesn't seem to <UNK> and in the end you get nowhere this could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end this was most boring and disappointing
<START> probably my all time favorite movie a story of <UNK> sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but it's not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul <UNK> performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressed up <UNK> than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they'd all be up for this movie
<START> 25 000 <UNK> clues deep blue sea tremors <UNK> eight <UNK> freaks br br <UNK> category movies that were funnier and more thrilling than snakes on a plane br br hell with that definition i'd have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and <UNK> in airplane as superior to snakes in both laughs and thrills br br the sad truth is that this isn't even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies <UNK> besides the never to be seen again casting of <UNK> cube o wilson <UNK> <UNK> in the same flick you had jon voight pulling off the all time cinematic heist his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a so ludicrous it's fun movie br br in the end snakes on a plane is definitive proof that studio <UNK> and <UNK> make the worst <UNK> possible every big scene had been discussed and <UNK> so much the last year all that was left to <UNK> by opening night was the amount of <UNK> flop sweat that had to be <UNK> up at my theater i heard more forced laughs here than at a studio <UNK> for according to jim
<START> kim basinger stars as della a housewife who has twin children <UNK> and <UNK> played by luke <UNK> and erika <UNK> <UNK> and an abusive jerk for a husband kenneth played by craig <UNK> br br the movie opens on christmas eve kenneth is on his way home from work driving a nice car too i might add he is on his <UNK> arguing with a business partner i would assume when he gets home he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about this <UNK> him even more and he takes up with his wife della asking her why the house is always a mess he <UNK> her up against the wall the <UNK> watch from the stairs he punches the wall leaving a hole in it and walks away she tends to the children trying to comfort them after that is all said in done she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of <UNK> paper she gets there and the parking lot is full because there is a lot of last minute <UNK> there while she is looking for a parking space she notices a car taking up two spaces and this <UNK> her she finally finds a spot to park makes her way over to the <UNK> car and leaves a note under the <UNK> calling the owner a selfish jerk then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping br br when she finally does leave the mall it is closing and many people have left already not the owner of the car she left the note on however and she notices this on the way to her vehicle she also notices that the note she left under the <UNK> is no longer there odd when she gets to her vehicle she gets in to start it up she notices a car coming up behind her and it <UNK> her from backing up she gets out of the car only to be confronted by the owner of the car <UNK> played by lukas <UNK> she left the note on and a <UNK> of his thug friends yelling ensues and a mall cop no not paul <UNK> makes his way over to them to see what the problem is only to have his brains blown out of his head by <UNK> while this happens della jumps in her vehicle starts it and drives over the <UNK> in front of her <UNK> and his <UNK> hop in his car and give chase della ends up crashing her vehicle into a <UNK> pile at a <UNK> development but she is <UNK> she manages to make it to the back of her vehicle open up the <UNK> and grab a <UNK> before the thugs get there br br with that della spends the rest of the night trying to <UNK> and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her <UNK> as weapons the first kill in my opinion is the best the first kill that della performs anyway the last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was <UNK> br br i will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and i was let down a bit myself as a whole though it was a fun flick and moves along nicely at it's 1 hour and 20 minute run time
<START> after watching this film last night on sundance i realized that much of <UNK> style was first done in this film here we have many of the same elements of the <UNK> series especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural instead of the cursed <UNK> we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film in fact the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed <UNK> in <UNK> to mind the only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through <UNK> later films the final scenes are quite chilling with a bit of a nod to <UNK> what with the door opening by itself <UNK> the ghost entering the room reminds me <UNK> of br br <UNK> a chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a <UNK>
<START> screwball comedy about romantic <UNK> in new york city peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture he <UNK> them yet audrey hepburn is naturally put a notch above the others because after all she's the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior he shoots her in loving close ups gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard boiled soft boiled ben <UNK> and allows her room to <UNK> throughout the love connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though i did tire of john <UNK> tv <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> camp dorothy <UNK> and the grounded <UNK> sensual <UNK> <UNK> are all exciting to watch but it's really <UNK> valentine and she absolutely <UNK> from
<START> the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing <UNK> powell <UNK> by tommy <UNK> and his orchestra featuring <UNK> <UNK> buddy rich and frank sinatra red <UNK> shares top billing with powell and he and sidekick bert <UNK> are given most of the comedic minutes although <UNK> is more effective when he if it can be believed performs as <UNK> love interest with virginia o'brien actually providing most of the film's humor as the <UNK> companion the technical brilliance of powell is <UNK> during one incredible scene within which buddy rich contributes his <UNK> skills and which must be viewed several times in order to <UNK> one's breathing to catch up with her <UNK> director edward <UNK> <UNK> his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to rule the affair as is appropriate
<START> hatred of a minute is arguably one of the better films to come out of <UNK> in recent years not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means but it's definitely worth a watch br br hatred chronicles the <UNK> adventures of eric <UNK> played by director <UNK> a <UNK> abused child now grown up and starting to listen to his evil side br br hatred is very nice visually the shots are creative and the lighting is <UNK> moody and interesting to look at this film actually has an element of production value to it unlike other recent <UNK> releases like dark tomorrow and biker zombies subtle <UNK> shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film's <UNK> 000 budget br br however hatred stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do and that's in the story and character department essentially things just kind of happen eric <UNK> doesn't <UNK> at all basically he's always been crazy it's just that people are starting to notice the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development also the ending is very abrupt br br however since this is a horror film since when do we care about plot we just want to see people die and hatred certainly delivers as the body count <UNK> people in the theater started cheering kill her kill <UNK> all when people scream back at the screen it's always fun br br that's the place where hatred succeeds it's fun and in the end that's all that really matters
<START> delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age <UNK> whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war 11 england br br lansbury was about age <UNK> at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part she is jessica <UNK> again but this time it's for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril br br the film follows the adventures of miss price lansbury and david <UNK> as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on <UNK> those 3 little <UNK> sent to live with price to escape the london <UNK> are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age br br too bad that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and sam <UNK> are given so little to do in this endearing film br br i really thought of the ben stiller film night at the museum at the end of the film when the <UNK> come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british <UNK> town
<START> i saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s 70s yes it is gruesome and could be the <UNK> of the faces of death series popular in the 80s 90s considering the state of so called driver education these days this one should be required viewing for everyone preparing to learn to drive when you see violent death in all its gore horror you certainly if you have any sensibility at all get a <UNK> perspective on the <UNK> required to drive safely what one instant of <UNK> or <UNK> at the wheel can do i worked for bell <UNK> in the 70s 80s and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class i found this film in the company library showed it at the session a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room incredibly most of them later said i never knew a car accident could be so terrible this film and another red <UNK> is certainly reality in its most graphic form i'll never forget it i only wish i could have found a copy when my children were attending <UNK> ed in high school
<START> i have watched this movie well over 100 200 times and i love it each and every time i watched it yes it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as camp really is a great place to spend the summer everyone who has ever gone to camp wanted to go to camp or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids
<START> i was watching this when my wife called to <UNK> from the other room as to my choice of fare my comment i am watching my life br br though younger but only by 5 years or so than the rocket boys i remember the absolute urgency with which <UNK> was <UNK> by our <UNK> of education and how the whole science fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the <UNK> <UNK> my own <UNK> landed me in my own <UNK> science fair in physics by <UNK> though our group was less successful in gaining the support of for example <UNK> we approached for <UNK> and <UNK> until after a tragic event our city went so far as to allow us to tour the <UNK> missile site on <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie brought it all back for me and i will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us <UNK> of the late <UNK> and early 60's br br we are in a similar science brain <UNK> period now and really need this movie as a country see it
<START> the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed <UNK> <UNK> lyrical work is a sweet <UNK> to all those who like the colonel suffer under the <UNK> of a cynical and hardened society that <UNK> itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose unlike the absurdity of waiting for <UNK> the <UNK> wait for the arrival of his <UNK> gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life two things in the film drive the colonel who is masterfully played by <UNK> <UNK> the hope that his military <UNK> will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son <UNK> died for a noble cause a reason other than a drunken <UNK> at a <UNK> <UNK> unable to realize the former and forced to prove to the world the latter the colonel does the only thing he can do set about training his son's fighting <UNK> the <UNK> is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the colonel and his <UNK> wife but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner <UNK> in a tense scene of confrontation between the colonel and <UNK> his son's killer the colonel is offered by <UNK> a paid government agent money enough to equal the <UNK> full <UNK> but this is blood money <UNK> money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals and to <UNK> to the world that the warrior <UNK> son was <UNK> because he wrote for an underground paper that <UNK> the rights of labor <UNK> and the common man with maximum dignity the colonel rejects <UNK> offer picks up his fighting <UNK> and walks away as <UNK> as his old legs can carry him once he is at home <UNK> lola his <UNK> wife wants to know why the colonel refused the money when both of them are starving in response to her continued question what are we going to eat until november when the <UNK> season begins the colonel responds <UNK> <UNK> is what the poor and <UNK> have been eating all of their lives and <UNK> is a meal that the colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who <UNK> him the colonel waits as the only man of honor and <UNK> in a world without principles
<START> rachel mcadams cillian murphy wes craven the dream team this is one of the best thrillers of 2005 a great plot a great twist a great eye candy this is one of wes craven's greatest movies apart from scream and a nightmare on elm street this could be the best the plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple lisa <UNK> mcadams a struggling hotel manager boards a late red eye back to la little does she know that she has been followed by jackson <UNK> aka jack the <UNK> murphy they have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the <UNK> of <UNK> security who is staying in <UNK> hotel and what does this have to with lisa well she would have to move his room to the top <UNK> so they can bomb him if she doesn't <UNK> will murder her father brian cox the twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra <UNK> and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it overall definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005 definitely worth the see br br 3 1 2 out of 4 stars
<START> this was surely the stupidest <UNK> most repulsive film i have seen in quite some time i was tempted to turn off the vcr but as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident i literally found it <UNK> <UNK> in every <UNK> way and <UNK> it out through to the end i am by no means a <UNK> who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen animal house <UNK> there's something about mary both american pie movies and even the notorious freddy got <UNK> i have found highly enjoyable on their own crude terms <UNK> van <UNK> breast <UNK> <UNK> bath is the most horrifying appearance by a naked <UNK> since the shining <UNK> edited and shot with incredibly annoying performances from <UNK> <UNK> and jason <UNK> the film ended without the benefit of having made me giggle once the only useful purpose for the film is as a <UNK> example of how not to make a gross out picture oh and it would also serve nicely as a lawn <UNK>
<START> a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers norman and paul brad pitt and craig <UNK> whose <UNK> father tom <UNK> is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing and for him and his sons there is a fine line between the two this story describes the slow progression of the <UNK> lives and how their lives separate on two different paths it is a touching movie narrated by the director robert redford playing the elderly norman and <UNK> on times long gone and people long dead br br certain themes <UNK> in the movie such as memory death eternity and dreams most of these themes <UNK> around the almost tragic hero of paul he is a capable charming and brave man but has his fatal flaws br br the closing lines sum up the point of the movie then in the <UNK> half light of the canyon all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big <UNK> river and a four count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise eventually all things <UNK> into one and a river runs through it the river was cut by the world's great <UNK> and runs over rocks from the basement of time on some of those rocks are timeless <UNK> under the rocks are the words and some of the words are theirs i am haunted by waters
<START> this was by far the best war documentary ever made from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence olivier described the horrific events in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'the day the soldiers <UNK> to the final days of the war when the <UNK> clouds appeared over japan i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was screened way back in 1974 each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail this whole series should be <UNK> viewing for as many of the world's children as possible so that the tragedy of world war two is not repeated and that <UNK> hatred greed and <UNK> are not confused with <UNK> or religious <UNK>
<START> i have just managed to get hold of the <UNK> region 3 dvd of the five <UNK> and what a super job they have made of it a fantastic <UNK> <UNK> transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan br br the story is pretty straight forward and has been mentioned already so i won't go into it again needless to say it's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for and they do not disappoint only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over <UNK> bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time all kicks and punches come with the all important type writer <UNK> and air <UNK> which is a cool effect though quite amusing br br i give this movie a b good but not great in a way i feel it could have been that bit better golden swallow by the same director a decade earlier had as good a story and better action
<START> i'll probably get a lot of <UNK> for hating this movie guess i didn't approach it with the proper <UNK> eyed nostalgia of the generation before me but suffice it to say st <UNK> fire was pretty crap freaking <UNK> even as far as brat pack films go br br here is yet another lovely example of the smug self indulgent <UNK> that is everything 80s rent anyone the plot is virtually non existent and the <UNK> are <UNK> at best poorly delivered the rest of the time the complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn't help the situation there really was no growth no forward movement at all even the climactic suicide scene was <UNK> <UNK> by once again <UNK> to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in br br each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the <UNK> most predictable way possible the stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a stalker and <UNK> <UNK> is gorgeous the jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is well a jackass the gorgeous slut hides really <UNK> deep pain with a wild lifestyle the poet <UNK> and <UNK> around for a full 3 4 of the film until he can reveal he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and <UNK> the virgin finally becomes a whole happy human being after getting every <UNK> desire of one hot roll in the sack with a jackass before he <UNK> her to really change for real this time the cheating bastard <UNK> until it is time for him to get caught and finally the feminist go around <UNK> holy water on any soul that <UNK> commitment br br which brings me to my final <UNK> what bond of super <UNK> was holding these people together as friends i can't imagine being with just one of them now think of the <UNK> created by all that <UNK> centered in one bar and they were all so terrible to each other heads in <UNK> near rape and sleeping around with <UNK> the <UNK> was after two <UNK> act like total <UNK> after <UNK> the feminist she's like <UNK> actually i don't want to be with either of you anymore let's be friends and we can hang out in a totally <UNK> way every day knowing that i may hook up with one or the other at any given point but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment not that word and they all smile as if to say <UNK> gee i never thought of that what a great idea br br only it's not kinda in the way that watching this movie is not
<START> last year's remake of 'the hills have <UNK> was one of the better attempts to update the vaguely <UNK> horror flicks of the 1970s for a new audience alexandre <UNK> allowed for an admirable degree of character development and when the violence started it was mean and savage and all carried out in a landscape of impeccable photography and production design i was one of the few people who actually thought that it was better than the original and looked forward to a second visit to the particularly dark and cruel world of the savage desert mutants br br 'the hills have eyes <UNK> released just a year after the original seems a rushed and ill conceived attempt to cash in on the franchise with little thought to quality jonathan craven's screenplay could have been written in a weekend and given the speed with which this movie made it into cinemas probably was it falls back on every hackneyed genre cliché in the book while offering absolutely nothing new to the desert mutant mythology i always let out a <UNK> of disappointment when a sequel <UNK> <UNK> characters with the military soldiers are always so <UNK> written and never fail to thoroughly bore with crude caricatures of <UNK> macho <UNK> in my mind <UNK> was the only movie to successfully make such a transition due to james <UNK> talent not simply for directing the best action sequences around but never forgetting that an audience has to care about the people being butchered he was also <UNK> <UNK> by some genuinely talented actors with 'the hills have eyes <UNK> it's clear that video director martin <UNK> is no james cameron and the cast of television bit <UNK> haven't the talent or even the <UNK> to turn their cardboard <UNK> characters into anything approaching living breathing human beings br br needless to say every character is a broad and generic cliché they act in dumb and illogical ways making dumb and illogical decisions that lead them to predictably dumb and illogical deaths the latter half of the movie becomes just another tedious chased through dark corridors scenario 'the <UNK> on which sam <UNK> <UNK> also worked as cinematography proved that even this most derivative of sequences can still be carried out with genuine originality and suspense but we see no such <UNK> here br br 'the hills have eyes <UNK> is just a very lazy movie devoid of any suspense tension or surprise with not a single individual involved remotely interested in producing anything of quality it's a tame and tired excuse for a sequel and deserves to spend the rest of its life in a <UNK> bargain bin
<START> cheesy script cheesy one liners timothy <UNK> performance a little over the top david duchovny still seemed to be stuck in his fox <UNK> mode no chemistry with his large <UNK> female co star he needs gillian anderson to shine he does not seem to have any talent of his own
<START> even though the book wasn't strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of japan i find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it didn't feel japanese in the slightest almost everything about it was terrible i will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldn't stand a chance of saving it before the film started i was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a friday night shortly after the movie had opened in japan 30 minutes in i was amazed they stayed i stayed so i would have the right to criticize it the whole movie was <UNK> my <UNK> and <UNK> laughs of disbelief from my japanese girlfriend everyone i saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces br br to the makers of this movie you owe me two hours
<START> i've just purchased the restored version of a film that i remember with much affection from childhood and it's certainly made for a curious <UNK> entertainment <UNK> definitely makes more sense in its complete form the deleted scenes especially those with <UNK> link events together quite neatly what is a little <UNK> is the way the scenes have been <UNK> clearly the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged so some bright spark at disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue which would have been great except that half the cast weren't around to do it some for better reasons than others and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it some of the lip <UNK> is pretty poor and david <UNK> voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like david <UNK> there's actually a hint of german in it i think however good to hear the full versions of all the songs although <UNK> in the right <UNK> is still absent and the moments of magic in this film still shine through and i challenge you not to giggle when young paul <UNK> so <UNK> at angela lansbury and <UNK> but what's that got to do with my <UNK>
<START> if this is someone's favorite movie they need some serious help there is nothing funny or clever about this <UNK> i haven't seen the original movie this is the remake of some 1950s film but it simply has to be better than this newer <UNK> br br a major gets kicked out of the military for being a <UNK> element and winds up teaching children at an <UNK> school unfortunately the major is <UNK> wayans so the children are in for a world of annoying <UNK> <UNK> can wayans whip these losers into shape can they get him to become a little more human the film bombs as most wayans films do with only a few <UNK> moments william <UNK> gets about one minute of screen time fair too little this charming old man known best to me as a tales from the crypt actor known best to you as uncle louis from christmas vacation shines every moment he's on screen which isn't much here br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also makes an appearance as a biker which fits him perfectly i wouldn't mind slightly more <UNK> <UNK> but i think he carried the role of biker about as far as it could be carried for a military film br br and then there's the attractive teacher who someone falls for major payne even though he treats the kids poorly has no social skills and is simply impossible to <UNK> into someone you would want to spend time with she must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate i'm not sure which though it would seem stupid since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough br br wayans had one shining moment a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves including a very nice robot and with the help of music from 2 live crew this scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog <UNK> br br seriously avoid this film if you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes rent or buy ernest goes to camp at least he's a lovable loser and actually funny maybe if major payne had fought a <UNK> i'd feel better but he didn't forget payne forget wayans you can do so much better

<START> the most positive thing i can say for this dull witted local comedy production is that it's <UNK> in fact it's so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of re writes by <UNK> it went through to have such a complete <UNK> of personality it's not witty it's not entertaining it's not insightful and it's not charming it's just a <UNK> <UNK> progression of four losers who must change their ways and their attitudes towards women to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding br br with acting that would be sub par for the local amateur <UNK> society a plot line so tired it'd make a forty third season of <UNK> <UNK> look fresh and jokes about as humorous as watching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wedding nonetheless scored ten yes 10 nominations in the <UNK> film awards recently br br fortunately somebody saw sense and it didn't win any
<START> i don't like sean <UNK> directing very much and this early work the indian runner is no exception the movie has no core it's colored with a kind of redneck anti <UNK> <UNK> that in all honesty <UNK> most of <UNK> work his latest work even more so than the earlier frank miller robert rodriguez clint eastwood sean penn the whole lot seem to produce such <UNK> banal product ostensibly in some <UNK> to honesty but ending up being for the most part <UNK> pro wrestling matches and <UNK> almost as if hallmark cards had developed a line of <UNK> angels <UNK> and make me long for the days of deliverance which is a fine movie viggo <UNK> acting is much much more believable here than that ridiculous eastern promises thing he did with <UNK> and that's about it the movie is dead meaningless and seems to be an exercise a series of techniques more than a story kudos for charles bronson however who proves he can act and i wanted more of sandy <UNK> character a lousy 3 out of 10 for this the indian runner crap
<START> this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen king's great novel features outstanding central performances by <UNK> <UNK> fred <UNK> who sadly died few years ago and denise crosby and some really gruesome gore effects director mary <UNK> has a wonderful sense of visual style and manages to make this one of the few versions of king's work that is not only worth seeing but genuinely unnerving the depiction of the zombie child gage <UNK> hughes later in new nightmare is equally noteworthy as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky as for the people who think that this one isn't scary watch it alone in the dark eventually with your <UNK> girlfriend and i guarantee you that pet sematary will creep you out some horror movies like this one or the texas chain saw massacre shouldn't be watched in group recommended for horror fans
<START> takashi <UNK> had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film <UNK> on the grudge while i haven't seen that film i would have to <UNK> that there's more imagination and originality or some rip off originality in other words skill with known <UNK> of the japanese ghost movie than in his own directed remake maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of <UNK> appeal or i would guess <UNK> for an american audience what starts off with some potential the hint of something very screwed up going on with bill <UNK> sudden movement just goes into a total <UNK> and as a horror movie <UNK> a break br br tension could have been built on the situation a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted but he <UNK> everything he wants to get his audience to feel scares <UNK> about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something a black cat yeah why not just make the ghost boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which in effect is only creepy if you want cats plot why not just <UNK> between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told meaning while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be <UNK> with the story overall they aren't or for that matter have us care about anyone in the cast br br by the time the characters or those that are there for exposition get around to telling us what is going on or whatever there's little point to care the film making is shoddy i e the <UNK> degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked <UNK> especially is disappointing but <UNK> who shows up later after his first scene is sorely miscast even when <UNK> tries for some average old boo scares like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the grudge ghost it's still silly just watch when she's going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots either you'll go with it and if so more power to you or you'll laugh hysterically at the results count me in the latter br br i'm not totally sure where this project went wrong was it <UNK> having to <UNK> it for the studios or him not giving enough <UNK> with his <UNK> of his vision or maybe <UNK> had some say in it and made things more confusing and or dull than they would be with someone else the grudge gives us a lot of information that doesn't make sense or at the least give us some horror fodder to chew on it's <UNK> trash of a sad order
<START> what the is this this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i <UNK> this film for 0 <UNK> and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks br br who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldn't possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care they didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension the director stephen carpenter i guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that also made the <UNK> 1986 <UNK> was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had <UNK> <UNK> this junk has the debut of daphne <UNK> who yeah that's right the <UNK> place chick her very memorable character dies about 15 min after the opening credits she's the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares the rest of the actors they don't deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting you're hoping they die a quick and painful death and not only their characters br br my humble opinion 0 10
<START> val kilmer love or <UNK> him sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go <UNK> this guy is a great actor ' he did in the leather pants of jim in the doors and he's done it again in the leather <UNK> of john br br revolving around the fall and fall of uber porn king john holmes kilmer <UNK> to his knees as we unravel one of the biggest murder mysteries hollywood has never solved for over twenty years with holmes the key suspect to a brutal <UNK> style slaughter br br what kilmer does so effortlessly is <UNK> the low life of the celebrity the do anything to anyone <UNK> that <UNK> anyone who had it and then lost it go see him you'll know what i mean
<START> an american woman her european husband and children return to her mother's home in watch on the <UNK> a 1943 film based on the play by <UNK> <UNK> and starring paul lukas whom i believe is repeating his stage role here bette davis <UNK> watson george <UNK> <UNK> fitzgerald and donald woods an anti fascist a worker in the underground movement many times injured and wanted by the nazis kurt <UNK> lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother in law but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the <UNK> <UNK> is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out br br great performances abound in this film written very much to put forth <UNK> <UNK> liberal point of view it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released as the <UNK> of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes the movie's big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over <UNK> bogart in casablanca <UNK> bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick but lukas is <UNK> as kurt the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut wrenching just to mention one scene br br though this isn't what one thinks of as a bette davis movie she gives a masterful performance here as <UNK> loyal and loving wife sara her acting <UNK> at the heart and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender br br the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions <UNK> <UNK> is not everyone's cup of tea but unlike the little <UNK> she has written some truly sympathetic wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers highly recommended
<START> i have found this movie available for <UNK> on netflix and thought i'd give it a try br br the plot revolves around ryan and theo taylor <UNK> <UNK> and david <UNK> who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away ryan and theo at first argue about who did what but later theo finds out that his brother ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a <UNK> illness so ryan and theo spend their time <UNK> up their differences br br this is such an incredible film i have only seen <UNK> <UNK> in season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this david <UNK> an actor i have never heard of before did a phenomenal job as well br br i would recommend this to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre this is one movie you don't want to miss br br i give this film 10 stars out of 10 excellent film
<START> this movie was so bad i couldn't sit through it without doing something else there was no plot and no point i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian i couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description politicians with no charisma speaking technical <UNK> could not be less entertaining br br so how was this made is there no quality control in film watching the girls in <UNK> was the only distraction during this horrible experience br br it's hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure he was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy
<START> the movie is an extra long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original <UNK> spirit the quite horribly american patrick <UNK> is cast as the british hero allan <UNK> despite the <UNK> of his <UNK> br br the movie continues throughout to hollywood <UNK> the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more <UNK> into the accepted mold the movie manages to be predictable throughout even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences br br all in all a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of king <UNK> mines and allan <UNK>
<START> this movie is great this movie is beautiful finally a movie that portrays <UNK> as people no stereotypes here this movie is driven by the story by the acting and above all by its theme that of cultural <UNK> and discovery they may seem like clichés but they are not at least not in this movie the <UNK> of the grand <UNK> of <UNK> is absolutely <UNK> and the audience is given a glimpse of a side of the <UNK> world that is rarely of ever shown in the west here the people are caring supportive <UNK> <UNK> and devoted to each other what a welcomed and way <UNK> departure from the usual negative portrayals of <UNK> outstanding movie
<START> a film so insecure the <UNK> perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title farewell my lovely thinking the <UNK> would assume it a remake the characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released time only adds to it its absurdity having none of the <UNK> cinematography desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several <UNK> within hours as if that weren't enough it threw in an utterly <UNK> attempt at <UNK> in which at least one of the participants hadn't bothered to <UNK> in several days this only made this mess all the more painful to watch find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure
<START> necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic <UNK> dick john barrymore is captain <UNK> who falls in love with the <UNK> daughter joan bennett his brother derek is a rival for ms <UNK> affections when mr barrymore loses his leg in a <UNK> accident bennett rejects him he must <UNK> the whale and win bennett back br br there are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences particularly the scenes involving barrymore losing his leg the film hasn't aged well however there are much better films from the time both 1920s <UNK> and 1930s <UNK> the two name <UNK> john barrymore and joan bennett aren't at their best br br <UNK> dick 8 14 30 lloyd bacon john barrymore joan bennett lloyd hughes
<START> along with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the same director one of the masterpieces of ex <UNK> comedies if you want to understand serbian mentality you must see this movie and if you want to see several of ex <UNK> great actors at the same time this is a opportunity
<START> <UNK> an italian movie starred by david <UNK> and linda blair i <UNK> expecting very much to be honest and in fact i took even less than i was expecting it <UNK> mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad now i only want to watch <UNK> 3 by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that
<START> the film gives a rather <UNK> version of what is contained in the book which as far as i can tell by doing some research and <UNK> fact checking is largely a work of fiction in reality there are no ancient <UNK> and if the author was hard pressed i'm sure he'd have to admit he's never laid eyes on any <UNK> in ancient <UNK> found in <UNK> these valuable <UNK> written as usual by anonymous were destroyed by the evil truth <UNK> in the church and in the local government that's rather strange as all kinds of new age crap comes out each year hundreds of books dozens of movies and the roman catholic church doesn't seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as i do a total <UNK> of <UNK> i'm no fan of the church mind you but at least the ancient <UNK> which they base their faith on are real br br it's a typical pattern of <UNK> artists and religious <UNK> to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by evil men or in joseph smith's case got taken back to heaven once translated therefore the actual <UNK> cannot be found in any <UNK> like the <UNK> nor the <UNK> checked by <UNK> in ancient languages like <UNK> or <UNK> it's a <UNK> in one sense i admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it but i couldn't do it myself as i've no desire to <UNK> the public with more new <UNK> <UNK> br br occasionally a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years the <UNK> of <UNK> a <UNK> text was discovered and after <UNK> dating and <UNK> study of the text deemed authentic by experts the <UNK> of <UNK> was <UNK> as <UNK> around 300 c e no church documents from that time mention any <UNK> <UNK> as authentic <UNK> or anything else br br we are <UNK> towards something that much is true but the optimism in the <UNK> prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies like a castle built on sand will collapse the harsh ugly <UNK> cruel world of blade runner is more likely what it'll be like over the horizon than some <UNK> hippie <UNK> where all is love and peace i tell people the truth and they hate me but tell them what they want to hear even if pure <UNK> and one can make millions the <UNK> prophecy is what the world wants to hear too bad it is a castle built on sand don't get me wrong i wish to god the <UNK> vision was reality only it's not no ancient philosophy at any time expressed ideas given in the insights with the modern concept of spiritual evolution going hand in hand with <UNK> evolution these new <UNK> ideas did not exist in the ancient world and did not exist until <UNK> evolution became well known that means the ideas in the <UNK> <UNK> cannot be older than the <UNK> c e and do not go back to the early b c e period or near the time of jesus of <UNK> this type of claim by new <UNK> is not at all unusual <UNK> claim their brand of magic and witchcraft the old religion goes back to the stone age when in reality no book of shadows has ever been known to exist prior to <UNK> <UNK> who lived in the <UNK> and was the buddy of <UNK> <UNK> br br new age <UNK> tell lies and claim their ideas are based on ancient <UNK> when the <UNK> would thumb their <UNK> at such <UNK> that are <UNK> by <UNK> today why do they do what they do <UNK> such fraud simple there are millions of dollars to be made and the modern guru <UNK> power over his or her followers they compete <UNK> and have a strong hatred for their competition despite their claims of love for all things each new age group bitter <UNK> the others it's a struggle for your minds and your <UNK> br br but learn one thing from me that is actually similar to one of the insights learn to follow your own instincts and look for <UNK> from within that i can agree with <UNK>
<START> i can hardly believe that this <UNK> turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works i've quite enjoyed the experience of enduring the lady and the duke and no other word but enduring will do left me in a vile mood a condition <UNK> only by reading the imdb user comment by ali <UNK> for not only has rohmer attempted with success to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century france but as ali has pointed out has shown at the cost of <UNK> his audience the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a <UNK> <UNK> woman of her times the director has accomplished something undeniably difficult but i question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so or for us to watch the dull results of his labor
<START> this movie probably had some potential for something my <UNK> is how these utterly <UNK> unfunny themes keep making it to theaters it's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are truly the <UNK> <UNK> behind most films are like dogs they return to <UNK> their own vomit well they're 19 bucks <UNK> now because of me this was not at all imaginative there was no redeeming moment anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer and nothing amusing was in the trailer performances were strained especially <UNK> totally unconvincing what was <UNK> supposed to be some comic relief was the <UNK> friend with a <UNK> for disney films none of his <UNK> hit home his little moral speeches were flat i was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful only to find out he was done the so called hard 10 is the most insipid plastic creature there is apart from having a horse like face with a weird smile i honestly found her friend patty referred to as the <UNK> to be much better looking than her but then again gentlemen prefer <UNK> well anyway the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it <UNK> all social <UNK> the way they showed this with a dude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the million times <UNK> and beaten to death horse <UNK> <UNK> routine with obvious <UNK> to american pie and happiness the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog i feel as if the movie was like <UNK> ridiculous jokes into an <UNK> wretched ball of raw <UNK> goes to show marketing can push anything out there shine whatever <UNK> mass and call it gold people will come worked for me done with <UNK>
<START> one of the very best three stooges shorts ever a spooky house full of evil guys and the <UNK> challenge the alert detective <UNK> best men <UNK> is in top form in the famous in the dark scene <UNK> <UNK> provides excellent support in his mr <UNK> role as the target of a murder plot before it's over <UNK> <UNK> little <UNK> is employed to great effect this 16 minute gem moves about as fast as any <UNK> short and packs twice the <UNK> highly recommended
<START> 2005 gave us the very decent gore porn flick hostel and 2006 gave us live feed a not so decent rip off of hostel live feed follows pretty much the same formula as eli <UNK> earlier film except this time the dumb kids are in asia rather than central europe the plot focuses on these dumb kids and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble the locals decide to lock them all in a theatre and kill them despite the fact that i'd heard some less than <UNK> things about this film before seeing it i still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director ryan nicholson previously made the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge film <UNK> but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring the film is obviously trying to <UNK> back to the good old days of <UNK> cinema which hostel did successfully but it really doesn't come off surprisingly considering <UNK> previous work in special effects not even the gore is impressive although it is a lot better than the acting there's not much else i can say about this film it's bad and not in a good way avoid it
<START> the devil dog <UNK> of hell is really good film it has good acting by the cast including richard crenna and r g armstrong the music is spooky and gives that <UNK> chill i liked the effects on the dog and i think the creature itself looked really cool with its <UNK> <UNK> like part on his neck and acted really <UNK> if you like horror films and haven't seen the devil dog <UNK> of hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i don't think you'll be disappointed
<START> what a disgrace i was checking this out hoping it would be an <UNK> james garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be the production quality was fine but the plot was undeniably lame and i can honestly say that i am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now the movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out it will give hallmark a bad name for those of you who insist on knowing what it was about it's about nothing and in this case it's not a good thing we are subjected to watching one old <UNK> woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to <UNK> the earth who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her she drags him through one mess after another gets him into one embarrassing situation after another and is proud of herself the whole time then the movie ends what a relief that was not worth the time it would take to watch it so do yourself a favor and skip this one you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is
<START> atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a solid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis
<START> how did mike hammer live in a <UNK> with a golf bag <UNK> in the corner next to a big screen <UNK> ray tube tv and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he'd knock back a bottle of <UNK> and twenty <UNK> <UNK> on the couch or floor of his fly <UNK> office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house <UNK> the <UNK> red <UNK> and oil <UNK> mud off his face that's how <UNK> wrote trash <UNK> for sure but how do you make it worse give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office add some over the hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw up the story line by some <UNK> drugged out screen writer that's how
<START> in case you're a self acclaimed <UNK> of cult cinema and or bad movie making there comes a certain point in life  preferably sooner than later  that you have to watch attack of the killer tomatoes it's an <UNK> <UNK> as this is one of the most <UNK> awful cult movies ever made one tiny but essential detail however is that attack of the killer tomatoes is deliberately awful right from the opening message already mocking alfred hitchcock's the birds this is clearly intended as a zero budgeted parody and i can't escape the impression that writer director john de <UNK> never expected for his film to become such a hit the film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so called <UNK> horror movies plants animals and nature in general revolting against humanity and introduces the least menacing type of <UNK> imaginable as <UNK> killing machines a secret government <UNK> project to produce bigger and <UNK> tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about <UNK> attacks coming from all over the country the president puts together a special forces team to battle the <UNK> enemy which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with <UNK> dubbed voices the first half hour of attack of the killer tomatoes is very entertaining as silly as it is the sight of normally shaped <UNK> jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical <UNK> is quite original and funny the first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song the jaws homage and the infamous <UNK> helicopter crash see the trivia section for more details that made it to the final cut after that however the whole thing turns into a tedious <UNK> and <UNK> amateurish mess the quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots personally i prefer the late 80's and early 90's sequels which i saw before seeing the original because they benefit from slightly better production values incredibly over the top <UNK> special effects and the presence of veteran actor john <UNK> the <UNK> family as the mad scientist dr <UNK> but as said before already the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life
<START> moonstruck is one of the best films ever i own that film on dvd the movie deals with a new york widow cher who falls in love with her <UNK> danny aiello angry brother nicholas cage who works at a <UNK> i'm glad cher won an oscar for that movie nicholas cage and danny aiello are great too the direction from norman <UNK> who directed <UNK> on the roof is fantastic moonstruck is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh a must see br br 10 10 stars
<START> i can't say i liked this movie very much it has some amusing moments but it doesn't seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a drama it doesn't really work as either it's too light in tone to be a drama and the amusing moments are few and far between it also doesn't make a lot of sense things seem to happen for no reason and it's also extremely convoluted i feel like they just made things up as they were going if they had just taken a bit of time to explain things this might have been a better movie i would say the ending was anti climatic but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to something which it didn't it just sorts ends and that's that i didn't find it boring really but like i said there there just isn't any point i'll give winter kills a reluctant and weak 3 10
<START> i first saw a track from this dvd at a <UNK> show <UNK> 2006 in london i was not really into cream until now it was through a high end <UNK> system it sounded great with <UNK> i had to get this dvd and i'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music dvd i have ever watched the performance of cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music dvd it does not matter what type of music you like this one will definitely grow on you it's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again even new musicians don't cut the <UNK> these days as these old <UNK> do
<START> i <UNK> out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites it was written by jay alan <UNK> and directed by vincent <UNK> it won two academy awards for best picture of 1951 and best screenplay the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big nina <UNK> is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel leslie caron his main dancing partner and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise famous french singer georges <UNK> sings too so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar <UNK> <UNK> piano fingers the songs of george <UNK> will live on forever in this colorful gem 8 10
<START> i'm not sure why this little film has been <UNK> into obscurity as despite some rather silly goings on the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money michael winner has admitted many times that he's not the best director of all time and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it's uninspired direction and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it the plot is rich with mystery and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat she finds that she can't afford most <UNK> she looks at but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully <UNK> apartment for an <UNK> price her problems start soon after moving in as she doesn't like her <UNK> very much and this problem <UNK> when the property <UNK> tells her that she has just one <UNK> an elderly blind priest on the top floor br br the cast list is truly superb with the relatively unknown <UNK> raines heading up a great support cast chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines but small parts for the likes of john carradine eli <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jeff goldblum and christopher walken to name but a handful more than make up for <UNK> lifeless portrayal michael winner does a good job with his central location as the block of <UNK> provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story the film is a little slow to start but it's never boring and michael <UNK> screenplay provides a surprise that's almost impossible to guess from the <UNK> which certainly deserves some praise like many similar slow burning horrors this one doesn't go for the money shot early on but unlike many the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer and if the <UNK> that he used actual human <UNK> is true i've got to say that he does a very good job at it overall while this film may be pure <UNK> <UNK> way you look at it the sentinel is one of the better films of its type and it's definitely a major highlight for its director
<START> i really wanted to love this show i truly honestly did br br for the first time gay viewers get their own version of the the bachelor with the help of his obligatory <UNK> <UNK> james a good looking well to do thirty something has the chance of love with 15 <UNK> or mates as they are referred to in the show the only problem is half of them are straight and james doesn't know this if james picks a gay one they get a trip to new zealand and if he picks a straight one straight guy gets 25 000 how can this not be fun take my hand lets <UNK> br br the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body the one you'd probably give two <UNK> towards at your local bar before <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> why they chose to cast james as the leading man is beyond me god knows there's so many other <UNK> and <UNK> homosexual men out there dying to be on tv br br aside from his rather average physical appearance james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of <UNK> even as such he has this arrogant <UNK> condescending aura about him however if james were standing up against a blank white wall he'd <UNK> right into in it i honestly can't recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show he is that boring and forgettable in fact one of the mates flat out advised him he wasn't feeling a connection i thought that was the best part of the show also james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying <UNK> sound feminine or sound <UNK> but don't ing <UNK> tones in the middle of sentences so painful to sit through i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking please choose a straight guy and <UNK> yourself and your unfortunate looking <UNK> br br then we have the <UNK> a remarkably bland bunch of men who don't seem to care either way what is happening equally vapid they seem to be <UNK> from one guy to the next except hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair again <UNK> inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles it would've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these <UNK> <UNK> however in all their <UNK> they still manage to <UNK> james which isn't all that hard to do anyway slightly that is you know you have a problem when some of the <UNK> are actually <UNK> and more interesting than the leading man and the fact that the <UNK> seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man very sad br br also i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true the straight men are all <UNK> than the gay guys br br don't get me wrong im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute it's just that overall they were just blah compared to the men you'd see on shows like a shot at love with <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> br br i don't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box i can accept the mundane <UNK> <UNK> but please for the love of god entertain me just a little no such luck br br if you're expecting drama intrigue <UNK> or excitement you will be severely disappointed the biggest drama comes from the fact that one of the <UNK> still may have a boyfriend in new york how <UNK> as <UNK> as that may be i guarantee you that is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show br br sure there is the twist but if you have any semblance of <UNK> in you you'll easily <UNK> who's who it wasn't hard at all i was only wrong once this show is <UNK> so much of its <UNK> on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else br br we get to watch as james co <UNK> along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance shopping for gifts visiting a <UNK> <UNK> and gay <UNK> yawn sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway that's one of main problems with the show no one seems to be enjoying themselves they are there just going through the motion trying <UNK> hard to appear to have a good time and you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame br br finally the physical aspect is not there there's no <UNK> no <UNK> no kissing no <UNK> of any sort it's just ok that was a boring date im gonna go back to my ugly tacky wanna be sydney <UNK> <UNK> quick peck on the lips <UNK> this show is so ing <UNK> it's ridiculous i can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived <UNK> nature of homosexual men but come the on people who watch reality tv shows are gonna want more than <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> kisses this show refuses to compromise br br sorry if this was long <UNK> but i felt these were issues that needed to be addressed i do <UNK> bravo for first putting up a show of this nature but the <UNK> incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind <UNK> to <UNK> my three points boring boring boring go do something else you'll have more fun waiting at a doctor's office for an <UNK> at least they have interesting magazines there
<START> i didn't expect a movie as good as in the line of fire or an episode of 24 but it looked like this movie was made for tv and did a mediocre job at best the good cast couldn't disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle they really try their best i think through their lines of bad script giving their rather flat characters any extras when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other better movies in it you had car chases big <UNK> romance plot twists etc etc this movie has none br br spoiler as soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to <UNK> character you know who's behind all this and all the hints you're being given you stand too close to the president see it from my perspective sound silly br br if it were up to me and maybe it's a good thing that it isn't i would rewrite the plot like this br br first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing <UNK> to cuba all the time
<START> i loved the curse of frankenstein so much that i rushed out to get frankenstein must be destroyed to see cushing at it again even if it was without <UNK> lee this time to my great disappointment this movie not only does without lee but it does without <UNK> monster altogether was it a case of if we can't get lee we won't have a monster at all why would they do that the monster is half the fun of the whole thing this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain <UNK> before ending up in an asylum i found the script extremely weak with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much i'm willing to suspend a fair amount but this movie got fairly ridiculous which took me out of the film rather than <UNK> me in it br br peter cushing though is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film for being one of the most beloved actors and <UNK> sweet men he sure could play menacing and <UNK> extremely well the supporting cast is competent but has little to do even the young doctor and his fiancée <UNK> into helping frankenstein a bumbling police chief is introduced along with his put upon sidekick to generate some comic relief then they are completely dropped from the movie why we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor and then it ends up being the victim of <UNK> brain transplant experiment there was no tension we weren't invested in the creature and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one <UNK> because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel br br also there are virtually no horror elements yes there is a <UNK> in the beginning off camera and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two men's <UNK> off again off camera and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene 90 of which is again off camera i understand that there is a love of letting the audience imagine it all for their <UNK> are far worse than what we can show but come on if you're not going to give us a monster then at least let us see the few horrific elements you do choose to include showing us a <UNK> in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary br br on top of a weak script i thought the directing was mostly flat there were a couple of nice shots but otherwise no excitement atmosphere or suspense was generated the same director did curse back in 1958 and i thought it was brilliantly directed guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was br br the movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for peter <UNK> powerful nuanced performance beyond that i found little in this movie worth <UNK> instead my suggestion is to watch the curse of frankenstein and see a truly great hammer horror film
<START> what can i say an excellent end to an excellent series it never quite got the exposure it deserved in asia but by far the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on <UNK> ever the end of a great era sorry to see you go
<START> these are <UNK> from a nine page <UNK> to mr <UNK> from mr welles written after orson had seen studio <UNK> harry <UNK> edited version of the picture he took an hour out br br the preview title music was written by a first rate composer george <UNK> although not written for our picture at all this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable the only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer <UNK> <UNK> is the rather weary one of using a popular song the theme in as many <UNK> as possible throughout we have musical references to please don't kiss me for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material the tune is pleasing it may do very well on the hit parade but lady from shanghai is not a musical comedy mr <UNK> is an <UNK> <UNK> of an old fashioned type of <UNK> now referred to in our business as disney in other words if somebody falls down he makes a falling down sound in the orchestra etc etc if the lab had <UNK> <UNK> and phone numbers all over the negative i couldn't be <UNK> about the results just before i left to go abroad i asked <UNK> <UNK> lawrence the editor to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi cab and also quite a bit of dialogue i am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence this was not done <UNK> for the main weaknesses of the film's opening reel there is nothing in the fact of <UNK> diving to warrant a big <UNK> <UNK> what does matter is <UNK> beauty the evil overtones suggested by <UNK> character and michael's <UNK> any or all of these items might have inspired the music instead the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some <UNK> moment in a silly <UNK> a <UNK> by <UNK> the <UNK> or a wild jump into space by donald duck there is no sound atmosphere on the boat a little wind and water is sorely missed there's no point in <UNK> a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen at the start of the <UNK> sequence in the temporary score we used a very curious sexy latin american strain this has been replaced with a corny dramatic sequel bad stock stuff this sort of music destroys that quality of <UNK> which is exactly what might have saved lady from shanghai from being just another <UNK> there is a big musical <UNK> after <UNK> line i want you to kill him this is absurd the <UNK> guitar music which comes out of the radio was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point as it stands now it's on about the same level as the rest of the <UNK> nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we're kidding the <UNK> scene needs more echo please don't kiss me is in again a bad dubbing job and poor <UNK> has destroyed the character of michael's run down the <UNK> from the <UNK> through to the phone call a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the <UNK> of much time and effort for some reason this has all been <UNK> in favor of a vague <UNK> as a result the whole sequence seems dull the audience should feel at this point along with michael that maybe they are going crazy the new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they're going to sleep the gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music the closing music again makes reference to please don't kiss me this finale is obvious to the point of <UNK> and does <UNK> injury to the finish of the picture br br all of these edits from orson were ignored
<START> this may have been based on historical events and we know that the makers of this tv <UNK> drama took liberties to make it more dramatic i can live with that but it was just so badly done i was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid air crisis how calm everyone seemed surely someone would have <UNK> and what a smooth flight no passenger <UNK> apparent come on not sure about the <UNK> nowadays some of the <UNK> security stuff seems <UNK> nonsense but why take your shoes off before the <UNK> landing common sense tells me this is not a good idea the shots of this massive <UNK> coming down on this remote <UNK> were unconvincing and fake in reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby in this movie it was out of <UNK> and looked like the model it probably was escape <UNK> appeared at the front and mid <UNK> doors yet nobody appeared to exit from the front even though the drop was much less the captain went back into the plane after the landing why this was never explained we know the <UNK> landing was due to being out of fuel but even so there must have been some fuel <UNK> around at the bottom of the tanks and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger yet the <UNK> seemed almost <UNK> and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape <UNK> instead of getting as far away as possible as i am sure i would have done there were just too many inconsistencies errors and <UNK> action in this i would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed it had the potential to be quite thrilling but <UNK> due to the budget <UNK> failed and made one feel that a plane losing all <UNK> was no big deal really and you would safely <UNK> down to a bit of a <UNK> landing but no real danger the reality of course being somewhat different
<START> bad acting bad writing this was a poorly written film it's too bad because it had some potential it's not even close to american pie or something about mary as previous comments might have you believe rent it at dollar night from you local video store if you're kind of bored
<START> this is a total waste of money the production is poor the special effects are terrible in my country they had the courage to put this film on video named as the mummy because of the success of brendan <UNK> s film i m sure that you can find better horror movies
<START> this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible br br there wasn't a continuous minute where there wasn't a fight with one monster or another there was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another i had no emotional <UNK> except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them br br scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies lotr star wars and matrix br br examples br br the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with <UNK> <UNK> one and vader br br the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like <UNK> being attacked by the spider in return of the kings <UNK> wood is the victim in both films and wait it <UNK> <UNK> its victim and <UNK> them up uh hello br br and the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrix or terminator br br there are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell me what was with the <UNK> <UNK> br br there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either br br just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money
<START> i went to a <UNK> of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was it was a combination of every horror thriller cliché trying to comment on many things including <UNK> satan worship undercover cops affairs religion and it was a mess the acting was pretty <UNK> the kid and the jesus dude were alright but apart from them anyways i admire the effort though slightly failed on the attempt at showing the christian people in a different way even though they did that the way it presented the <UNK> was a bit stock and <UNK> but then again it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid no actually i've decided it's just all around bad music oh my gosh horrible <UNK> over dramatic okay i felt bad for the people who made this movie at the <UNK> it seemed like a poor student project i'm going to stop <UNK> about this now and say bottom line go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap there you go
<START> as a former 2 time <UNK> karate world champion i like movies about sacrifice for sport but this movie is about so much more this movie is so good and so deep i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion almost lights out for me and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a <UNK> it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about this is a movie about living living your life for yourself and respect for others <UNK> god bless bend it like beckham i believe it is a true gem
<START> marlene <UNK> has established herself as one of the world's great directors this sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by <UNK> <UNK> and captures well that writer's dark irony john <UNK> gives what i consider to be his finest performance i am usually not a fan of his and emily watson is brilliant as well well worth seeing
<START> when a movie like the dukes of hazzard brings in over 75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society either we are <UNK> too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe i'm just not realizing how many people this kind of no effort trash will appeal to br br hollywood has had no <UNK> to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen this is that i walked out despite getting a free movie pass the dialogue could not be dumber the stunts could not be more over the top and outrageous perhaps this bigger that big image appeals to <UNK> but it didn't appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater none of the big names were in this career ending flick except for burt reynolds which says all you need to hear jessica simpson don't make me laugh br br i wouldn't even recommend this film for video even if you were desperate this was all about <UNK> the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing they did despite the public being <UNK> stupidity abound
<START> killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor you either love it or hate it i personally like it but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone the tomatoes aren't the same jokes are lame even the actors aren't as funny because that's the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be funny br br so now following the plot made to laugh is annoying they really shouldn't have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy
<START> as a huge fan of the original i avoided this film like the plague when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago but i just finished watching this film and found it to be a really pleasant surprise br br okay if you are looking for a <UNK> of the original you're in for a big disappointment but if you are looking for something quite different a bit edgy and political then this is the film for you br br gregory is now thirty four and works as a teacher at his old <UNK> school where he's being pursued by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams about one of his students when the student insists on meeting up with gregory a series of <UNK> ensue that include torture breaking and entering and all manner of unexpected twists and turns that left me feeling <UNK> and moved br br if you are looking for something original then i highly recommend this film i only wish that more people had gone to see this when it was released and seen it for what it really is
<START> this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old grainy vhs versions br br i hadn't seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time it's one of those rare perfect <UNK> of comedy where great writing truly funny line after truly funny line is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time br br dudley moore got an oscar nomination for arthur but lost although john gielgud won for best supporting actor if moore's performance in arthur doesn't win a best actor oscar it's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title another example is gene wilder in young frankenstein br br steve gordon <UNK> the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm hearted tone of the story quite simply imho the movie is a rare gem it's only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after arthur was released br br regarding the dvd that is available as of 1 2007 it's so so although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies there is still no widescreen version available br br the dvd has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included because they were hysterical but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit the dvd being the perfect format to include such material certainly should have offered it as well br br this the original arthur is a classic comedy that is one for the books
<START> this movie was the most out of line and <UNK> fed movie i have ever seen in my life besides <UNK> 9 11 all of the information was only supported on the opinion of five scientists while 80 of the <UNK> press highly criticize the science promoted be gore global warming is a mass media <UNK> and nothing more most of the information in the movie was either <UNK> or it was wrong all together this movie has been <UNK> over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies br br liberal <UNK> an to think that they show this in school proves that the media has <UNK> us into believing this garbage
<START> i haven't liked many tv shows post 1990 but that 70s show is great never seeing it during it's first run thinking a <UNK> period piece i was wrong i started watching in reruns and the more i watched the more i liked now it is the only show <UNK> post 1990 that i watch regularly br br although that 70s show <UNK> some of the styles attitudes music and tastes of the 70s it does not <UNK> itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s it contains so much funny witty biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and <UNK> by its main cast that it <UNK> any 70s clichés by just being humorous the humor is what keeps the show <UNK> watchable br br although a hilarious sitcom no matter what time period the <UNK> of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity but its the focus on universal issues family problems teen angst marital issues <UNK> pressure dealing with all of them with comic <UNK> that gives the show a mass appeal br br the show's center is one eric <UNK> played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar <UNK> grace eric is a super skinny geeky looking non athletic teen and still comes off as super cool due to <UNK> brilliant self <UNK> of the character eric has 5 friends donna hyde <UNK> jackie and <UNK> played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura <UNK> danny masterson <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> we get to see life in point place <UNK> through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see donna a forward thinking feminist is the object of <UNK> affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple most of the shows <UNK> end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful <UNK> which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity hyde is <UNK> best friend and soon moves in with the <UNK> when his mother <UNK> him hyde is the <UNK> <UNK> cool one of the group and just sits back <UNK> and makes fun of his fellow friends with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the dumb one of the group and <UNK> plays it the absolute <UNK> displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most <UNK> hilarious ideas and stories ever jackie who starts out as <UNK> girlfriend is a <UNK> self absorbed <UNK> <UNK> and is at first only accepted as part of the group b c of <UNK> but she manages to <UNK> herself to the point where they all have to accept her and finally <UNK> <UNK> is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country we never know exactly where and he is a scene <UNK> i said good day you son of a b <UNK> <UNK> is only sporting a foreign accent here as he hasn't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen his scene stealing moments often help make the show for me br br the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be the gang repeatedly gets into trouble most of it on purpose they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other they hang out most of the time in <UNK> basement plotting <UNK> or just plain playing around br br also <UNK> <UNK> in the show are <UNK> parents the menacing <UNK> hating red and the lovable happy go lucky kitty played <UNK> by <UNK> smith and debra jo <UNK> these 2 adults give the show a much needed mature point of view and constantly <UNK> and advise the 6 <UNK> do wells red and kitty are <UNK> supported by <UNK> parents the <UNK> bob played wonderfully for the full run by don stark and blonde bimbo <UNK> <UNK> the super sexy <UNK> roberts who was on the show for about half it's run additionally for 3 full seasons <UNK> sister from hell laurie played brilliantly by the <UNK> sexy farrah fawcett <UNK> lisa robin kelly was a major refreshing relief to counter the <UNK> of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents' sides kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 <UNK> but unfortunately kelly's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6 the <UNK> didn't last thankfully and was gone after a few season 6 <UNK> br br sadly at the end of season 7 <UNK> grace eric and early in season 8 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> left the show and it never <UNK> as season 8 turned out to be it's last grace and <UNK> returned for the series finale though giving the show a satisfying end br br a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor top notch supporting players were <UNK> high leo played to the <UNK> by tommy chong <UNK> dave roy the terrific comic jim <UNK> big <UNK> mitch earl etc they also got legends marion ross happy days and betty white the mary tyler moore show to play red and <UNK> mothers respectively many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well from shirley jones <UNK> family to pamela sue martin nancy drew to <UNK> to ted <UNK> to k i s s it goes on and on br br with great nostalgic 70s <UNK> and references hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical take no prisoners style of comedic storytelling that 70s show is a television classic
<START> master <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family in this film too we see <UNK> family members like pierre <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> dealing with serious themes like death religion suicide love and their overall <UNK> on our daily lives the <UNK> nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends they address each other using a <UNK> you in 1984 while making <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dealt with time memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence is love stronger than death it was 16 years ago in 1968 that <UNK> made a somewhat similar film je t'aime je t'aime which was also about love and memories message of this film is loud and clear true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is like a game which is not at all <UNK> it is a film in which the musical score is in perfect <UNK> with its images this is one of the reasons why this film can easily be <UNK>
<START> i have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind movies by will <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> especially as those are my favourites i picked this movie up on dvd as it was using the same idea as will <UNK> oh mr porter which is one of the finest comedies ever made i just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago the movie finished at 12 <UNK> i find that movies of this kind to do with ghost trains etc are best viewed at night time with the lights out that way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this movie br br the one liners in the movie may seem a little dated to some viewers i guess this depends on the viewer they are not dated to me though i am 28 and even though i am not old enough to have been around when this movie was first released my dad was though i still have a lot of appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind sitting in the room in front of the tv with some <UNK> and drinks and kicking back and relaxing at night while watching these movies not many things can beat the feeling you get while doing this it is an escape from reality for a while br br i noticed that one of the men in the movie he has a black mustache he appears about three quarters of the way through the movie after his car crashes and he is looking for a woman he was followed to the station this man was in the will <UNK> classic the ghost of st michaels as well just thought i'd point that out in case no one noticed br br the set pieces in the movie are very atmospheric outside the abandoned station looks good and as if there is not a soul for miles in any direction and the inside of the station is very <UNK> looking away from the rain storm that is outside i felt like i would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast the atmosphere in this movie is something that is missing from a lot of movies now it keeps you hooked from the moment the movie starts till it finishes br br we need more of this type of movie in todays market but sadly it could be over looked in favour of movies with nudity and swearing and crude humour this sort of movie making era the ghost train oh mr porter etc to me is the golden age of cinema
<START> i am at a distinct <UNK> here i have not seen the first two movies in this series although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films fans of the series seem to think this is a good film judging it on it's own it was pretty boring br br you never get a real good look at the maniac <UNK> robert <UNK> face but what i did see was pretty grim the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film not to give any thrills maybe if i saw the <UNK> 17 director's cut i may be more impressed br br the ending with the car chase with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and robert <UNK> was pretty intense best part of the movie
<START> with no <UNK> towards any type of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentaries i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of 20 dates i won't waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews i will say though that <UNK> hyper woody allen style narration was extremely annoying you either wished he'd lay off the coffee or <UNK> some <UNK> and it's potentially apparent to <UNK> himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it details his trials to <UNK> the documentary forgive me for <UNK> insults as <UNK> but i'll give credit to <UNK> for having the skills to convince some idiot to <UNK> this horrid piece of i appreciate the boundaries intentions of the film here but even when regarding the standards <UNK> sets for himself he fires off and misses on all levels in closing i'm sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a <UNK> wanna be filmmaker and therefore i question the film's sense of authenticity hey <UNK> i loved your film the first time i saw it when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith
<START> i should have known i was in trouble with casper van <UNK> as the lead character words cannot describe nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting terrible dialog corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force fed the beliefs and <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> network its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message attached to it they failed miserably it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time
<START> this film has a special place in my heart as when i caught it the first time i was teaching adult <UNK> it <UNK> very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time there are scenes which make you <UNK> with sudden emotion and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer <UNK> with the characters and their situation br br excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work a great turn by a young martha <UNK> an inspiring story line and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience
<START> the direction had clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is totally original however as to those who have read <UNK> <UNK> comic we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes br br another note is jay <UNK> himself do not know kung fu it just won't impress anyone if he tries to act like he can many people today can see the differences luckily the movie do not contain much of kung fu fighting and much are <UNK> by <UNK> and visual effects br br i think that <UNK> acting is still a pain to watch especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better the only reason i think why jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity br br despite how hard i wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this <UNK> movie getting what it shouldn't have it has became one of the best budget films in china for this year
<START> william <UNK> <UNK> to maniac proves <UNK> that without tom <UNK> spectacular effects and <UNK> convincing performance maniac would never have become the cult hit that it did vigilante is badly directed with a simple minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn and also mediocre performances by all the actors judging from the sense of <UNK> <UNK> this film gave me <UNK> had watched death wish several times too many before making this 1 2
<START> my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to <UNK> with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory however of the 10 pages of reviews only a handful are negative i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future br br i admit i'm more inspired to write reviews when i don't like a movie than as to when i do so my handful of reviews are all negative still that doesn't mean i'm biased towards not enjoying a movie but i often find more <UNK> reviews of movies i do enjoy br br paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie i've seen in years by using an intelligent concept and <UNK> some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories the movie ends up the worst of all worlds it is art for arts sake but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment directors can't write writers can't direct i'd like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated but that is because he's an actor turn director which rarely works either br br what ends up on the screen is a <UNK> mess of short stories that don't make any sense are not completed in 5 minutes and in total spoil paris to me why call it paris je t'aime when a more <UNK> title is <UNK> f <UNK> there are only a couple stories that are watchable most notably the piece by <UNK> <UNK> but everything else will fall into obscurity the <UNK> brothers short is passable but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar it's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it as we all love paris present company included we are <UNK> by the fact that this movie sucks in fact i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes seriously seriously br br people natalie portman is not a good actress she is is not a <UNK> dream girl waiting to be yours and maggie <UNK> why are you people acting or just <UNK> performances from other movies i'm looking at you natalie portman garden state closer <UNK> wood sin city and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> maria full of grace br br one final comment on the acting i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more <UNK> than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable br br writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right i'm thinking of <UNK> <UNK> raymond <UNK> f scott fitzgerald and john <UNK> just to name a few it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this the same can be said about short films it appears that only one director will live on in the <UNK> of history br br if you <UNK> paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own <UNK> with your own story then don't expect to enjoy this movie at all the directors either didn't care or were lazy in either scenario by the time you are reading this it means you rented it praise be that you didn't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it
<START> when the british film <UNK> asked martin <UNK> to create the american part of its century of the cinema series he grabbed the opportunity with both hands a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating wide ranging and as the title says a highly personal look at hollywood cinema br br <UNK> story is primarily about hollywood's directors  actors producers screenwriters and other <UNK> barely get a mention he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the director's vision and the <UNK> profit motive between art and commercial <UNK> he even opens with a clip from <UNK> <UNK> the bad and the beautiful one of the earliest films to openly explore this <UNK> this <UNK> the structure for the documentary <UNK> looks at how genres have <UNK> and clichés have become challenged how <UNK> have challenged the production code and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they <UNK> to be different however <UNK> never falls into the <UNK> trap of <UNK> directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses he <UNK> praise on cecil b de <UNK> or those who had less of a <UNK> style but were master <UNK> of the cinema nonetheless br br <UNK> doesn't necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either orson welles and alfred hitchcock two of <UNK> biggest influences are only mentioned in passing instead he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story for example he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved he looks at the work of <UNK> minnelli probably the most often <UNK> director of the documentary to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker <UNK> i can imagine that had this assignment not been limited to america <UNK> would have also loved to talk about for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell as it is he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as <UNK> <UNK> billy wilder and douglas sirk as well as the work of us born filmmakers that was produced elsewhere  such as that of stanley kubrick br br rather than simply tell the story of hollywood <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> films from various <UNK> in order to tackle various subjects in his section on the language and tools of cinema he begins with <UNK> griffith looks at the coming of sound colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which although <UNK> is not keen on them he is even handed enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them however he doesn't simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it instead he then <UNK> back to the 1940s to show how a low budget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the <UNK> and <UNK> of elements br br a personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope <UNK> has also restored the balance to forgotten or <UNK> pictures i was pleased to see that when he talks about kubrick in his <UNK> chapter he looks at <UNK> and barry <UNK> for me his two most underrated films <UNK> respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully rather than just giving us tiny bits and he <UNK> them with talking heads a combination of archive and new interviews only when necessary there is a bit of bias towards the 40s and 50s but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which <UNK> grew up and discovered cinema and after all i don't think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journey br br one word of warning though in its in depth look at certain pictures this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers
<START> god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i'm a huge fan of james cameron and not just since titanic i might add and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality then again he also wrote the <UNK> strange days but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of <UNK> that went nowhere on top of that i don't think the <UNK> <UNK> even those of any regular a team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie <UNK> and <UNK> makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude <UNK> pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron
<START> in its depiction of a miserable <UNK> <UNK> this film was probably quite revealing in its day however i get the feeling that <UNK> was never really director de <UNK> bag since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable <UNK> around a boy that had been found in a <UNK> <UNK> by an old dear in the country after spending most of his childhood in an <UNK> <UNK> ends up living in a <UNK> in <UNK> he <UNK> the inhabitants into community action and keeps their spirits up by <UNK> around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me as these people have far more important things to think about like where the next pot <UNK> is going to come from anyway de <UNK> then uses a <UNK> subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor <UNK> are where they are it's all down to capitalism of course and in order to illustrate this he has the <UNK> discover a <UNK> of oil on their land brilliant to his credit though by this time he has given up on making a serious film and the <UNK> appear as severe caricatures all fur <UNK> and <UNK> they want that land but our <UNK> hero will not support such nonsense by a bizarre stroke of luck his old deceased guardian from the <UNK> <UNK> days appears in the sky and gives him a magic <UNK> he uses it to shower gifts on his mates who prove just as greedy as the <UNK> men i <UNK> this film was a missed opportunity to address the theme of poverty as not many film makers had done until then and then get caught up in a fairy tale to me seems a bit <UNK> how come <UNK> directors get away with child like plot turns like the ones we see here hans christian anderson would probably have <UNK> at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the <UNK> <UNK> and on to a higher place on <UNK> de <UNK> however is <UNK> as a genius for this surely the fact that these people are so poor that their faith is <UNK> and that <UNK> never happen to them is enough for any story <UNK> to work on br br
<START> this movie was supposed to have depicted a <UNK> man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all however i did not care for his mission to settle down because i didn't care for his character i don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him he had absolutely no class or charisma he should've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his <UNK> playing but to no <UNK> just because he is a musician does not make him sexy not to mention the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous does this man have any shame what so ever had he <UNK> up and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character but alas his character was bland and boring br br gina <UNK> character was unnecessarily british she could've just as easily been an uptight out of <UNK> with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie br br the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog now those two had chemistry academy nominations for <UNK> <UNK> plot holes lack of character development horrible acting unnecessary drama cliché moments what a mess of a movie
<START> i can't decide whether this is one of my favourite movies it is a good thriller and has an emotional core but still i can't decide i definitely liked it this is the first movie of terry gilliam that i have seen my first impression i was engaged till the very end and it is not all that complex to be confusing br br the movie is set in the future a man james cole bruce willis is sent from the future in order to get some information from the past 1996 to be specific a virus killed 5 billion people he is sent from the future to get some information about it also involved here are a psychiatrist called kathryn <UNK> the love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life the loose ends are tied up in a very interesting manner at the end br br one thing i liked about this movie is that unlike other post apocalyptic movies the movie didn't prefer to give any boring social commentary and instead focused on this one guy and his longing for a regular life you want to see the ocean be with her is especially a poignant line in this movie it chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind therefore this is not exactly post apocalyptic movie but instead it could be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes that range from time travel to <UNK> realities and so on this is what makes this movie a special movie of the 1990's the complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters br br the performances are quite good bruce willis surprised me here as he didn't act the regular tough guy here but he gave a good performance of a confused man who is in love his desperation in certain sequences is portrayed beautifully i have to check out his other movies the gorgeous madeleine <UNK> is quite a treat to watch ever since i saw this movie i have become so obsessed with her she has given a great performance of a woman who <UNK> with her patient and finally falls in love with him brad pitt is the real surprise though with his portrayal of a crazy man named jeffrey <UNK> his oscar nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have kind words for him br br the end is quite chilling and that is also another reason to watch the movie the length or complexity is not as big a problem because this film is quite fast moving and there are enough incidents to keep people interested and every incident in this movie has a meaning and nothing is there that is unnecessary br br good thriller 10 10
<START> this was not a well done western you've got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a <UNK> with a <UNK> over it killing people for his own reasons you've got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a <UNK> cutting off pieces of his <UNK> which have been <UNK> then you've got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there what is the point of this film couldn't bruce dern find something better to do this was a waste of film
<START> this movie is so bad i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie br br do yourself a favour and don't watch it 1 10
<START> this is the kind of movie that's so extremely bad that you cant stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that <UNK> cannot continue to be this crappy all the way to the end it just <UNK> you know <UNK> than jaws <UNK> kind of bad br br i honestly think i've only seen one movie that was worse than this and then we're talking religious crap about how you'd end up in hell for lying or watching football br br gore indeed and lots of it well made gore no way br br the acting is beyond bad and all the lines are lousy clichés same goes for the storyline which only really consist of sex blood and violence like so many other gore movies br br if you're hoping for a mix between <UNK> the killer and august <UNK> keep looking you wont find it in live feed
<START> this movie has some beautiful sets and albert finney does a great job as the ruthless father the movie fails because jennifer jason leigh is too <UNK> as the daughter and is no match whatever for olivia de <UNK> far more nuanced mature rendering in the <UNK> 1949 the film's feminist <UNK> conclusion also goes against the <UNK> conclusion of the novel washington square whose author henry james <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in some of his other novels as a fan of old hollywood and great literature i found this movie very disappointing
<START> if you have sons or daughters who love action adventure intrigue and imagination without the need to break into song every twelve minutes then this is the disney movie for you my sons loved every minute of this film and i have to admit that i laughed out loud many times throughout the movie there are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story and the characters are all lovable and <UNK> in their own right this should go down as one of the disney classics because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non stop excitement
<START> seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable it <UNK> me to <UNK> oh my god more than once at the convoluted <UNK> of plot that were just plain silly br br <UNK> or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable near impossible human reactions and circumstances are too much to be <UNK> as to why they exist br br if you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one otherwise <UNK> some time into watching some paint dry for a more <UNK> investment of time br br that a film released in 2003 is already being shown on tv in july 2003 might give an indication of the film's quality
<START> i must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful an incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit man this movie was <UNK> with <UNK> of which if i mentioned them all i would be giving away the movie norm peterson aka george <UNK> must really be in a <UNK> to have agreed to do this movie the acting was <UNK> and the story was even worse as a sane minded and rational individual i could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie there was <UNK> on the part of every main character there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events then the movie ended one absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie it only makes a <UNK> train wreck
<START> when i first saw the cover of this movie a giant bug chasing a few <UNK> and the name blue monkey i knew i wasn't in for any big hollywood movie i was pleasantly surprised to see steve <UNK> in this cheese ball flick who always does a good job in whatever role he <UNK> the fx are pretty corny there isn't too much of a plot and i'm still not sure why this movie is called blue monkey because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey but come on people what did you expect it's not really as bad as it seems if you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movies this one is basically an updated version without the <UNK> special fx
<START> <UNK> is one of the best yet least well remembered comedies of the 1990's the film revolves around the various off camera <UNK> that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced daytime soap opera the first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic a list cast <UNK> features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era br br the film is superbly led by sally field as the neurotic <UNK> actress <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> throws a <UNK> when put in a costume that makes her look like gloria f <UNK> <UNK> her supporting cast reads like a who's who of 90's movie <UNK> whoopi goldberg robert downey jr <UNK> <UNK> kevin kline and kathy <UNK> all elevate the film greatly goldberg is predictably excellent whilst downey jr 's and <UNK> performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve br br in terms of writing the film is outstanding there is a really modern edge to the script which <UNK> into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions there also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time in some ways the film is reminiscent of mel brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of <UNK> <UNK> 1977 much of the film's humour <UNK> on it's often <UNK> but pretty accurate <UNK> of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors for example the extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by carrie fisher is both hilarious and honest br br <UNK> is for my money one of the very best comedies hollywood produced during the 1990's it's excellent script and a class cast make it a must see it's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes
<START> jackie chan's police story is a landmark film for both the <UNK> kong action genre and the career of jackie chan br br directed written by chan police story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre and like most of the the films of police <UNK> kind the script is nothing to be <UNK> about but the plot of the film is jackie chan who plays a nice guy cop struggling to convict the local gang lord br br the direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that jackie chan has given us that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece <UNK> however the job that jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable the standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes br br the performances in this film also <UNK> with jackie giving a very solid typical chan nice guy up against it role but this is by no means his best acting role that can been seen in the sammo hung directed film heart of the dragon the other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as jackie with <UNK> lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well but neither does she display full acting potential the standout acting comes from maggie cheung as <UNK> suffering girlfriend and bill <UNK> as the sympathetic and funny police chief none of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film br br the action in the film is what really <UNK> this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the <UNK> modern setting the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera to begin with there is a shootout in the <UNK> where <UNK> <UNK> is making a drug deal whilst being no john woo style sequence this serves as a nice <UNK> for the film this is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the <UNK> <UNK> everything in sight this is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by bad boys 2 in the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as jackie tries to transport <UNK> lin from her house to his this is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films this sequence is fantastically choreographed timed and <UNK> edited together to <UNK> the brutality of the scene however as tradition <UNK> the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film this sequence displays some of <UNK> best choreography stunts and camera editing work this sequence is now famous for two things the amount of people sent through high <UNK> glass which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people and the stunt at the end where jackie leaps from a <UNK> <UNK> balcony grabs hold of a pole and <UNK> down through a glass roof this has to be seen to be believed whilst the two for mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is <UNK> ability to <UNK> anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography that for me has never been <UNK> i also believe that the action in police story is some of the best filmed and edited action of <UNK> career helping to set the action apart from others br br overall police story despite its <UNK> storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding is one of the best action films of all time displaying <UNK> best choreography best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone <UNK> we watch a chan movie for the action
<START> bela lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses <UNK> to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife the midget in this film is hilarious a lot of freaks plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare i loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical hollywood fashion the story never gets interesting and you feel helpless as you watch br br usually i'd score bore flicks like this one low but the midget added just enough creepiness and <UNK> to gain a couple more points
<START> a response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was <UNK> one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to a <UNK> in the surrounding <UNK> this is simply not true prior to the construction of <UNK> 64 which <UNK> the ocean view area the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view once the <UNK> was completed ocean view rapidly became a ghost town with <UNK> closing up and an increase in crime this led to a huge <UNK> in <UNK> for the park which also faced new competition from nearby <UNK> gardens in <UNK> meanwhile in the past few years the city of <UNK> has done a remarkable job of <UNK> <UNK> so that the area has become a sought after location for construction of high end <UNK> br br it has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film <UNK> this is also untrue footage was shot of two coaster cars <UNK> off the ride for that film but the actual explosions and collapse are <UNK> to death of ocean view park br br as to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water <UNK> to the park was certainly silly but somewhat typical for b grade movies of the time with the cast involved there should be no surprise that the scenery was <UNK> in almost every scene by the primary actors i don't believe this film was intended to be another citizen kane i believe playboy was <UNK> with a new non nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into apparently not a strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the <UNK> table but proved <UNK> in execution the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the <UNK> ball anyway let's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise br br for the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film except for diana <UNK> fans but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park this movie is like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown <UNK> the first <UNK> and old <UNK> university even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome
<START> i have seen <UNK> beach a couple of times both on free to air tv in <UNK> i won't go into whether it is good bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this br br i will say that it is so australian only in australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born and to view it on free commercial television br br i have a friend from the us who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free tv compared to her home country sex and the city and <UNK> are just too examples br br despite our government trying to turn us into the <UNK> us state it is good to know at least some things remain truly aussie
<START> <UNK> based on actual historical events this <UNK> violent bloody and shocking period epic <UNK> viewer interest by creating a <UNK> missing in the majority of films set in a remote era ms <UNK> portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force her <UNK> transformation in character from an <UNK> if unwilling <UNK> in social <UNK> of her day is <UNK> <UNK> by telling sequences her witnessing of the hated local <UNK> casual rapist activity her forbidden love affair with a jew her criminal <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> forces of the sensual prince <UNK> anthony <UNK> there are some painfully realistic gory sequences human <UNK> in this film that are not for the <UNK> but viewers with strong <UNK> and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest deserves to be seen if only as an <UNK> to hollywood depictions of the medieval world
<START> personally while i'm able to appreciate really good movies i also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most <UNK> of crap you know those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie cutter action movie to kill time this is the only movie that i can remember actually <UNK> off in the middle and i have absolutely no intention of going back to finish it the plot was so contrived and predictable i was calling out what the next scene would be easily and i'm usually not very good at this the actors were horrible i've seen better acting in middle school plays even the scene cuts were bad the flow was all wrong br br this movie is like a parody that forgot the funny
<START> robert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> alicia <UNK> two stars are from city of the living dead i wonder what <UNK> is doing these days probably a lawyer or something like bela lugosi jr or david <UNK> there kid from dark shadows who wants to forget dark shadows existed anyway in the thorn <UNK> video there's no music over the opening credits but the music is great once it comes in with the italian movies the films aren't as good as the music my favorite scene is with the boy with the robot arm following loner alien through the desert alien says why are you following me tommy answers because i feel like it alien replies which way are you headed tommy says west then alien says well i'm going east so after a while of walking the theme playing in the background alien looks up and sees tommy sitting on a rock <UNK> a pet <UNK> tommy looks up and says to alien what took you so long i love this movie it touches my heart the boy with the robot arm needs a daddy and alien is <UNK> in to being <UNK> daddy in the desert oh yeah they need water too not the road warrior mad max 2 by any means but a silly western post <UNK> movie with a boy with a robot arm and alien and trash and a few other good guys with a mean chick with an iron claw and crazy bull who looks like <UNK> in the road warrior on sunday <UNK> on channel <UNK> philadelphia <UNK> after church i'd come home and find this on often too often love it 10 10
<START> i watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 <UNK> that's a <UNK> every 5 minutes seriously though this film is living proof that formula works if it ain't broke it don't need <UNK> a <UNK> yet vulnerable heroine a hardened ex cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with <UNK> pure magic

<START> superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit <UNK> and serbian mentality movie is a great comedy enjoyable interesting unpredictable best point in a film characters then humor itself story and dialogs humor has <UNK> <UNK> rare in serbian movies so it is consequence of characterization is well motivated spontaneous and <UNK> also it is sharp intelligent and <UNK> most of the movies unfortunately had constructed humor <UNK> a joke and put it into a <UNK> mouth or ordinary situation comedy <UNK> farce some of the <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> in this movie little masterpiece hardly <UNK>

<START> this movie was a horrible excuse for a movie first of all the casting could have been better <UNK> the main character looked nothing like her tv mom br br also the plot was <UNK> it was extremely cliché and predictable the ending was very disappointing and cheesy but thats all i'll say about that br br the nail in the bag though was a scene when <UNK> jordan <UNK> was supposed to be crying but the girl couldn't cry on command there were no tears <UNK> down her face just a few unbelievable <UNK> she is not a dynamic actress at all she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of <UNK> duff on <UNK> maguire <UNK> thats when the movie went from not so good to just plain bad it really looked like she was acting br br in a nutshell this movie was really bad it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990's that everyone's sick of only worse br br i give it an <UNK> because it was just so darn hard to sit through b t w i was <UNK> when i saw it br br however you may like it if your 9 or under
<START> without question the worst elvis film ever made the movie portrays all indians as drunk stupid and lazy watch <UNK> skin change color throughout the film
<START> it is hard to make an <UNK> judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age this is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film i was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth <UNK> never forget it i thought it was the most horrible movie ever made i then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified br br i am not a <UNK> or one to say what others should and should not see but i did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie i love <UNK> cinema but this is just plain nasty rent some <UNK> <UNK> instead
<START> if you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss first boy girlfriend or first puppy love <UNK> this film is for you ok so this movie would and will never win an oscar but as a <UNK> i loved it there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture the kids being raised by a grandma who's both mother and father the youngest son being <UNK> and <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> tin <UNK> <UNK> judy being <UNK> by the neighborhood men going to church and lighting a <UNK> candle the film's brilliance was in those small details granted it was not a pull out all the works cinematic <UNK> but it wasn't meant to be nor was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about latin culture tip make new friends instead more of a bitter sweet faux <UNK> this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously as in the tradition of y <UNK> mama <UNK> this was simply one boy's coming of age tale i recommend it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> o
<START> wow <UNK> well wow i guess i'll start with the plot a <UNK> woman lucy arrives at the family home of her would be husband <UNK> in france where they are awaiting the arrival of the bishop or <UNK> or someone in the catholic church to marry them to satisfy a will while waiting young lucy learns about a legend of a beast who <UNK> the grounds centuries before in bed that night she begins <UNK> about the beast and his rape turned <UNK> <UNK> with the former lady of the house that's where it gets interesting the plot is really pretty thin and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick but the filmmaker <UNK> those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale br br this movie isn't for everyone if you're looking for great cinema look elsewhere if you're looking for a far out movie about <UNK> that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject this movie is for you if you have a weak stomach don't be afraid of this one outside of some horse on horse action at the beginning the <UNK> are pretty cartoonish imo
<START> the entire movie is flashbacks from the first boogeyman movie as well as inexplicably footage from another <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> love film <UNK> it is framed with some more current from the early 90's anyway footage that is boring poorly acted and cheaply shot not only is the film almost completely flashbacks they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the film so you see the recycled footage over and over again as if you hadn't seen it already as if the originals weren't bad enough i've never seen a movie so padded someone was <UNK> the last dollar out of these films total ripoff and talk about padding why do i have to write 10 lines about this trash if i can convey that it's garbage in 2 lines that should be enough
<START> this is obviously aimed at the same market as monsters inc and shrek but is different in its less <UNK> feel despite the deliberately <UNK> characteristics of the lead creatures the story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end its more like its <UNK> at your shirt <UNK> but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different animals you know the outcome but you can't help being drawn in br br the characters themselves are far more than their voices the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices unlike most disney movies they are well rounded and completely believable strangely the group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think br br the animation is brilliant as you would expect and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie you will fall in love with the characters especially the comic relief of the <UNK> <UNK> and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts i came out wanting the obligatory <UNK> especially the <UNK> toy only to be disappointed the next day when i couldn't find anything vaguely related br br which strangely makes the movie all the more pure br br better than monsters inc or shrek
<START> i remember casper comic books but don't remember any cartoons maybe they weren't memorable i don't know but at my advanced age here i am watching this very early casper animated short yesterday afterward i was shocked to read the user comments here did people miss the ending br br i have to learn all over again that casper isn't like the other ghosts who like to go out each night and scare the c p out of everyone he sees no future in that according to the narrator here instead one night he goes out to the rural section of town inadvertently scares some animals and can't find any friends it brings him to tears until a little fox hears him <UNK> and befriends him the two become buddies but soon the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress br br other reviews have all mentioned what happens so i'll touch on that too the fox is killed by hunting dogs not shown and casper is in tears for losing the only friend i ever had but nobody mentions the happy ending to this story <UNK> the fox becomes a spirit figure like casper jumps on his lap <UNK> his face and the narrator comments they lived happily ever after both characters look <UNK> br br what is so sad about that this is a nice story with a nice happy ending
<START> very dull obvious tedious exorcist rip off featuring a <UNK> with red eyes that's the extent of the special effects in this made for tv <UNK> richard crenna is about as <UNK> as a chew toy very 70's dress music only add to the torture should put you to sleep almost as fast as the corpse <UNK> or the blue hand practically worthless <UNK> says <UNK> what a <UNK> dog <UNK>
<START> <UNK> by richard c <UNK> this disaster <UNK> up japanese theaters before coming to the states and going immediately to video where it was not seen again until the turner networks needed something other than <UNK> to fill their <UNK> <UNK> time <UNK> and found this tape at the bottom of their bin the <UNK> name is supposed to be used when the studio <UNK> the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it but i'm afraid that <UNK> can not blame the studio entirely on this one the actors mostly recent <UNK> of overacting 101 deliver one <UNK> line after another the plot is convoluted the special effects are unimpressive the parts that aren't laughable are just plain boring the script or the book must have been good why else would palance <UNK> boyle or heston agree to appear in this dud but something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen summary avoid not even bad enough to be so bad it's good
<START> why why did they make this movie if timothy <UNK> wasn't <UNK> in it several times there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie ever um plot nope well defined characters nope the only time i laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the whole she bang p s andy dick nope
<START> the godfather citizen kane star wars <UNK> none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of the sopranos each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute <UNK> completely and utterly three dimensional we care about tony soprano <UNK> despite the fact that in the <UNK> model of good vs evil he is evil soprano is the most provocative intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history if you're in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment watch the sopranos i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season 1 and not want to continue with the series each season is completely brilliant in its own way dvds are essential to <UNK> collection of out 4
<START> everything about this film is <UNK> wash pitiful acting awful dialog ugly native girls this movie sinks into oblivion the director must have been a weekend <UNK> robert c is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on the college kids are worst no acting talent at all very stupid reasoning and just down right <UNK> special effects are for the birds the so called security force around this park belongs in toy land with stupid looking guns <UNK> <UNK> that are useless and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper if the park is under construction and nothing works why bother <UNK> potential <UNK> until everything is complete the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew the whole film belongs in a <UNK> tank shot to another planet for viewing what a gem <UNK> should have to watch this so they can commit suicide
<START> got into this flick just as it was beginning on an afternoon where i was home with a touch of <UNK> otherwise i'd have missed it that probably would have been best br br i noticed the presence of lindsay <UNK> and jay thomas both very good performers and thought this might be worth a look it proved to be to some extent but only because it is one of those stories so awful it <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> has little to recommend her talents except for her <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> anderson like <UNK> unfortunately her acting <UNK> at least here makes <UNK> and anderson seem to be garbo or davis by comparison br br the young nut <UNK> white rat the <UNK> cat the young nut case having the owner <UNK> and restrained in her own home and a bunch of <UNK> including the young nut case running around a bio <UNK> facility and the absurd conclusion i kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element to contain at least a <UNK> of realism believability or being capable of <UNK> some empathy sympathy but this proved to be in vain
<START> my wife and i thought that with this cast and director the movie would have to be at least worth watching we were wrong in fact we gave up on it after 45 minutes the idea that crawford young and tone are british but speak with american accents was for me impossible to get past hard to believe this is england when no one talks with a british accent there is zero chemistry between crawford and anyone and to echo a previous comment the idea that cooper and crawford suddenly <UNK> their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous there is no reason to care about any of the characters which is why we threw in the <UNK> halfway through i found it hard to believe that <UNK> directed this as none of the actors spoke with the trademark <UNK> rat a <UNK> delivery so save your time and skip this one
<START> this is a very difficult movie and it's almost impossible to get a handle on what's going on at first it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a guy <UNK> who needs an apartment and rather <UNK> invites himself into one when the current tenant a woman commits suicide then the twists and turns start are the neighbors trying to kill him and why are the dead <UNK> clothes turning up in the apartment one wonders finally if <UNK> is the prior tenant br br spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler br br one of the tricks polanski pulls on us is to lie to us we assume when we see things from the point of view of a character that we see things as the character does and that there may be <UNK> of reality we assume when the camera is showing us things from its <UNK> point of view that we see <UNK> but polanski has the camera lie to us
<START> this film to me is a very good film br br i have a german shepherd myself and i wish to god he was like jerry lee i hope too that there is another k 9 in the running with jerry lee and <UNK> in them i don't care what any one say these two films were excellent
<START> a lot of talk has been made about psychological westerns but this is one of the very few that is truly in that genre it has big name stars who perform very well but it is the director who makes this such a good movie stewart granger loses his british <UNK> hunter stereotype to play a <UNK> retired buffalo hunter who is <UNK> in the west as one of the best robert taylor plays the <UNK> in contrast to the usual young <UNK> <UNK> character is middle aged too who wants to slaughter buffalo and <UNK> granger into business with him they hire two other big name actors lloyd nolan and russ <UNK> into being their <UNK> granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed knowing that he may be to blame if they become <UNK> knowing if they become <UNK> the native american way of life will greatly suffer taylor soon reveals a sadistic side but it is a realistic <UNK> unlike the one dimensional <UNK> of modern film created by <UNK> and <UNK> he is insecure and needs human <UNK> still he won't stop at murder the end <UNK> the two against each other with a startling conclusion the psychological effects of what they're doing are well depicted
<START> russ and valerie are having discussions about starting a family the couple live in a posh apartment and run an <UNK> business that deals with valuable <UNK> at the same time a dedicated <UNK> agency owner takes a mini vacation and leaves the <UNK> in the charge of his father leslie <UNK> father harry is in the rental business and he gets the brilliant idea to rent some of the children of the <UNK> to couples like russ and valerie harry who becomes aware of the <UNK> dilemma offers a family of siblings for a 10 day rental period brandon kyle and molly move into the apartment with their temporary parents with amusing consequences as the new <UNK> are inexperienced with kids but where is the possibility of a happy ending this is a darling family film the actors including <UNK> as the <UNK> dealer and christopher lloyd as the kind apartment <UNK> are all wonderful the script is snappy and fun and the overall production values quite high yes if only life could be this way <UNK> children everywhere deserve a chance to prove that they are lovable and can give so much joy to the parents who are considering <UNK> if you want to show a film to your family that is <UNK> in good values but is also highly entertaining find this movie it is guaranteed to have everyone laughing even as their hearts are melting
<START> terry gilliam traveled again to the future he had already done it in brazil to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race br br the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite entertaining and gilliam proves that he's got imagination the futuristic scenes are just great as for the cast bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine <UNK> whatever happened to her are just ok but brad pitt is so annoying whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all he should just play good looking successful young men br br my rate 7 10
<START> about 1986 i saw this movie by accident on tv one night i was 6 years old it was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to don't look now in 1987 i went to <UNK> on holiday the next year in silent terror hoping to god that my parents wouldn't find out i'd watched it br br would i have minded if my parents knew i'd watched les <UNK> when i was a kid i'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays and my <UNK> probably <UNK> in the <UNK> i don't know if they'd want to see it anyway from the stalking and <UNK> of a woman at the block of <UNK> in the first scene to <UNK> down the mountain roads with <UNK> <UNK> eyes i'm never sure whether this film is an <UNK> piece of trash that <UNK> the sexual revolution or if it's a sexy <UNK> movie to watch as it <UNK> on you that you could never be so offensive yourself br br it's definitely violent it has a violent view of sex virtually no <UNK> of love even <UNK> a young baby <UNK> into a greedy sexual act of exploitation but the scenario is very erotic and god i'm so british <UNK> do they suck her breasts for her own good that is exploitation so why am i getting a woody br br the <UNK> go in search of an experienced older woman find an ex con mother figure i don't know it ends in a truly gruesome suicide i described it to my friend <UNK> nelson who has cannibal holocaust guts and he went <UNK> no <UNK> love for this movie quite the opposite <UNK> of where the boys began why do they shoot the girl in the leg why does she come back to them do women need to be <UNK> so that they learn what is right from men br br i'm thinking of two movies one of which i wish i'd never seen the other makes me wish it wasn't such a harsh world swept away madonna what a pile of insanity doesn't <UNK> never been so offended that a woman <UNK> for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so <UNK> i cant use <UNK> once upon a time in america <UNK> god why does <UNK> do it destroys the path to joy we've been following him on his whole life so close to finally finding love with deborah now they are both destroyed why sergio why br br there is no rape in les <UNK> but lots of sex and <UNK> in abundance of both <UNK> very honest no <UNK> no fantasy <UNK> no perfect hollywood smooth moves jokes yes but there's too much darkness and jealousy and <UNK> in here to call it a sex comedy forget carry on shooting a naked <UNK> in the leg <UNK> she'll come back you'll hook her up with your ex con <UNK> <UNK> son she'll learn how to <UNK> from him br br two things i can't stand are rape movies and prison movies les <UNK> isn't a rape movie god <UNK> going to want to watch it now it is a brilliant movie
<START> this is a low budget roger corman horror creature flick a <UNK> is created when manipulation of <UNK> <UNK> runs amok an <UNK> croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping none of the characters have any depth but then they are not the <UNK> point we only get a few glimpses of the huge two <UNK> dinosaur <UNK> and some of the best kill scenes in a small budget film br br my favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three <UNK> dog for bait and becomes croc food himself nothing left on the <UNK> but <UNK> top feet with no real stand out roles jane <UNK> bruce <UNK> and charles <UNK> most pathetic is matt <UNK> and an obnoxious professional croc hunter <UNK> <UNK> i was most impressed with the <UNK> joanna <UNK> as the <UNK> feared dr p <UNK> is redeeming as a <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> since this picture is classified a pure entertainment work and since there are already many comments on it i'd like <UNK> to address something relevant to the abuse of humour we can see that marlon wayans is playing the joker role in this film certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job he has always been acting as a little man an actor can change his <UNK> dress but can hardly change his physical appearance and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary however far away from what i expected i saw an image very <UNK> pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty year old criminal and with a ridiculous happy ending so what is the point many elements are mixed up some principal ones are violence sex and criminal activities amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent lack common sense where is vanessa when the peace of her house is <UNK> and her husband's life being pursued in addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's no 1 <UNK> but the most sickening <UNK> is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points and they call it humour a diamond is precious hard and fragile it cannot be cut by any other material but only be <UNK> by the hot blood of a male goat hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of <UNK>
<START> this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs evil plot and is all about action what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around her movements were done so well why don't they use this <UNK> technique more these days it's quite effective br br fire and ice in it's <UNK> setting and <UNK> dressed women was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways her <UNK> body serving as pure <UNK> some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy others including plenty of women will adore it's <UNK> quality i for sure did not mind bakshi just loves <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> babes as can also be seen in cool world and i don't think he has to <UNK> since it's pretty much animation for adults but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it br br this one was just special so different from the standard disney or anime fare and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it's possibly bakshi's finest for those who like animations with <UNK> women try space adventure <UNK> as well br br i give fire and ice 8 out of 10
<START> to start with i have to point out the fact that you're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour yeah some things happen but you don't know why or what for when you finally figure things out you just realize that it's nothing but a twisted <UNK> opera dealing with mature prostitutes dead mothers <UNK> sons the characters are rather poor and the actors specially the young ones don't help that much to <UNK> look credible only marisa <UNK> stands out but she's a superb actress no matter if the movie is pure rubbish br br the only positive things to say about <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> is that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems to have good intentions and he's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense well maybe the next time br br my rate 4 10
<START> <UNK> 1988 was another early lou diamond phillips starring vehicle this film is similar to the later released film <UNK> there are a few differences but they're both the same i don't know which one came first i guess it'll remain one of the mysteries of life but they both are troubled kids who are trying to turn there lives around instead of <UNK> this one involves horses they're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell if you're a serious l d p fan then i recommend that you watch them both you get some extreme <UNK> and <UNK> from l d p if you're game then go for it br br not recommended except for l d p fans
<START> i could see this film is super he didn't surprise to <UNK> when so that it was taking place for the truth this way by itself how <UNK> flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only such an <UNK> theory right br br very i liked watching this film when i was the child i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense who at healthy senses sent to kids with space <UNK> into the <UNK> i very like reading for the subject american and soviet space programs i know a few missions of space <UNK> remained provided by cia with the <UNK> top secret certainly these are only such my <UNK> but who knows
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a bitter cynical journalist who <UNK> the unexplained he travels to this small town where it's said that a witch <UNK> ever is <UNK> the community br br his car <UNK> and he takes <UNK> in a small building and meets a beautiful mysterious girl suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her and the town is wondering who murdered this woman who i guess was the witch but i am not entirely sure <UNK> is now being pursued by her spirit or something and he has to have faith or something to beat it br br i really hate christian films they are usually filled with lame actors stupid storyline and minimal effects not to mention that this isn't just a christian film but a foreign one as well the voice over actor for <UNK> made the movie more comical than <UNK> because it is so high pitched and whiny you won't miss much by missing out on this film
<START> i didn't at all think of it this way but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title midnight cowboy was a gay porno at that point all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that seinfeld episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and <UNK> all sick and with a <UNK> br br the movie was great and surprisingly upbeat and not all <UNK> pretentious <UNK> like some movies i can't even remember because they're all crap br br the plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler a male prostitute basically thinking it'll be easy <UNK> only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up <UNK> him <UNK> him for their sexual encounter br br then he meets <UNK> <UNK> rizzo called ratso by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time you think of him as a <UNK> but a lovable one like han solo or <UNK> <UNK> and surprisingly he and joe become friends and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being <UNK> and such and such rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad <UNK> man who's very sick and very depressed and self conscious hates being called ratso and wants to go to florida where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved and he'll learn to be a cook and be famous there br br it's heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida along with many hilarious moments like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party and getting caught by the woman who says gee well you know it's free you don't have to steal it and he says well if it's free then i ain't <UNK> it and that classic moment completely <UNK> and <UNK> where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi and screams hey i'm <UNK> here i'm <UNK> here and the acting is so believable you'd never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman it's not the first time they've worked together in lead roles but the chemistry is so thick and intense br br then there's the sad part that i believe is quite an <UNK> to call it depressing ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie can barely walk barely eat <UNK> a lot is sick and reaches a head point on the bus on its way to florida he's hurting badly and only miles away from miami he finally dies on the bus the bus driver <UNK> everyone that <UNK> wrong and continues on sad but not in the kind of way <UNK> make you go home and cry and <UNK> around miserably as though you've just lost your dog of 13 years br br all in all great movie and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of everybody's <UNK> played all throughout the movie at appropriate times an odd move but a great one as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly go see it it's great go buy it
<START> i feel like i have some uber rare disease that no one has heard of and i have finally come across a support group on the net i finally found this title by asking for an answer on an experts site on the web i too saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending i have never forgotten it and have never seen it since no one i know saw the film and i had almost given up on ever finding it's title alas even knowing the name i shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find <UNK> small steps br br g
<START> i love sharks and mutants and explosions <UNK> with those <UNK> in mind hammerhead shark frenzy should have been the best movie ever br br it is not br br the monster looks like a villain from power rangers and has approximately the same range of <UNK> movement this might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be that is to say for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action scifi horror flick that could benefit from some mystery the shark gets a lot of screen time granted it is usually shaky and <UNK> i guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out br br the camera goes to a person about to get eaten the camera goes to the shark the camera goes back to the person about to get eaten only now they are screaming and <UNK> and so on br br the <UNK> is bad the acting is poor and the special effects are sub par but the writing is by far the worst things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten or so something can explode because let me tell you the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions more better mindset characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion they shoot <UNK> there is a massive explosion <UNK> rocks trees whatever they all explode so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end br br speaking of which i don't care how crazy a person is i find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half person half shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea that is unless that person is the mad scientist in this movie br br the bad thing is the movie is so random and at times boring that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest it might be a good one to mst3k with your friends but past that if you happen to catch this bad boy on do yourself a favor and change the channel
<START> another of many nearly forgotten movies <UNK> out by poverty row in the 1930's <UNK> by the magic of dvd br br starring stock universal player lionel <UNK> often a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies as a pair of twins involved in a murder <UNK> one kills the victims <UNK> involved in a <UNK> and asks witnesses for the exact time while the other is deaf and is proved innocent because he could not have spoken to witnesses br br of course where it falls apart is if it was a <UNK> <UNK> wouldn't they both be deaf oh well br br <UNK> does a pretty good job here <UNK> being deaf and mute unfortunately no one else here can really act worth a darn
<START> a year or so ago i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called <UNK> as it finished production and began playing at festivals two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater and just yesterday i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not <UNK> audiences in it's limited release with the exception of our local theater in fact here it is <UNK> all other shows at the paramount theater including 300 of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves <UNK> around in zombie make up and for any other locals who haven't seen fido yet but are considering it i can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize in fact they make the <UNK> valley look beautiful that's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie however fido itself is a very good movie yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market fido is best described as an episode of <UNK> in which the <UNK> has been replaced by a member of the undead this is a clever premise and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on <UNK> and playing up the cold war paranoia which led to <UNK> furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be <UNK> or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the dead br br <UNK> ray plays a small town boy who's mother carrie ann moss <UNK> for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block however his dad dylan baker is against the idea as he once had to kill his own <UNK> <UNK> eventually the family does <UNK> a zombie named <UNK> played by billy connolly and <UNK> to life with the undead billy connolly was inspired casting he is able to convey <UNK> confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes <UNK> body and <UNK> connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones this is his best role since mrs brown br br fido follows in the footsteps of other recent <UNK> such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon being someone who <UNK> bruce campbell and misty <UNK> movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones i prefer humor over gore in my horror however i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough <UNK> <UNK> in fido yet i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor br br the movie does break down in it's third act it's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of <UNK> zombies in the 1950s they forgot about the story arc however given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen i rate fido 9 out of 10
<START> i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night i didn't really hear much about it so i wasn't expecting anything but after i saw it i really liked it nicolas cage and the rest of the cast were very good but i do have to say <UNK> <UNK> acting <UNK> did need a little <UNK> up but such a small flaw it could be <UNK> br br gone in 60 seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life the movie is in no way predictable so the ending should be a <UNK> think it's just another fast car driving movie well you are partially right there is much more to it everyone should take a look at this movie
<START> yes it's another great magical <UNK> movie and i adore them all the characters the movies the tv show episodes it's the best comedy or musical tv show ever and all the artists behind it but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i'm surely talking about the weird ending br br i think it's very dangerous to involve that much in american drama and end a love affair by marriage we as all the poor viewers feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance <UNK> and misery so we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and <UNK> superman and lois lane dick tracy and tess etc so with all of the previous couples and their likes i bet that you feel safe <UNK> and peace therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done you'll be as mad as me br br they made the weak miserable creature <UNK> marry his daily nightmare the most <UNK> female ever miss <UNK> this is a historical change by the <UNK> of the american <UNK> industry and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage even the pathetic frog didn't have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious <UNK> only 25 millions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> millions earned by the first one the muppet movie  1979 five years earlier br br simply in this movie they took manhattan and my rest too
<START> a pretty obvious thriller by numbers in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing i was watching <UNK> for the english language performance by isabelle <UNK> it wasn't great but then it was a strange role i wouldn't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting room floor along with several last minute script re writes br br the acting is the least appealing thing about this film steve <UNK> looks like he's trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyone's told him he has there's a <UNK> stupid sequence in which it's suggested that his sexual <UNK> will be able to help treat <UNK> it's an uninteresting performance elizabeth <UNK> is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it's small <UNK> 3 10
<START> awful just awful my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from <UNK> like this they changed so much it is hardly <UNK> which <UNK> me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment it's like one of those lifetime movies that say based on a true story but are completely fictional there is none of the emotion or depth of the book just mindless melodrama if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading i suggest you try another version
<START> not having seen the film in the original theater release i was happily surprised when the dvd arrived since this film did not have the wide distribution it <UNK> br br denzel washington directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films about the same theme by more accomplished directors the film has a very professional look it shows that mr washington has learned a lot being on the other side of the camera he brings a different angle to this film br br one of the best things the film has is without a doubt the fine performance by derek luke he is an actor who with the right <UNK> will go far no doubt his take on the troubled young man at this point of his life in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life up to now has dealt him is very true his antwone is a fine portrait of a man in pain who is basically very good and has so much to give but no one seems to see that side of his character br br at the worst time of his despair antwone is sent to dr <UNK> played by mr washington in a very sober if somehow subdued manner because of the angst within antwone he misses the opportunity of opening himself to this man who wants to help but because of the <UNK> placed on his office just have three sessions and then has to dismiss his patient br br things work out as antwone is able to convince the doctor to keep on working with him <UNK> past is revealed in detail the abuse he suffers at the hands of mrs <UNK> his foster mother is brutal to say the least the attempt at the hand of an older woman in the <UNK> household of a sexual <UNK> gives antwone a bitter taste that stays with him throughout his adult life as he has been <UNK> by the shame he carries with him br br antwone finds love at last with <UNK> who is patient enough to make him see a different world by the love she and support she gives him br br the lead performances are very good indeed denzel <UNK> dr <UNK> has his own problems too he is not a happy <UNK> either he can help antwone but he cannot help himself or his relationship with an <UNK> wife br br the talent in the film is incredible joy <UNK> makes a fine <UNK> <UNK> nelson who is a fine actress is superb as mrs <UNK> the <UNK> foster mother br br the reunion of antwone with his unknown family is a bit too <UNK> and sentimental but of course if one is to believe that fisher finds happiness at last one has to accept that part of the film as well
<START> you know the people in the movie are in for it when king sized <UNK> fall from a clear blue sky in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer but he's too much the european <UNK> i gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams br br darkly original mystery heavy on the <UNK> from director writer peter <UNK> already he had proved his skill at <UNK> with other <UNK> in <UNK> at hanging rock 1975 here it's the <UNK> world of the australian <UNK> that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the <UNK> whites something strange is going on inside the <UNK> community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason <UNK> lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man's court but the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old <UNK> man gets in him and then <UNK> those scary dreams that come and go at odd times br br well structured screenplay <UNK> interest throughout one reason the movie works is the background <UNK> of <UNK> wife and little daughters audiences can readily identify with them and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual <UNK> the <UNK> begins to <UNK> and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to <UNK> chamberlain <UNK> throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does after all it's the picking up of the mask that holds the key i believe to the <UNK> yet his reaction doesn't really register the revelation br br of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain <UNK> now thirty years later in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining <UNK> <UNK> but the subject itself remains a telling one one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene a big white <UNK> <UNK> past an <UNK> family leaving them in the historical dust the <UNK> looks like an interior <UNK> <UNK> of no particular importance to the <UNK> <UNK> where industry <UNK> yet it's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave perhaps there's something about past and future to think about here br br anyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you
<START> i first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is still funny i don't know if you have to understand <UNK> in the 90's but it helps if you do in the 90's when <UNK> and public enemy were at the top there were internal <UNK> within the groups and members when their separated ways ice cube easy e etc also there were the wanna <UNK> accessible <UNK> that start making the scene vanilla ice freedom williams from c c music factory etc this movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it's an actually documentary <UNK> <UNK> plays an <UNK> that spends a year in the life of a <UNK> rap group name n w h the members of the group are ice code rusty <UNK> director tasty taste larry b scott revenge of the <UNK> and tone <UNK> mark christopher lawrence they are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial whats good about this film is that it is so <UNK> in its portrayal of the <UNK> industry of the 80s and they way it <UNK> fun at it but if you know 80's 90's rap you know how much of this stuff is true still on it's own without hip hop knowledge it is still a funny funny movie and for all of those who ask yes spinal tap came first but spinal tap is not the first spoof movie either this in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways better than spinal tap as spinal tap is to heavy metal fear of a black planet is to rap and the songs are off the hook also the dvd is <UNK> full of extras to include music videos of <UNK> as a group and as solo artists brilliant performances by rusty <UNK> and larry b scott
<START> sorry someone has to say it this really is was a dull movie worthy perhaps but dull nonetheless i nearly cried with boredom when watching it the acting is pretty dire the story drawn out and predictable the score and camera work totally standard and <UNK> it's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate <UNK> it is about disabled people but hate it i suspect nearly everyone does it is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie i suppose they too are not allowed to be objective this was made to win awards which i remember it <UNK> did but it was neither interesting nor entertaining i haven't seen the play so cannot compare
<START> this is only somewhat attractive for fans of bad movie entertainment it is more worthwhile for students of 1970's pop culture the fashions the furniture the attitudes and that great women's <UNK> moment of the early 1970's when it was still fresh and novel for a self employed independent woman to exist br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had a <UNK> rewarding if <UNK> career after all what is a flight attendant but a waitress at 30 000 feet that goes for the male ones too she slept around with multiple men could protect herself and others with karate and wasn't tied down to anything this is the kind of <UNK> woman that scared the <UNK> out of anti <UNK> those <UNK> idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband br br the sexy <UNK> was a potent <UNK> of the late 1960's to 1970's <UNK> even on the <UNK> family i remember swinging bachelor <UNK> <UNK> constantly <UNK> up with <UNK> and from that point of view this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of the pre aids free love women's <UNK> swinging seventies the plot is quite awful though and for those <UNK> in the audience there are few bare breasts to look at
<START> at first i thought that it was just about eddie murphy talking to some stupid animals i was right some people called this movie eddie murphy's comeback who are these people jesus if this is the best he can come up with he can just stay away what was the story again i was so annoyed by all the lame jokes i forgot i should have walked out on this one
<START> his first movie after longtime friend john <UNK> death <UNK> shows much <UNK> trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for belushi br br instead doctor detroit gives us <UNK> professor <UNK> <UNK> as a weird violent <UNK> to ward off a rival known only as mom that's bad enough but he also has classes to teach a school dinner to host four ladies of the evening to protect and a <UNK> dinner or something like that to attend no wonder <UNK> seems <UNK> most of the time why should the viewer be alone br br it was on this film that <UNK> met future wife donna dixon at least some good came out of this chaotic mess br br one and a half stars you want good <UNK> see the blues brothers you want bad see doctor detroit
<START> <UNK> visconti was light years ahead of his <UNK> the great directors of italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium but it was <UNK> visconti a man of vision who <UNK> to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing he clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with ossessione a film based on james <UNK> the <UNK> always ring twice which was later made by hollywood but that version <UNK> in comparison with what visconti achieved in the movie <UNK> visconti and his <UNK> on the screen included an uncredited <UNK> <UNK> a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings br br the film has been well <UNK> in the dvd format we watched recently the film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how <UNK> vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way something the american version lacked br br what comes across watching the movie is the intensity which the director got from his key players the magnificent clara <UNK> does an amazing job as giovanna the woman who has married an older man but when gino appears in her life all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life giovanna is one of the best creations in ms <UNK> achievements in the italian cinema the last sequence of the film shows ms <UNK> at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed br br equally excellent is <UNK> <UNK> one of the best actors of his generation who appears as gino the hunky man that <UNK> the obsessive passion in giovanna gino is the perfect man for giovanna something that mr <UNK> projects with such ease and sophistication not <UNK> before in the screen mr <UNK> makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent juan <UNK> is seen as <UNK> the older man who fell in love with giovanna in fact his character rings <UNK> than his counterpart in the american film where he is seen more as a <UNK> br br the film is beautifully photographed by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> they gave the film a <UNK> look that was the way italian directors of the era <UNK> the original musical score of <UNK> <UNK> is perfect visconti a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors also includes <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> that fit well in the context of the movie br br ossessione is a film to treasure because we see a great <UNK> visconti at the top of his form
<START> some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen and i understand where they're coming from but i really have seen worse br br that being said the movies that i can recall ie the ones i haven't <UNK> out that were worse than this were so bad that they physically <UNK> every sense that was involved with watching the movie the movies that are worse than war games 2 are the ones that make you want to <UNK> out your eyes or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness br br war games the dead code isn't that bad but it comes pretty close yes i was a fan of the original but no i wasn't expecting <UNK> from this one let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek appeal to it br br that's all i was hoping for something bad but that might have <UNK> at my geek strings was that too much to ask for is it really not possible to do better than the original war games even for a straight to video release well apparently that was too much to ask for stay away from this movie at first it's just bad like oh yeah this is bad but i'm kind of enjoying it maybe the end will be good like in the original and then it just gets worse and worse and by the end trust me you will wish you had not seen this movie
<START> denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie br br maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes that and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before br br so first it <UNK> you and then it puts you off the <UNK> pushes beyond suspension of <UNK> br br of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to <UNK> in viewers granted it does that so if you are looking for that knock yourself out
<START> let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci fi films of the 50s i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously the problem i have is that none of it works a parody should be funny and this one just isn't not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile in general i am easily entertained but i couldn't find a <UNK> of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures br br i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning the two stars make their screen appearance with one of the <UNK> gags imaginable a water <UNK> they can't control that gets them both wet these two come off as <UNK> boys <UNK> why anyone would want to <UNK> the act and persona of the <UNK> boys is beyond me after the less than <UNK> beginning the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences dancing indians <UNK> men <UNK> rings and other <UNK> unfunny bits it's all just a complete waste of time br br i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the <UNK> girls that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures
<START> i first saw this movie here in the u k in december 1989 when central tv broadcast it i still have the video tape although worn out over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been <UNK> by it br br anyway i remember coming home that night grabbing a christmas <UNK> switching the lights out and watching what was advertised as a <UNK> ghost <UNK> even now i remember certain scenes that still send the <UNK> on my neck standing on end br br i have seen some comments on the movie which say it's not this and not that i think those people get scared by friday 13th and the like stalk and slash <UNK> which are laughable this is a <UNK> ghost story there is no big budget action or special effects no swearing no blood no gratuitous sex scenes no <UNK> or guns etc so how refreshing it's atmospheric if you like chilling horror well written well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere this is the movie for you i like the original horrors only last night i saw the original haunting and that is a superb movie very atmospheric again and so is the woman in black the end of the movie <UNK> to the book but still very good i recommend it try it you will like it if you like traditional ghost stories so turn off the lights turn up the fire lock the doors grab a drink and enjoy
<START> <UNK> question of to be cool in the german cinema br br there are not many german films in the last ten years who have made me so interest yes the problem of the most german films are in this film <UNK> too he is on some places to <UNK> to be good to see special the figure of toni <UNK> <UNK> is too cool but thats is in german films always so everybody must to learns this <UNK> is the realism in this films thats difficult to understand but in this case it makes some sense because she steals and she lies she is the kind of girl is better you never love it because you lose it thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film she love her and she would lose her but nina lost everything she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling there is no way but you must take it said herbert <UNK> for twenty years thats so often the way it goes in german films why nina julia <UNK> is not inside of the laws of society the is outside and there she have no chance this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside thats one of the problems the stupid break with conventions the criminal fascination throw it all away and go nowhere but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting on the other side there the parents who are the <UNK> to the two girls the have a car a hotel <UNK> the have money and live in world with music of the opera but the film stand always in some distance to seem there is no much explaining of them br br in the center of this film there is one scene you will never forget the two girls got to a casting and there they should say how they find together in this scene toni will lying on she said a fantastic story has nothing to do with her and then nina will say the truth she said it in an <UNK> way there is no <UNK> in it she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here thats a great moment in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on than toni goes away br br okay the film will end in the german way of <UNK> rubbish here the circle of sadness is closing but there was a moment where is happening something else and this moment was important he is more than german <UNK> and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time
<START> so why does this show suck unfortunately that really is the only question because there is no doubt that it does br br for those unfamiliar with the premise of the show the doomed to be <UNK> series <UNK> focuses on a number of <UNK> and their struggle to exist in modern day america and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for <UNK> insurance the concept is solid and there is every reason to think it could be executed successfully br br i had to think about it for awhile but then the <UNK> from the commercials something to the effect of we're not that much different from you provided me with the key to the show's <UNK> even though <UNK> <UNK> are actually a different species than humanity the title characters of this show it turns out are exactly the same as those of us who are boring <UNK> br br maybe its my background as a game writer rather than a soulless hack <UNK> based writer from california but this show had so much potential and none of it has been realized to start with the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make <UNK> different from us br br what could <UNK> be funny for example about giving them <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> student and furniture store clerk when they would have more <UNK> been drawn to things like <UNK> <UNK> workers and <UNK> at cave parks why would they play <UNK> games like <UNK> when a whole episode could be devoted to them trying get hunting <UNK> to go after game with spears a show like this could write itself and it takes some <UNK> bad writing to make it quite so crappy and boring br br another tiresome aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the <UNK> as being subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human <UNK> yawn this has been done so many times before and never more <UNK> than this and as noted previously <UNK> really are a different species so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both <UNK> and off the mark br br <UNK> are welcome including those from anyone who wants to tell me why i'm wrong i'd like to enjoy this show and am just sorry that i have thus far been unable to br br michael j <UNK> <UNK> online <UNK> magazine

<START> i think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so i would just like to write about the impact this film had on me br br i first saw this film the year of it's release around 1987 my school <UNK> a trip to the cinema to see it for an re project i think we all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema little did we know what we were about to experience to this day i still remember the feelings it <UNK> in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends i think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly <UNK> in our own youthful way it had such an impact on me that i joined the anti apartheid movement the same year br br i think it served it's purpose in my case
<START> if your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time then this is the documentary for you <UNK> i didn't watch any more of this very disturbing piece of <UNK> but that was enough for me maybe the rest is even better br br i wonder how long it's going to take for television networks to start showing <UNK> movies perhaps game shows based on self <UNK> might be nice br br i already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen i don't need to see the proof on the tv <UNK> as entertainment

<START> this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good even though some of the actors and actresses weren't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old it was funny gross and just all out a very good movie in most parts i just didn't know what was going to happen next i was like i think this is going to happen wait i think this is going to happen all age groups will love this movie in some parts i couldn't stop laughing it was so funny but in some parts i was totally <UNK> out and i couldn't believe what i was seeing i am definitely going to see this movie again it is one of those movies where it can't get boring every time you see it is so suspenseful i definitely recommend seeing this movie
<START> imagine that i was about to miss this great cultural event on swedish tv last night and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the tv on to make it easier for her to fall asleep that i came across it yes i had seen an <UNK> for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an <UNK> <UNK> br br anyway this must surely be a rather unusual idea to base a film documentary on an interview made with sound only more than 30 years ago but with animated and other documentary film material it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the 20th <UNK> most appreciated literary artists georges <UNK> a k a <UNK> br br i for sure will read my <UNK> albums with a different eye after having seen this film which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in <UNK> life and i can tell you that i will a s a p get the few that i don't have of course my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years that i have already been reading them as has my view about what albums are my favourites but this adds at least one more dimension to them
<START> this film was pretty good i am not too big a fan of baseball but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love determination heart etc br br danny glover joseph gordon <UNK> brenda <UNK> christopher lloyd tony <UNK> and <UNK> davis jr are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport the plot was believable and i love the message william dear and the guys put together a great movie br br most sports films <UNK> around true stories or events and they often do not work well but this film hits a 10 on the <UNK> scale even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there br br 10 10
<START> stilted <UNK> strange and <UNK> if visually striking a wannabe erotic fantasy really boring way too much male nudity including father son incest and just a sort of shameless <UNK> i will confess however that certain <UNK> of dialogue taken on their own terms do have a <UNK> haunting quality
<START> the japanese <UNK> punk films have never really done a whole lot for me but of the handful that i've seen most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining <UNK> machine is no exception br br the storyline is about a species of <UNK> that take over human <UNK> takes control of their bodies turns them into <UNK> and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other apparently as a game for the enjoyment of said <UNK> the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other but whose love affair is cut short by both being infected with the <UNK> and are forced to fight each other it becomes a test of human will vs the <UNK> control over their physical bodies br br <UNK> machine will <UNK> be compared to <UNK> as most <UNK> punk films are and for good reason there are definitely some <UNK> parallels though the films are definitely different there's plenty of fun <UNK> moments in <UNK> machine and the creature <UNK> fx are definitely the high point a mixture of <UNK> meets <UNK> that are both elaborate and inventive depending on your taste for these types of films <UNK> machine may or may not be your thing if you enjoy hyper <UNK> <UNK> punk films with a healthy dose of splatter this one's for you 7 10
<START> i was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary and i waited a good while for this to come through the <UNK> my local video chain and it was worth the wait i like a good documentary special interest piece but this was definitely a heartfelt honest and nostalgic if you will look back on adolescent life the imagination of a child is fascinating and that's where a great story begins rent it or buy it if you like a good humorous and all around entertaining documentary mr <UNK> and company have definitely come a long way from neighborhood video camcorder productions of bank hold ups and gay rings that turn people gay from one glance they all seem rather successful in they're <UNK> fields and it was good to know that they are all still good friends the dvd has a few extra trailers for other good documentaries and it features a number of <UNK> most notable productions including crazy news
<START> prom night is a title only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred jamie lee curtis and leslie <UNK> this movie takes place in an <UNK> town where donna <UNK> snow is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years she and her friends arrive at the prom which is taking place in a grand hotel and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives little does anyone know a man from <UNK> past who has haunted her for years is also at the prom and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her br br i'm a fan of the original prom night so i tried to maintain a little hope in this movie but i have to admit i was quite disappointed prom night suffers from the worst <UNK> a horror movie could have and that is predictability there are absolutely no surprises here and i felt i had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times often better before what does this <UNK> to for the audience boredom unless of course you have never seen any horror movies or are part of the pre teen crowd but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen the plot is simplistic but the entire script is void of any type of surprise twist atmosphere or anything and this really really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into it all just seemed very bland br br a lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a pg 13 slasher movie as well and i understand what they are saying but i don't think it's impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore take carpenter's halloween for example little to no on screen violence but still an extremely frightening and effective movie you don't need gore to make a film scary but even had prom night been <UNK> violent which it is not it is very tame it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with the tension and suspense here is mild at best and i spent most of the movie <UNK> the outcome of situations and was correct about 99 of the time our characters aren't well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them and their by the numbers <UNK> are routine and <UNK> br br i will point out a few things i did like about this movie though because it wasn't completely useless the cinematography is really nice and everything was very well filmed and fairly stylish among the jump scares that are for the most part very predictable there were a few that were kind of clever the sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold however predictable the unfolding may be as for the acting it's mediocre at best <UNK> snow plays the lead <UNK> but really the rest of the cast doesn't show off much talent <UNK> <UNK> plays the villain and is probably the most experienced performer here but even he isn't that impressive however i did like the character he played which was a nice change from the typical <UNK> <UNK> type killer we see a lot as far as the ending goes the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my <UNK> end and it was very anti climactic br br overall prom night was a disappointment everything was very by the numbers routine and predictable which is somewhat <UNK> considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie there were a few neat moments but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere and had little plot development nor believable characters i'd advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it's out on video or rent the original instead because there are absolutely no surprises here some may find a little entertainment in it but it was far too predictable for my tastes i expected better and left the theater very disappointed 3 10
<START> a family moves into a old house in japan but there's a catch it's haunted boo <UNK> didn't mean to make you jump it's only a review settle back down <UNK> now anyways it's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife her lover in slow motion this naturally makes a 3 minutes scene stretch out to about 7 or 8 horrid acting horrid story but how bad can it be you ask well it was so bad my brain started to melt <UNK> out through my nose in thoughtful <UNK> it was so bad whenever doug <UNK> came on screen i <UNK> that i had flashbacks of small wonder yes i know doug was in out of this world not small wonder but it's pretty much the same damn show i can hum the small wonder theme better there are movies that are so bad they're good this isn't one of those br br where i saw it showtime beyond br br my grade f br br eye candy <UNK> <UNK> gets topless susan george gets 2 love scenes one nude one just topless br br
<START> no <UNK> <UNK> here because it doesn't deserve one not an art film not even one of those <UNK> gems you know like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good <UNK> and art films br br just pack it into the christmas boxes and <UNK> of quickly
<START> final justice has the great joe don baker running around texas shooting people who shoot people then he's off to <UNK> where he shoots more people he gets locked up many times for shooting people then he gets into a <UNK> with the bad guy who is dressed like a monk there is a boat chase and joe don winds up in jail again finally joe don with the help from <UNK> from seinfeld kill the bad guy blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a <UNK> all this and a catchy theme song just like mitchell
<START> this movie is a lot of fun what makes it great especially are two things one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes with discussions of their costumes and <UNK> there's an endearing <UNK> to the parody that's very appealing the second is basic <UNK> of the characters and the quality of the chemistry claire <UNK> deserves particular note as the object of mr <UNK> desires there's a <UNK> of talent here i realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed but this movie is a lot of fun and kind of sweet
<START> dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind but now he's fixed lane is his girl who's been messing around with his number one goldblum who's supposed to have something going with <UNK> sister <UNK> br br with what anyone could consider an all star supporting cast burt reynolds gabriel <UNK> kyle <UNK> and even an appearance by richard <UNK> can't help this plot as dreyfuss proves he's not fixed and tries to kill just about everyone in sight br br you know it's not like you didn't know what was coming the first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell goldblum what was in store for him when dreyfuss gets out but i'll save you all the trouble skip this movie br br the actual reason i picked this movie is because i've been on a diane lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies the real let down for me wasn't just the terrible plot but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie although we hear about her all through the movie even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film the parts where the suspense was supposed to <UNK> found me laughing at what was actually going on br br 3 out of 10 stars
<START> i found this film embarrassing to watch i felt like it was <UNK> the storyline down my throat as if i couldn't pick up the subtleties i needed a voice over to spell them all out for me constantly br br having a father who is still an alcoholic i didn't really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such <UNK> true <UNK> are very lonely people inside in my opinion of course they find it hard to communicate something that the main character had no problem with really except he did have a problem saying i love you at one point which was a bit of a feeble effort at establishing his cold character he was constantly surrounded with people too br br i felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil i couldn't connect with the character and felt no link at all considering my father i felt nothing at all when it had finished just relief it was over br br kevin <UNK> is an okay actor but not a tough guy feature lead the clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick <UNK> was too old for the teen they should have got three different characters or avoided the teen stage and concentrated more on the adult <UNK> br br on a good note i felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the film
<START> this movie was pretty bad sci fi is usually my favorite channel so i watch all the original movies that play on it i really don't know if this movie can be called original starting a <UNK> theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar what was it oh yeah jurassic park but this has <UNK> <UNK> instead br br the movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt one of them ends up <UNK> a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects i've seen the blood looked a lot like <UNK> also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many <UNK> tooth <UNK> as possible for people to enjoy 3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists or the people invited to the island to see the <UNK> first hand again sound like jurassic park probably the coolest thing was the <UNK> <UNK> tooth who <UNK> around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow <UNK> and goes through the guys neck funniest death i've seen on tv br br the acting is extremely cheesy the special effects are horrible the cg <UNK> could almost pass for clay models and even some of the sounds were off for instance when one of the college students is trying to escape he uses an <UNK> to break down a door the <UNK> goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound this movie was pretty bad the cheesy deaths were quite funny though
<START> in the tower of <UNK> installment of the mini series the narrator describes the <UNK> of the tower as the <UNK> of <UNK> br br that's like saying george washington lived many centuries before alexander the great br br or that the light <UNK> was invented before the wheel br br or that the guided missile was the <UNK> of the bow and arrow br br need i say more br br the writers of the greatest heroes of the bible should have at least paid closer attention to the <UNK> of biblical people and events
<START> being a fan of billy bob <UNK> and the diversity of his skills i noticed this movie listed and was surprised i hadn't heard of it br br i'd traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000 and when it hit theaters more than 2 1 2 years later that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production br br now patrick <UNK> can't act for sour <UNK> but <UNK> has more than enough ability to make up for the difference between them and <UNK> <UNK> is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see even if it showed her watching paint dry br br being curious i checked this <UNK> production info it made a <UNK> <UNK> per screen its opening weekend and just over 400 each after its <UNK> theater run in latter 2002 overall gross was <UNK> which i'd doubt could cover cast and <UNK> hotel and food for a week on location br br the story is pretty <UNK> and even the use of the usually interesting locale of reno is as dull as the rest of the goings on br br it's something like several snl bits all <UNK> together none <UNK> too great at all and the overall presentation even worse br br whatever the <UNK> for this production had to be considerable even if all worked for less than their usual <UNK> so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable <UNK> was the quality of the filming and billy <UNK> present albeit understandably somewhat <UNK> here compared with his usual work br br think of the three superb totally diverse characters he portrayed in <UNK> blade <UNK> and bad santa and you know he realized this work was below standard long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this one star for him even here and one because production was better than say the typical lifetime flick
<START> <UNK> harris plays the female <UNK> whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously only purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls miss harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no <UNK> queen if these are not some of the finest <UNK> ever displayed on celluloid i want someone to clue me in absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and i literally wore out my vhs copy capturing her charms i would like to know if this movie is available on dvd br br the rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention i was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent however i was disappointed on both counts god bless <UNK> harris
<START> the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom simply put the movie was spectacularly average it's not bad but it's really not very good the editing is good the film is well paced the direction is competent and assured the story is plodding the film is <UNK> acted by ledger bloom and the normally great <UNK> and rush the accents are <UNK> if you're from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery or as i like to call it orlando bloom by the end of the film i was neither bored nor moved some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie i have to say i so did not care by that point br br really the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range although the <UNK> present i'm pretty and confused look is prominent so <UNK> may find it worth the <UNK> price other than that just don't see it it's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining
<START> tobe hooper has made great movies so i was certain this couldn't be bad i didn't read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film at times this made me laugh sometimes i almost fell asleep sometimes made me almost cry for hooper br br i rated this 3 10 because its 1990 horror movie and many interesting or funny things happened there throughout the movie i was thinking something like they simply can't add more things in this movie but they did br br some tell this is some sort of <UNK> clone but truly isn't it's based on that idea but thats all this is combination of horror comedy weird religion god things funny gore simple effects drama horrible acting unbelievable script and more br br spoilers story is government tries to create ultimate weapon using nuclear power or something and fails during process child is born for 2 test persons when mom sings to her child after the birth both husband and wife burns and it is spontaneous <UNK> government <UNK> whole thing and leaves this child live amongst other people and then after x years this kid is grown up and realizes he has been born for a reason and <UNK> he can burn things with his brains then everything goes unbelievable messy nothing really explains anything and well when the government realizes okay now he can set this fire thing to work they take him to normal hospital where is some nuclear toxic what they are going to use on this man because they could kill him no they can't shoot him no and <UNK> i guess thats enough to tell i promise there is 100 more weird things in this movie br br well if you want good laughs watch this one gosh
<START> i am glad i saw this film having seen some of the director's other films in the past i thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge it was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handled br br i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes they were hard to follow at times br br ultimately a moral tale it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film it is a film i would like to see again br br some scenes like the ones where <UNK> and the prince were fighting on a psychic level were well done br br i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here intense
<START> i don't know who sue kramer the director of this film is but i have a strong suspicion that a she is a lesbian and b she somehow <UNK> everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not <UNK> br br i can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny pedestrian totally lame but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti gay or they don't get the gay lifestyle this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too anyway it's not even worth reviewing the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do it's full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing much less funny br br i hated it and i'm not afraid to say so too bad the <UNK> people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb weren't as <UNK> in their judgment
<START> i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie jack frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by a <UNK> entertainment and without exception everything this company deals with is pure crap first and this is very important never ever watch this movie sober why would you unlike many other <UNK> bad movies this one i feel was made intentionally bad i just can't get over how fake the snowman is which is why its always shown only briefly the way it moves is the best this movie is <UNK> better than the michael keaton piece of crap <UNK> that was made too be a good movie and that version is as bad as this
<START> thunderbirds 2004 br br director jonathan <UNK> br br starring bill paxton ben kingsley brady <UNK> br br <UNK> thunderbirds are go br br and so began thunderbirds a childhood favorite of mine when i heard that they were going to make a thunderbirds movie i was <UNK> i couldn't wait to see <UNK> 2 <UNK> in to save people while <UNK> 4 would dive deep into <UNK> get the idea i just couldn't wait then came august 2004 when the movie was finally released critics <UNK> it but i still wanted to go after all as long as the heart was in the same place that was all that <UNK> to me so i sat down in the theater the only teenager in a crowd of <UNK> else was over thirty and under ten quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that i have ever <UNK> br br the movie which is intended to be a prequel focuses on alan tracy brady <UNK> the youngest of the tracy family he spends his days wishing that he could be <UNK> people like the rest of his family but he's too young one day he finally gets his chance when the hood ben kingsley traps the rest of his family up on <UNK> 5 the space station this involves him having to <UNK> the <UNK> henchmen and rescue his family in time before the hood can steal all of the money from the bank of england br br trust me the plot sounds like a regular episode of thunderbirds when you read it on paper once it gets put on to <UNK> a mess we have on our hands first off the film was intended for children much like the original show was however <UNK> anderson treated us like adults and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for children's programming this on the other hand <UNK> down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the spy kids franchise the final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the thunderbirds series and children while missing both entirely lame jokes cartoonish sounds and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie and i'm sure that jonathan <UNK> is wishing he'd never directed this br br over all everyone gave a solid performance considering the script that they were all given ben kingsley was exceptional as the hood playing the part extremely well my only complaint about the characters is about the <UNK> henchmen who are reduced to <UNK> from old looney tunes cartoons bumbling about as amazingly enough the kids take them on with ease br br what's odd about this movie is that while i was watching the movie i had fun but once the lights went up i realized that the movie was fairly bad i was 8 lighter and two hours of my time were now gone a guilty pleasure perhaps nonetheless thunderbirds is a forgettable mess instead of a big go i'm going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie if the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it it would have been an incredible film worthy of the thunderbirds name however we get a movie that only die hard thunderbirds fans if you'd like to watch your childhood torn to pieces or the extremely bored should bother with br br my rating for thunderbirds is 1 <UNK> stars
<START> this programme bugs me there is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called fun it's just far too educational for my liking the characters are very stereotyped and unappealing the plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again where's the fun in it also i feel this has been on the bbc for far too long and is broadcast way too much does it really need to have a <UNK> on t v every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes i think it's time that the bbc starting bringing back some of their older shows like inspector gadget <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and count <UNK> other than continually giving <UNK> to these newer shows i thought the bbc where bring back danger mouse so what's going on with that 3 10
<START> when i caught a glimpse of the title i thought are we going to get another try hard hip slasher but actually i found <UNK> <UNK> to be a mildly passable and almost 80s <UNK> after a <UNK> slow mid section it picks up momentum for the final half hour leading to it's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending it won't win awards for originality because it's as <UNK> as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills usual cheap jump scares location secluded mansion and motivation from other films the <UNK> direction is by the book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script sometimes laughable but nonetheless i was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of <UNK> violence towards some rather <UNK> annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe the performances weren't bad in the shape of a <UNK> young cast however the characters they were portraying weren't particularly <UNK> an always <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shows up in a short supportive role as a <UNK> detective a <UNK> made but a shallow and forgettable addition to the <UNK>
<START> the dukes of hazzard will academy awards best actor and actress 4 the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie br br this movie was a torture to watch so sad how an weekly half hour entertainment was destroyed by these amateurs the only good thing about this crap was the car i remember when daisy was a real threat to look <UNK> 2 who's the moron that decided that jessica simpson is hot we know she can't act but come on in the tv show daisy was a fox and brunette br br all members who contributed in these waste of time please please please don't even think about <UNK> a sequel a prequel or anything that's got 2 do with a former tv show br br i gave a empty dvd so this movie could be burned 4 me i sat <UNK> it and i want my money back
<START> first off this movie was a wild ride the whole way the story of the training of the soldiers fighting with their superiors and in the end <UNK> together br br from the very beginning to the very end this is one war drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant <UNK> at times beyond reason and the horrors of what boot camp are br br the dynamics of how the actors <UNK> was quite amazing at times and sometimes humorous how <UNK> colin <UNK> deals with paxton matthew davis throughout the storyline from camp to <UNK> and even in the end helping him br br the innovative free hand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film constant moving constant action and just constant confusion at times it was a help others not so much br br throughout the film it was increasingly realistic some points in the film the sex scenes in particular seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that wouldn't have been there without them it was a very gritty movie through and through br br in my opinion this is one of colin <UNK> better movies if not his top performance the acting for every character was superb 9 10 <UNK>
<START> when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there getting there i found too predictable contrived and slow and to this day i still consider it as the olsen <UNK> worst however while when in rome isn't a terrible movie it's not a great one either if i had to sum it up in one word i would say passable it is good fun for teenagers but i think adults won't find much to go on br br when in rome does have its good points mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses certainly very pretty as well i will admit when i was 10 or so i really liked them and in general i kind of like them still and i have enjoyed some of their movies like <UNK> to paris and new york minute back on target both girls don't do that bad a job in fact they are very appealing plus their outfits are to die for and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking the soundtrack ain't half bad either br br however where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script the script is on the most part clichéd and has hints of <UNK> <UNK> the plot like most of the mary kate and ashley movies is very predictable and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen <UNK> work will find some rather unoriginal elements to it most of the characters are cardboard thin and you don't learn very much about them and sometimes the pace is uneven sadly the breathtaking scenery is <UNK> by rather <UNK> camera work that looked rushed constantly br br all in all does have its good points and certainly watchable however for my taste it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff 4 10 <UNK> cox
<START> i had nowhere to go i was on a flight to <UNK> i would probably have missed this film if i hadn't chosen air canada watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front i found this captivating and <UNK> i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to it's end now i'm looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i'll be quite as <UNK> when i can walk out the door is yet to be discovered br br the <UNK> composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and <UNK> <UNK> the story the photographs tell br br recommended if you have time on your hands
<START> when <UNK> a book to film it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts rather than ignoring the author altogether while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of <UNK> stewart's children it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good <UNK> <UNK> experiences of <UNK> her land the book details her life on her and her husband's <UNK> <UNK> in the vast <UNK> frontier she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and <UNK> though they lived dozens of miles apart the film however takes a standard stance for the time it was made portraying this woman's experience as harsh <UNK> and nearly pointless perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie as some film <UNK> have said but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and <UNK> it into a bleak <UNK> landscape devoid of friends or hope don't waste your time with this movie read the book instead
<START> sidney <UNK> the good earth has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting especially from luis <UNK> who won an oscar for her portrayal of o <UNK> <UNK> performance is so complete she is nearly <UNK> having very little dialogue throughout the entire film and it is a long one rainer relies instead on facial and body language she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such br br the film remains relevant today because it explores the <UNK> to <UNK> story and the universal themes that come with it when lung and wife o <UNK> finally achieve financial success after years of <UNK> and poverty they find a life full of <UNK> but lacking in meaning it is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a <UNK> of <UNK> the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch that they again find <UNK> a common formula told with the unique perspective of a chinese family especially for <UNK> makes the film a classic money isn't worth anything without friends and family a point that the film drives home perfectly in it's last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion
<START> granted i'm not the <UNK> <UNK> my partner is but a well put together clever flick is worth the time my <UNK> in brief br br dialog often weak and at times unbelievable coming from the given character br br unconvincing acting br br storyline never really caught fire br br the writers <UNK> choice bits from half a dozen mainstream films tossed into a <UNK> <UNK> not nearly enough and tried feeding us poor <UNK> the resulting mess <UNK> br br long and short while not absolutely terrible it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my netflix <UNK>
<START> <UNK> epic telling of one a america's greatest <UNK> efforts comes to dvd with some truly outstanding extras <UNK> young the <UNK> was added for the european release telling the story the great <UNK> leader who under inspiration brought members of the mormon faith church of jesus christ of latter day saints out to the salt lake valley in <UNK> after <UNK> murdered their prophet leader joseph smith played by vincent price was brought to the screen in 1940 just as america was about to enter world war ii it was a daring move on fox chief <UNK> f <UNK> and it was a breath of fresh air to the mormon people as this was the first film attempt to <UNK> show their faith on the screen now fox working with james <UNK> <UNK> of the excellent motion picture <UNK> at <UNK> young university in <UNK> <UNK> has brought this film to the dvd format in an <UNK> edition mr <UNK> who some years ago did his <UNK> <UNK> on the film has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a dvd he <UNK> the fact from the fiction and lets <UNK> understand why this films was so much appreciated by church leaders even though <UNK> to the truth run throughout the film one of the fun bits of information deals with dean jagger the actor who plays the title role many years after the film he married a latter saint woman and was eventually converted to the lds faith there is much to be learned from <UNK> knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the dvd there are over 100 pictures from the fox <UNK> <UNK> included on the disc plus <UNK> footage of the incredible premiere at seven theatres in salt lake city thanks fox for another outstanding dvd and thank you james <UNK> for your great commentary
<START> having just recently re viewed <UNK> for the first time in a few decades i backed it with descent even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine br br it's interesting to contrast how the unique <UNK> of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past <UNK> years from the full on gore of i spit on your grave to the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> to the <UNK> handling of the issue in the accused but descent though making some important points never really offers us anything truly new in terms of <UNK> meaning no descent is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it <UNK> from any significant message it could hope to make a message that when examined closely isn't that groundbreaking br br i pretty much knew the plot going in what i wanted to see was the descent or <UNK> of <UNK> character being a big fan of <UNK> i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted you know the kind of portrayal deniro brings to taxi driver unfortunately the script and the director writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition br br the biggest point of failure is the second act it became obvious what the <UNK> intentions were for this segment of club <UNK> drug use and obsession with big black <UNK> adrian every white boy's nightmare <UNK> from a q a on the dvd but this <UNK> into <UNK> character is never <UNK> rendered we don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time what she's after or why she's doing it the poor quality of the audio video again don't help but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well done first act by the time we get to the finale our interest has already <UNK> br br one point of success that dawson does point out in the q a is that by the end revenge scene we are <UNK> for <UNK> then realize just how drawn out and ugly the reality is while that's certainly valid it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing br br if you have the dvd check out the deleted <UNK> scene this is an excellent 8 minute plus <UNK> that <UNK> with energy and <UNK> though all verbal and really does show <UNK> slow crack up <UNK> as she delightfully <UNK> poor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> condescending <UNK> <UNK> if more <UNK> scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence br br as the film stands in the final cut though all we get is what we've seen before only in a more graphic rendering so what
<START> this might be the <UNK> 2nd best <UNK> of the year after <UNK> it was a good <UNK> john cena had an excellent match in which he upset chris <UNK> jeff hardy <UNK> his <UNK> title in a short sloppy match with <UNK> regal <UNK> spike dudley won a fairly violent tables match over benoit <UNK> jamie noble had a really good match with kidman which was <UNK> to me booker t defeated the big show in a no <UNK> match at one point booker t gave the <UNK> kick to big show and sent him right through the table in a stupid decision by the wwe christian and lance storm the jealous anti americans defeated hogan and edge with a lot of help from test and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> had the match of the night it was filled with great high spots and <UNK> got to retain his <UNK> title through a <UNK> so i was happy he kept the title triple h also signed with eric <UNK> and raw which means little to nothing and in the main event the rock became the first ever 7 time wwe world champion <UNK> both kurt angle undertaker in a triple threat match overall this is probably the <UNK> 2nd best <UNK> of 2002 7 10
<START> i didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this <UNK> of canadian history particularly the <UNK> done to the history of the <UNK> police in the <UNK> br br i'll leave it to pierre <UNK> noted <UNK> born and raised in dawson city <UNK> and author of the definitive history of the <UNK> gold rush <UNK> the last great gold rush <UNK> <UNK> to express my <UNK> with this silly movie br br the american idea of an <UNK> frontier subdued by individual heroes armed with six guns was continued in the far country another story about a cowboy from the american west <UNK> this time driving his herd of <UNK> cattle into gold country the picture is a nightmare of <UNK> <UNK> but the real <UNK> is the major <UNK> on which the plot turns  that there was only one <UNK> policeman in all of the canadian <UNK> at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the <UNK> when james stewart and walter brennan reach the <UNK> border with their cattle the customs shack is empty br br where is the <UNK> asks brennan br br up on the <UNK> river trouble with the <UNK> someone replies he's got a real tough job that <UNK> he <UNK> some ten or twenty thousand square miles sometimes he don't get home for two or three months at a time br br the historical truth is that the <UNK> territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen the <UNK> <UNK> police was <UNK> in the territory in considerable numbers long before the <UNK> strike they controlled every route into the <UNK> and they <UNK> no nonsense they <UNK> customs duties often over the <UNK> of the new <UNK> made <UNK> laws on the spot about river <UNK> and turned men back if they didn't have enough supplies or if they simply looked bad in true canadian fashion they laid down moral laws for the community in dawson the <UNK> day act was strictly observed it was a crime <UNK> by a fine to cut your wood on sunday and <UNK> young women were arrested for what the stern faced police called giving a <UNK> performance in the theatre generally nothing more than dancing <UNK> on the stage in overly revealing <UNK> br br in such a community a <UNK> was <UNK> one notorious bad man from <UNK> who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally <UNK> by a young <UNK> who had just <UNK> him from a saloon for the <UNK> crime of talking too <UNK> the bad man left like a <UNK> but <UNK> when the policeman upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over no man has yet taken a gun away from me said the american well i'm taking it the <UNK> said mildly and did so without further resistance so many <UNK> were <UNK> in dawson that they were <UNK> off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as <UNK> to keep on the <UNK> br br in <UNK> the big year of the <UNK> there wasn't a serious crime  let alone a murder  in dawson the contrast with <UNK> on the american side which was a <UNK> town run by <UNK> smith the denver confidence man was remarkable but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law which a <UNK> smith character from <UNK>  he is called gannon in the picture  can easily control in real life one of smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment <UNK> and was <UNK> right back again by a <UNK> police sergeant br br in the movie the lone <UNK> says yes i'm the law i represent the law in the <UNK> territory about fifty thousand square miles of it br br then why aren't there more of you br br because yesterday this was a wilderness we didn't expect you to pour in by the thousands now that you're here we'll protect you br br when br br <UNK> be a post established here in dawson early in may br br what happens between now and may you going to be here to keep order br br part of the time br br what about the rest of the time br br pick yourselves a good man swear him in have him act as <UNK> br br the movie <UNK> leaves and does not appear again in the picture his astonishing suggestion  that an american town <UNK> complete with tin star be <UNK> in by a group of <UNK> living under british <UNK>  is accepted naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the <UNK> he clearly fits the part but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot and he does others get shot even walter brennan gets shot stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own he <UNK> on the tin star and he and the bully gannon blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax br br to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north this bald re telling of the story passes rational belief br br <UNK> from hollywood's canada by pierre <UNK> 1975
<START> i can't believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie that's all i've got to say the movie speaks for itself
<START> this movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous i wanted to watch darkness falls actually and thought that this was the movie boy what a mistake i fast <UNK> as much as i could and still i couldn't get rid of the boring moments i just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie they were actually given money for this crap isn't that amazing i mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood <UNK> to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk <UNK> at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee please come on who gives money for such crap movies oh and the tooth fairy was lame not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored <UNK> wearing a badly made make up
<START> for years i remember reading about this show trouble with tracy in the tv guide <UNK> tv toronto every saturday morning at 6 am i lived about a two hour drive north of toronto and we couldn't get <UNK> but you know how it is we always want what we can't have br br well i knew what i wanted and what i wanted was to see what this trouble with tracy was all about did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role was there nudity was there suspense was it a comedy it would've been fine if there was some promotion of the show at least i could've known what i was missing but no the mystery drove me <UNK> until <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> built a re <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and began to broadcast trouble with tracy at the same time as <UNK> saturday <UNK> at 6 am one saturday morning i got up and turned the tv on at 5 <UNK> and at last i got to see what the trouble with tracy was yes the trouble with tracy was that it was canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was br br talented canadian actor steve <UNK> died a few years afterward but many would argue he effectively died the first time he appeared on this show when i saw it for the first time that cold saturday morning and fell <UNK> back into my bed part of me died too
<START> this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it isn't on any of her <UNK> the reason why is probably because it doesn't have a happy ending unlike all her other films its also not a musical although she does belt out one song <UNK> the world owes me a <UNK> the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white the version i have is in colour and on vhs i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic unlike i would say the <UNK> films of laurel and hardy which are dreadful the film is good for its age and the story hasn't dated at all i'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five although don't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it especially when jerry gary cooper steals a <UNK> and hides it in <UNK> teddy bear the tension and slow build up to his actions while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room is very well directed gary and <UNK> edgy facial expressions when they are put under <UNK> are also very good in all this is a good film from the early 30's accept it for its age
<START> i gave 1 to this film i can't understand how <UNK> <UNK> one of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous all the stories of the people involved in the movie are <UNK> boring and not interesting too long too boring the only things i save in this movie are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> hope that <UNK> will change <UNK> themes and style in his next film
<START> there's little to get excited about dan in real life first off the whole setup is incredibly contrived did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant marie wouldn't have told dan where she was going and since dan did all the talking during that conversation why would she be so attracted to him for that matter i never figured out why marie was so attracted to dan throughout the movie he's very <UNK> and does little to convince us that he's truly a good guy for example he lies to marie in the <UNK> <UNK> his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make marie jealous with a <UNK> <UNK> there's more <UNK> such as that ridiculous scene at the <UNK> alley where dan and marie are caught making out by the whole family yeah like that could really happen dan in real life is slow paced sappy and manipulative even chick flicks like the jane austen book club get higher marks than this predictable <UNK>
<START> this film speaks a universal language one can relate it to the self community society or the wider world it has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction <UNK> the portrayal of the stereotypes within the film <UNK> the <UNK> around us which must be <UNK> as being the repeating cycle of destruction the <UNK> force of <UNK> creativity and growth the factors which <UNK> the natural flow of things must be made apparent and <UNK> the idea is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it <UNK> into one's internal voice conscience through the looking it makes one feel as opposed to just watch
<START> knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting directing and acting and it's nice to see when a director script get it right <UNK> in at just <UNK> minutes 10 items or less doesn't stretch the story trying to grasp at inane topics it stays focused being funny sad and well thought out br br morgan freeman lucky number <UNK> stars as him an aging actor <UNK> at any roles presented to him we're introduced to him as he travels to a supermarket in an out of the way section of town by the kid <UNK> hill click realizing he has a star in his car the kid <UNK> him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years him isn't very <UNK> because not only has he been out of it for while he's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in i haven't decided if i'm going to accept the part the kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of <UNK> stuck him decides to check out the local market he immediately runs into the beautiful scarlet paz vega who <UNK> the 10 items or less register not just strikingly pretty but intelligent him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role he learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community br br but him doesn't just use scarlet he helps her so he can see deeper into her life they travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she's <UNK> for and how to dress for success even when confronted with target as the epitome of local clothing this is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of him too showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain store <UNK> world these shirts are only 12 bucks how is this possible the ending as stated at the beginning of this review is abrupt but <UNK> there's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond they know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other it's a quiet but riveting moment as <UNK> <UNK> car sits <UNK> outside <UNK> l a mansion br br this is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going and it won't waste your time either
<START> unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else i would've chosen it this movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance carol <UNK> albert finney tim <UNK> <UNK> peters edward <UNK> the innocence of newcomer <UNK> quinn and expert directing from seasoned pro john huston father of actress <UNK> huston is what made this film so charming even the 1999 remake with kathy bates victor <UNK> alan <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel before she did this movie all ashley johnson was known for was her role as little <UNK> <UNK> on the prime time show growing pains she had a few bit parts in movies but i don't know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own and adding joan collins as lady <UNK> <UNK> ridiculous they couldn't get good enough actors to play the major roles like daddy <UNK> miss <UNK> and annie but they will sign joan collins to play some british lady it doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was the critics were right to have not agreed with this movie even if it was only made for tv it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie
<START> i have to say <UNK> missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just <UNK> but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery br br <UNK> pfeiffer is <UNK> a mom who insists her daughter <UNK> <UNK> moss not attend a so called <UNK> party one <UNK> but <UNK> ignores her mother's wishes and takes off for the party anyway when <UNK> does not come home <UNK> knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance br br <UNK> missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this <UNK> original movie premiered last night 10 10
<START> this coming of age film deals with the experiences of two young girls dani and maureen as they learn about life and love one <UNK> summer br br directed by robert <UNK> famous for his superb work in to kill a <UNK> the film never hits a false note all the acting is superb as dani reese <UNK> makes a stunning film debut watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film i felt like i was looking through a window to reality rather than watching a movie br br i have watched this movie at least 5 times and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young being in love and going through the feelings challenges and changes of young <UNK> families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together and use it as a discussion piece as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry how to deal with being in love the <UNK> of a parent etc
<START> i had never thought the standard of <UNK> films would ever <UNK> to such an extent the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest br br saif has over acted kareena has improved her figure but is not a good actress anyway akshay is good anil is also good may i say the role wasn't good br br great deal of <UNK> is filled in wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie just because last few movies were <UNK> does that mean <UNK> films should make this kind of rubbish it has a history of so many good films br br overall i was totally disappointed with the movie
<START> this is a really great short from hal roach this is because of two main reasons the <UNK> kids in the short are among the <UNK> to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and well written elements br br as for the <UNK> of the little <UNK> i honestly can't think of a <UNK> kid than <UNK> at about age four despite being a rather <UNK> and unattractive kid in later years he was just precious here and placing the little tiny boy in charge of <UNK> the even younger kids was not only funny but once again high on the cute factor br br after the older kids blackmail <UNK> into doing this awful <UNK> job all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose the gags are pretty effective and well done for the time with an accidental <UNK> call involving a murder and a final scene where <UNK> finally gets control of the little ones being the most memorable i haven't seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave this one a chance
<START> while watching this movie i got sick i have been <UNK> up with <UNK> and every time was a real pleasure when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the <UNK> and had a real good laugh but this american version should be <UNK> and never be shown again it is terrible from beginning to it's end how can they manage to make it <UNK> bad well i guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha but they are never close to <UNK> may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast burn the movie and save the kids if you want to look at <UNK> then look at the original movie and have a good laugh we love <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sorry <UNK> <UNK> you will never stand up to be <UNK> oh yes when read the spoilers explanation <UNK> a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film well i guess the director stands for this you are looking at this movie at your own risk it is really a waste of time
<START> brothers with <UNK> powers yes really duel not just for debra <UNK> affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers br br there are surreal touches the fire <UNK> that act like a singing greek chorus but there is also humour wit and romance the soundtrack is great also and similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get but with fire and i don't think i'll ever forget dennis quaid <UNK> dennis quaid setting his own trailer a <UNK> too <UNK> a <UNK> priceless br br best line missing from the quotes section btw <UNK> you've had a clown you never go back ' br br i love this movie i just ordered the dvd from the us and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with <UNK> blond 3 don't put you off give it a try
<START> this review owes its existence entirely to a review we take a weekly tv magazine to see what is coming up and <UNK> decide what we will watch <UNK> there are brief reviews of most of the films <UNK> to be shown on the five major <UNK> channels in addition to the <UNK> each film is <UNK> a 1 5 star rating 5 means don't miss superior to 4 for excellent down to 1 standing for poor we have learned from vast experience that with few exceptions stars are awarded for gross taste foul language offensive content <UNK> horror blood guts and especially killing off the hero heroine just when everyone was about to live happily ever after if that isn't done the movie is <UNK> as being <UNK> the worst insult imaginable br br brave new girl was given only 1 star thereby suggesting it was a candidate worthy of our time and attention this was confirmed by the <UNK> description of the movie as being a truly awful tale and stupid just stupid we watched it and my wife and i were glad we did so the tv magazine reviewer further stated that the movie was not a <UNK> of war and peace with which we have to agree reading through the imdb reviews for this title a day or two later the urge to pick up my pen so to speak to add my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> emphasis on the first <UNK> for the <UNK> became overwhelming br br why did we take to this movie well it's just a matter of taste we like attractive characters believable relationships between them interesting situations courtesy and respect good <UNK> over evil and so on we liked the integrity and personalities of holly lindsey <UNK> her mum virginia madsen <UNK> barbara <UNK> grant nick roth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the two male <UNK> involved in the story so what if the storyline includes a <UNK> witch of the <UNK> in the form of angela barbara <UNK> provided that she plays the part with some conviction we appreciated the friendship depicted between the two room mates with one having a <UNK> challenged upbringing by a loving single mum and the other having every material advantage but receiving little <UNK> time and affection is it any wonder that <UNK> felt the way she did about <UNK> mum is it surprising that grant should take an immediate interest in holly considering the manner of their initial meeting <UNK> dazzling smiles and her lively self possession i think these issues and the events are believable enough but it is necessary to pretend that the <UNK> and other circumstances are realistic in order for the tale to have a setting br br my wife and i are greatly blessed by not having any significant musical education this <UNK> us to enjoy the sounds produced by <UNK> and voices without having our critical <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on our listening and thus spoiling the experience we enjoyed both the classical pieces and the pop which came over well on the tv and we weren't struck by any lack of talent also it <UNK> not that <UNK> classical <UNK> were dubbed by someone else br br we enjoyed the movie enough to look for a dvd the average delivered price we have paid per <UNK> for the movies in our collection currently stands at <UNK> <UNK> rounded to four <UNK> places brave new girl was available from a trusted <UNK> on the amazon <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> rounded to four <UNK> places above this figure such a purchase would increase the average why i should <UNK> this is a mystery to me but it is a <UNK> to our enjoyment of this film that we placed an order anyway i have awarded this film 7 imdb stars out of ten having <UNK> one for <UNK> reception of the performances by the audiences one for britney advertising and one for something else i can't remember right now in case it hasn't <UNK> this review is an <UNK> in celebration of the use of <UNK>
<START> hello boys and girls this isn't your regular movie review because this is going to be the cold hard truth are you serious this movie sucked so many balls i couldn't keep them out of my mouth they might as well have <UNK> me in the eye with monkey <UNK> you'd need one seriously large <UNK> to <UNK> out all the <UNK> fluid from this movie br br the plot was very lacking the actors were terrible i <UNK> the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was <UNK> on my own spit do boys everyone br br peace r h <UNK>
<START> proof why hollywood conventions are in place stale dialogue underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at <UNK> the magic of arthur penn 's bonnie and clyde 1967 and george roy hill 's butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar problems with <UNK> being self <UNK> result in the need for a <UNK> to explain problem sections the editing appears again to be an attempt to <UNK> the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor stills black white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can't transition well or to replace scenes that just didn't work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 br br overly dramatic pauses between sentences random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn't needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980's i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production the playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly <UNK> a weak musical score no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was <UNK> doors footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late 60's through the mid 70's by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire <UNK> on dirt roads in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no <UNK> characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story neither the gangsters nor the <UNK> were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the <UNK> a necessity for any story to work for me we know from <UNK> and <UNK> movies who the <UNK> are even though they are criminals we like them and want to see them get away i could care less who was on the screen in this film i got the impression that john <UNK> was trying to give off a non historically accurate <UNK> documentary of the events surrounding john <UNK> life from june 1933 to july 1934 his death br br to be fair there are some moments of good solid storytelling which are moments that shine forth <UNK> from the dark and dismal <UNK> in which this film sits john <UNK> gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn't seem to try to <UNK> other filmmakers dillinger 1973 isn't a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the <UNK> of breaking out are involved with this directorial <UNK> <UNK> debut but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy br br
<START> and being let down bigger than ever before i won't make any direct references or anything here but to say the least this film is pathetic if you're military trained don't bother watching i put it on the dvd with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action war flick why couldn't i just have read the reviews first br br already at the first bomb scene the film has huge <UNK> and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger my 2 friends not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the <UNK> mistakes almost as fast as i myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic well as you might have guessed they're not at all br br avoid this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re occurring mistakes being made 2 10 for catching my interest at first
<START> joel <UNK> directs the script he co wrote and has a group of <UNK> <UNK> confronted with adult life situations the story line is a <UNK> mess but some scenes are actually good there is a lot of wasted talent and time here the cast is more impressive than the movie featured are <UNK> moore rob lowe judd nelson andrew mccarthy <UNK> <UNK> ally <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the most notable being mccarthy and moore lowe is quite obnoxious coming of age is not so damn easy
<START> one of the greatest westerns of all time but this one unlike many others does not deal with the nature horses <UNK> etc but instead deals with one rifle the winchester '73 and how this one rifle effects others and how they effect it a rifle is not a living breathing human being right you may be inclined to believe that it is not but it seems to have a mind of its own for two very similar reasons it gets back to its <UNK> owner in the end even though that throughout the rest of the picture its <UNK> owners do their best to make sure it does not and it never seems to be content until it gets back to its original owner so <UNK> the <UNK> owners always seem to lose it somehow or get killed trying to protect and keep it until it gets back to james stewart then it is content but not every one of the owners deserves to have it stewart does of course since he won it <UNK> does not since he had to be a dirty thief and steal it drake definitely does not because he would probably lose it in some poker game and besides drake is too cowardly to fight so why should he have a one of a kind rifle if he will not even use it duryea does not because he is just a <UNK> maniac and we all know that <UNK> <UNK> do not deserve guns this film has a sort of noir edge that only westerns can have such as the <UNK> bow incident westerns have their own type of noir much different than the 30's and 40's bogart films it is hands down the best one out of all five stewart mann westerns even though my personal favorite is bend of the river the other four became much different than this one i do not think it a coincidence to see that the other four were color and this is black and white this is because of the noir edge all five films had the revenge and the dark past on stewart's part play into the film to the point where this is not just stewart's dark side but also actually a sort of character not one to be listed in the credits but one that you can only recognize and know that it is there always present however this one not just on revenge and the dark past but also in terms of supreme danger and characters that were very different than stewart make it <UNK> the other four in all aspects but stewart never crosses the line he does however walk the line between light and dark this is why black and white played such an integral part in the film they could have all been black and white or they could have all been color but this one is in black and white and the other four are in color and there is a very good reason for that
<START> so we <UNK> this was a fairly charming film i liked the art direction it felt far more real than most kids movies and the costumes weren't too <UNK> the child actors were not bad to watch the adult performances <UNK> toward cheesy it was great that they showed how a <UNK> kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying br br i don't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves but it's a great film to take a kid to and since <UNK> was apparently attended by 100 kids at the same time i'm really glad we picked the <UNK> attended showing of worms instead
<START> why do i constantly do this to myself i mean really it's right there in the title the incredible melting man what else would i expect i have to admit i'm a sucker for just about anything i come across on the monster <UNK> channel but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary rick baker as for creepy i'll give the nod to that horny old <UNK> couple sucking on <UNK> just before lights out now they were truly scary br br something i could never figure out in horror flicks was why a <UNK> victims wouldn't simply just run away when faced with virtual <UNK> like the chick in the cabin you know there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time incredible steve o couldn't <UNK> much more than a <UNK> walk so why not just blow right by him i don't know maybe i'm missing something br br this flick had some of the feel of a <UNK> from the <UNK> episode but <UNK> usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you didn't see coming this was one picture that you couldn't quite get a handle on coming or going for example in an early scene you can clearly make out that melting man's <UNK> fell out of his head so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story i guess we're not supposed to ask br br at <UNK> four minutes this picture was about an hour and a half too long when it was all over i was ready to take up general perry on his earlier suggestion i could really use a drink about now
<START> this is not a good movie but i still like it the cat <UNK> is gold in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves <UNK> opposed to the evil <UNK> i think there is more to this movie than people realize basically it is very harsh but this <UNK> can sometimes be good it's got the corny lines the abrupt ending and a comedic element conveyed by the bumbling policemen br br did anyone find the incestuous element a bit disturbing ultimately this movie is casually and randomly <UNK> which is quite effective i <UNK> it to psycho the relationship between the mother and son the changing of protagonists i think the <UNK> works also this is not a movie that you want them to <UNK> it only works if it's short br br i'm still not sure whether the director lacked depth or whether he did these things with purpose we know stephen king has ability yet i haven't even read his books only seen some of his movies br br anyway i liked it if you like harsh corny movies with 80's overtones just watch it but don't expect too much it really is so bad its good
<START> this series just gets worse and worse poorly written and just plain not funny the premise is excellent but the writer's <UNK> shines through by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about and <UNK> to that <UNK> smug oh silly you style acting that comes with a no laugh script they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say aren't we zany isn't this funny well no it's not actually <UNK> disease is less painful no wonder with the exception of corner gas <UNK> generally avoid canadian tv come on cbc you're suppose to be our leading station <UNK> the best of canadian talent pull the plug on this amateurish mess
<START> its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these <UNK> <UNK> movies they are so unbelievably formulaic and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier i'm sure they would have been <UNK> this film too that's if they found any actual original material to <UNK> it from the screams i know what you did last <UNK> and urban legends br br valentine offers nothing new to this genre except a better than usual ending which of course leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel as always a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women killing the main character's friends one by one in typically over the top style lots of t a on display no character development bad acting and overly elaborate bloodshed br br the thing i can't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as <UNK> done its ' the thing is that they aren't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has <UNK> and tells the main character who's friends have now all been murdered usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway <UNK> main character's mother's <UNK> fishing partner kicked his friend's father's dog everybody still left alive throughout the film is a <UNK> but they are more <UNK> <UNK> than suspects as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the <UNK> psycho killer after the motive is revealed br br valentine followed this formula almost to the letter spoiler mini spoiler anyway in valentine the motive was not revealed but more left for you to think about given that the film didn't quite conclude in the typical <UNK> <UNK> way the issue is only part resolved and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been <UNK> by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody will the killer want more or were the demons truly <UNK> br br this still didn't make valentine a good film instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual which still doesn't count for much to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines please don't originality is so important and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre
<START> three daring daughters is a <UNK> sweet rose colored look at divorce <UNK> and single parent living obviously social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted takes a cruise and then dates and marries a band conductor even when the its just a movie phrase excuses the script from addressing real life problems <UNK> suffers from too many incoherent high note songs children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader <UNK> iturbi playing himself isn't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married br br admittedly this movie was released in the <UNK> forties only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make <UNK> a tolerable film
<START> if edward <UNK> was the the flicks watching this film then that's what he would scream out in horror br br i'm sorry folks but <UNK> enough we had get carter the italian job <UNK> and now this what's the similarities no it's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star maurice <UNK> and the other stars another great british actor the main common <UNK> in those originals is the <UNK> of the films they weren't made to impress hollywood they were quirky english films with a unique charm atmosphere that just cannot be <UNK> in the usa the word is cult and what better way to destroy a cult film than to <UNK> it with a remake or even a sequel br br wicker <UNK> had a tough task before it even hit the road wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films it defies genre intelligent scripts a grade actors the music score set pieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film br br so here comes a remake don't worry no originals were <UNK> in the making of this remake some major aspects of the story needed to be <UNK> for the modern usa <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but that's just about the whole premise so we give the cop a <UNK> style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares then with no mobile phone <UNK> on the island that sorts the communication out but in the real world this wouldn't happen cops just don't go missing give him a blood link for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake <UNK> thin though isn't it br br it's just that it was all laid on with a <UNK> the name <UNK> were simply hammy almost carry on there was no sense of community on the island no centre of town to catch your <UNK> just a few houses <UNK> about a forest and that was it <UNK> was just annoying by not giving out any info at all and cage was useless to let her get away with it when he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it the screenplay was <UNK> all the way to the end and you just wanted it to hurry up and end the <UNK> was absolutely hilarious and didn't know when to stop br br that ending is probably the best way to <UNK> the difference between the two one ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day the other ends with a post production explain it all to the <UNK> type conclusion br br i loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film i left thankful in the knowledge that this film will probably end up beneath a highway somewhere only this time mercifully forgotten forever
<START> spoilers if such a thing is possible as a <UNK> robin williams fan i felt it necessary to buy this film as first on screen appearance wow i could not imagine a more mind numbing movie essentially the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle <UNK> would tell you after dinner and <UNK> them robin williams plays a lawyer in a 30 <UNK> skit br br i'm all for <UNK> humor but this humor wasn't pleasantly vulgar or <UNK> it was just mind numbing there are no redeeming qualities to this film other than robin williams fanatics like me who simply have to own every piece of film
<START> i notice that the previous reviewer who appears to be still at school gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel the major problem i had with this 1999 version was the casting of anthony way as tom long anthony way was a talented boy <UNK> who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini series the choir i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in the choir unfortunately the small boy who appeared in the choir had grown into a tall and <UNK> youth by the time <UNK> midnight garden was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as <UNK> tom it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom as played by anthony would <UNK> the far younger <UNK> in the 1989 bbc version tom and <UNK> are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack <UNK> version of a true classic as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version <UNK> well over <UNK> 00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under <UNK> 00 need i say more
<START> greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman nina <UNK> julia ross who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position julia <UNK> the position and is hired by a mrs hughes dame may witty who requires that she lives with her <UNK> in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and julia tells them she has no family and is free to <UNK> her entire time to this job george <UNK> ralph hughes is the son of mrs hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery this strange family all live in a huge mansion off the <UNK> coast of england and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense
<START> men in black 2 was a real disappointment for me while the actors did a pretty good job especially smith there just isn't a cure for a poor script once in production the movie really had a sequel kind of feel playing off partial events of the first film the story was in a word bad at best it wasn't thought out well and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times br br in the first flick the <UNK> organization had a kind of elite force feel you had a few special agents and it had a <UNK> kind of feel to it in the sequel the <UNK> organization has a <UNK> summer camp vibe br br the movie wasn't terrible or anything it just lacked the <UNK> for lack of a better phrase of the first movie a lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second and didn't really add any originality to the <UNK> universe br br a perfect <UNK> would be episode 1 to the first 3 films was it decent yeah is it worthy of bearing it's title not really
<START> peter sellers plays dick <UNK> ha ha a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one although he's witnessed a treasure being buried he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he <UNK> becomes blank thus dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts do you place an ad for that and help lead a path to the treasure it's mind <UNK> how anyone could have <UNK> this pointless film former <UNK> spike <UNK> replaced <UNK> as director and given <UNK> talents in the film the <UNK> class you can probably guess which of the grainy poorly lit scenes had <UNK> in the director's chair peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain he's probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and <UNK> so that he can keep this off his resume <UNK> looks dashing as the handsome power behind <UNK> but he and <UNK> both look pretty desperate with even <UNK> makeup and hair looking quite terrible they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it with lines like these i can understand any possible <UNK> br br pierre about to be <UNK> you'll pay for this br br <UNK> no i won't i'll do it for free br br and that's one of the good jokes it's amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the <UNK> but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the well received british tv program a show called fred starring sellers <UNK> and directed by the great richard lester
<START> sorry this movie did not scare me it just annoyed me it was just so frustrating when i saw the potential and that all that fell by the <UNK> the children the father the <UNK> had so much potential and <UNK> zero <UNK> i have heard it all before scary no i can scare myself alone here where i sit than they could in the movie are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying huh this movie was quite atmospheric or at least it could have been had the director writer bothered to work it we could have had some good music that would have added to the tension too if someone had made the effort what i really want to know is why do they get the money just give it to me and save all that <UNK> abandoned no we where betrayed
<START> when i went and saw this movie i had great expectations but i had so wrong this movie was exactly as every other horror movies it's a virus zombies etc exactly as resident evil and many many other movies but the difference with this and other movies is that the story is very week it's bad actors and boring music the photo is ok but the rest is total crap don't see this horror movie go and see the ring 2 or any other movie who's much more of a story i hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies we have seen enough of that the only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous infected celebrities
<START> <UNK> ugly might have been much more effective if the film makers had made it an r rated guilty pleasure exploitation film with plenty of nudity but since the pg 13 rating is what all the studios are wanting these days we end up with a movie like this a pg 13 <UNK> flick that isn't allowed to go nowhere near as far as the movie should have gone br br the script is go generic that it is easy to guess what plot point is going to occur 15 minutes before it actually happens the acting is adequate but the characters are so paper thin that nothing could be done with them there were also a lot of points where it seemed like i was watching a music video rather than a movie br br the film's only <UNK> are the amazingly beautiful female leads we get to see them in some extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits but only so much could be shown due to the pg 13 constraints there's plenty of <UNK> and toned <UNK> bodies doing some well choreographed dance numbers but there's no nudity or sex to speak of <UNK> banks she keeps getting even more insanely beautiful with age is also in the movie for a very small amount of time sexy newcomer <UNK> <UNK> is also very easy on the eyes and she has a killer smile and shows some genuine acting potential br br the only people i could see this movie appealing to is pre <UNK> boys who aren't allowed to watch r rated movies yet that audience might get a lot out of it from a <UNK> aspect but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated br br rating the movie 1 the women 10
<START> okay we've got extreme verhoeven violence although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks we've got plenty of sex and nudity but something is missing oh yes it's missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his sci fi movies i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor but unlike most verhoeven films the movie itself doesn't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films br br what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story not the cast or characters but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible the crew has truly made an invisible man without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano <UNK> and other practical effects effects done on set the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visible br br the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more <UNK> here it takes place at a lab for the most part i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it or let's say steal something from people's <UNK> or something like that but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie grade b
<START> this early <UNK> short was so much fun to watch the second on disc one of d w <UNK> years of discovery dvd set highly recommended it features three excellent performances by the main leads and interesting to see henry b <UNK> the little colonel birth of a nation as a campy musician giving a <UNK> the eye and other things br br the <UNK> husband goes <UNK> at his wife's betrayal and has her <UNK> into a little room with her <UNK> it's kind of incredible that they wouldn't hear the wall going up but hey maybe the wine had something to do with it here mr johnson father of silent player raymond <UNK> <UNK> wildly and this adds to the melodrama but in an unexpectedly comical way the best moment comes at the end as the lady passes out from shock and fear once she realizes she's doomed henry picks up his <UNK> and fans it over her the way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy and i just lost it and laughed my head off the expression on his face from that moment i was <UNK> by henry b <UNK>
<START> wouldn't it be great if not another teen movie actually put an end to all of these stupid pointless i'm getting more sex than you are teen movies in a perfect world yes yet this one is even worse this one is not <UNK> for the stars it's <UNK> for the <UNK> all of the jokes are basically college students exposing stuff that people probably have no interest in seeing yet it's funny <UNK> <UNK> who was actually good in final destination is just plain dull in this movie it makes you wonder if it's being bad on purpose grade f
<START> i so love this movie the animation is great for a <UNK> movie the cgi looks so awesome i love the music in the movie so great they kept the japanese music br br as for the story its great it has a great feeling of friendship <UNK> is a very cute and powerful <UNK> ash is really great in this movie and i like his friendship with sam the only thing i didn't like was <UNK> appearance he just suddenly pops up helps ash co a bit and leaves they could have made his part in the movie a little bigger br br but overall awesome movie can't wait to own the usa version on dvd
<START> i loved this movie i knew it would be <UNK> full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank <UNK> and julie <UNK> all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the <UNK> you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original <UNK> episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
<START> as much as the movie was good i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie <UNK> from sweden but from <UNK> maybe i wrong and in that case i'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and <UNK> me
<START> the cult of personality has <UNK> the status of roger corman sam <UNK> lloyd kaufman etc as kings of the <UNK> because the folks at crown international were so key they haven't been <UNK> to the status they richly deserve a film like the van may now seem like a <UNK> piece of drive in <UNK> but it was a <UNK> hit when it was released not to mention subsequent re releases as a double feature with other crown hits br br the van was a perfect example of <UNK> hit <UNK> of <UNK> upon the mood of movie goers at the time of a film's release here it was sex drugs rock <UNK> roll and the brief <UNK> van <UNK> as others have noted it is ironic that the hit song in the film refers to a chevy when the title vehicle is a dodge in the film itself i had a town <UNK> where i was at the time even <UNK> these <UNK> to be <UNK> of sin on <UNK> a perfect ad line for the film br br there are the usual assortment of good and bad girls muscle heads and low brow <UNK> including a supporting bit by danny <UNK> in many ways this isn't much different from the old beach party movies of the 60's but now <UNK> up with nudity and drug use obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule the film <UNK> along pleasantly enough with a <UNK> charm that <UNK> for some by today's standards certainly un pc views of women br br the classic touch is a <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> of sin on <UNK> yes a <UNK> hey you gotta have something hot for those <UNK> br br <UNK> fest
<START> this movie had a good story but was brought down because it didn't have enough horror film elements and violence it was like watching a live action cartoon it would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played <UNK> for where the series was going
<START> after seeing this excellent film over 100 times i still find new things that blow me away with this movie great special effects incredible acting and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well best movie ever
<START> twelve monkeys is an insane time travelling action packed movie that stars bruce willis who plays james cole a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in november of 1996 unfortunately he is sent back too far to the year 1990 where everyone believes that he is insane br br this movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from bruce willis brad pitt and madeleine <UNK> twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that i believe anybody can enjoy terry gilliam has created a true masterpiece br br 10 10
<START> although this isn't a great film there's something compelling and memorable about it like another <UNK> on the film i saw this in childhood it's been thirty three years since <UNK> but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously <UNK> title see it if you have the opportunity you'll feel like a <UNK> of small town life as it <UNK> through the decades more than any other film this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early <UNK> century progress it's engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one furthermore it's easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time
<START> i was to young to ever know much about prince but in the past few years i've seen a lot of purple rain novelty <UNK> and i thought they were cool but i didn't want to buy a shirt i knew nothing about so one saturday it came on <UNK> and i decided to watch it i didn't know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out in the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as the kid all the performances where great to me but my favorite were purple rain darling <UNK> and i would die for you all the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when <UNK> cried described what he was feeling i also like how clever prince was with the way he <UNK> with <UNK> i liked when prince and <UNK> first met in the club and he stood behind her standing and then once she turned around he disappeared great movie and now i cant even find one of those <UNK> shirts
<START> getting lost in space frozen for 15 years that's unlikely falling into a star improbable falling into it the day it goes <UNK> and explodes ludicrous getting rescued by a ship just then priceless br br no it's not <UNK> <UNK> heart of gold to the rescue it's also not the parent of the year <UNK> after <UNK> her daughter to two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on an abandoned spaceship the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they've picked up this <UNK> their <UNK> in hand to hand combat which makes up most of the film's action combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while <UNK> pointing the gun behind him at the other about six <UNK> away who <UNK> <UNK> in the line of fire br br in the end the family of three <UNK> the metropolis sized ship they were planning to use to observe the <UNK> until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave instead using the <UNK> fighter ship which they've <UNK> in one minute with <UNK> pounds of gas <UNK> from a 0 7 <UNK> missile you have to love those hard sci fi <UNK> br br as long as hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant <UNK> they'll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the sci fi channel
<START> <UNK> <UNK> adaptation of rebecca <UNK> book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory <UNK> now there's an original idea it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks this extremely well cast <UNK> brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co stars jackson christie ann <UNK> and ian <UNK> but the <UNK> are all on low there are a handful of good scenes particularly whenever jackson is on screen but <UNK> pacing is <UNK> <UNK> and the film's <UNK> out color is <UNK> long on the shelf this soldier is best left forgotten 1 2 from
<START> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are siblings brought up in single parent families <UNK> the sister grows up in an <UNK> environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and ultimately join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs <UNK> the brother on the other hand grows up in a less <UNK> environment but grows up to be a <UNK> gentleman the story marks <UNK> making efforts to save his little sister who is <UNK> in a <UNK> from a hostile hippie environment this movie stands the test of time commenting that <UNK> and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the face of <UNK> great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and to different people and the director brings forth an eerie feeling to it
<START> three part horror film with some guy in a <UNK> up house <UNK> the viewer not to go out there and unfortunately gives us three tales to prove why br br the first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two <UNK> it leads up to two totally predictable twists still it's quick about 15 minutes violent well acted and well done predictable but enjoyable br br the second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money his car breaks down he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic very obvious badly done and extremely slow even at 30 minutes this is too long good acting though br br the third is just barely a horror story it involves a beautiful lonely woman looking for mr right it has beautiful set designs a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene but again predictable and not even remotely scary br br it ends very <UNK> br br all in all the first one is worth watching but that's it tune in for that one then turn it off
<START> i do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of romania this tells something certainly about the value or maybe about the lack of <UNK> of the film but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in romania compared to other countries even in eastern europe br br the film is an adaptation of a novel by <UNK> <UNK> a controversial novelist who died during the communist rule soon after the book was published it tells the story of an intellectual professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after he is imprisoned on false <UNK> at the end of the <UNK> era basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison the second describes his <UNK> to regain his life after being released his release is actually only apparent romania of the 60s asks from him different types of <UNK> and crimes but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally as in prison br br the film is <UNK> acted by some of the best romanian actors <UNK> <UNK> who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega star we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art although suffering from a <UNK> story telling and falling sometimes in non essential details or character comics the film is still an important landmark for the romanian cinema as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the romanian society
<START> what a time we live in when someone like this joe <UNK> whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker or even a filmmaker at all where are the new crop of filmmakers with brains and talent we need them bad and to hell with <UNK> br br this movie is about nothing just as the characters in the film stand for nothing it's this horrible so called gen y that is full of bored idiots some of which <UNK> themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting well orson welles was a filmmaker john huston was a filmmaker fellini was a filmmaker <UNK> was a filmmaker etc current films like these show just how stupid young so called filmmakers can be when they believe going out with no script no direction no thought no <UNK> <UNK> everything shot horribly on <UNK> no craft of editing no nothing stands for rebellious or advanced film making nope it's called ignorance and <UNK> or just pure masturbation of cinema and there actually is an in your face jack off shot so be ready br br look at the early films of any accomplished indie filmmaker <UNK> morris allen lynch hartley <UNK> <UNK> lee or <UNK> none made anything as tedious and <UNK> as this yet <UNK> whatever the hell is still going to <UNK> every year and <UNK> as some kind of <UNK> new talent it's crap i can't imagine anyone liking this and everything else this so called filmmaker has done all seen by me is just as bad the newer stuff clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience one of the sitcom calling steer clear unless you're a friend or family member of those involved on second thought if you're a family member or friend you'd probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such <UNK> situations br br utter garbage this isn't art this is the ultimate opposite of it
<START> in the voice over which begins the film <UNK> billy connolly a <UNK> for the great 70's band strange fruit said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange <UNK> set was that god was sick of 70's excess indeed it's been popular to put down that era of music and see punk as a welcome <UNK> to it while i agree the excess was tiresome as well as the misogynistic <UNK> which came out of it and like punk i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or <UNK> rock and this film about strange <UNK> long strange reunion is an <UNK> tribute to those days br br one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes brian gibson directed what's love got to do with it about tina turner while i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film the music was handled very well writers dick <UNK> and ian le <UNK> co wrote the <UNK> and were behind the music oriented british tv show over the <UNK> and the songs strange fruit played were co written by <UNK> mick jones not to be confused with the <UNK> mick jones so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about also two cast members are musicians in their own right bill <UNK> i don't know about though the film credits him with his own singing and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was music oriented though i forget the name and he was in <UNK> and the others are convincing at it and while as i said a lot of 70's bands like strange fruit <UNK> badly towards women the movie doesn't make the same mistake except for the woman who follows timothy <UNK> around as the manager of the reunion juliet <UNK> is quite good and plays a fully rounded character br br the other actors are all good as well with special praise to stephen rea who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality there are a couple of plot points which don't work but overall this is quite enjoyable oh yeah and the music is good too
<START> the summary provided by my cable tv guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is <UNK> rock is by far the worst horror film that i have ever seen a title previously held by urban legends final cut from its opening scene i could tell it's going to be really bad but i was so bored that i couldn't care less this film contains laughable acting especially by the guy who's tormented in his dreams incredible as in not credible plot twists and some of the <UNK> music i've heard and i'm living in a period when the likes of britney spears and <UNK> dominate the air waves the biggest problem with <UNK> rock is that it's not funny one would a film as dull and boring and so not scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one liners here and there but no we have tormented guy's self centered friend trying to be funny but came across as annoying instead spoiler and please do tell me who in this crazy world is insane and self loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night no one if you're going to make a horror movie at least make it believable this one is anything but
<START> emma was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid nineties and it was recently shown on british television <UNK> because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with pride and prejudice two years ago we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic becoming jane and <UNK> have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels these include <UNK> <UNK> the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously so the cycle should now be complete no doubt however there will be more to come in the near future there is after all her juvenile love and <UNK> <UNK> the short <UNK> lady susan and someone somewhere has <UNK> <UNK> endings to her two unfinished <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> then there are all those austen sequels <UNK> out by modern <UNK> br br the main character is emma <UNK> a young lady from an <UNK> family in <UNK> england not as some reviewers have assumed victorian england austen died before queen victoria was even born emma is <UNK> considerably better off than most austen <UNK> such as elizabeth bennett or <UNK> price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main <UNK> seems to be finding husbands for her friends she <UNK> her friend harriet to turn down a <UNK> of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious <UNK> mr <UNK> this scheme goes <UNK> wrong however as <UNK> has no interest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his <UNK> makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an <UNK> marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed <UNK> than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications br br emma always insists that she will not marry without affection and when she does find a partner the handsome mr knightley we feel that this will indeed be an <UNK> marriage it does not however seem likely to be a very passionate one unlike say that of elizabeth bennett and mr <UNK> knightley who is sixteen years older than emma she is 21 he <UNK> and related to her by marriage is more like a father figure than a lover much more of a father figure in fact than her actual father a <UNK> and selfish old <UNK> who seems more like her grandfather when emma is rude to her <UNK> <UNK> and tedious friend miss bates it is knightley who <UNK> her for her lack of manners his <UNK> is probably meant to indicate his <UNK> nature <UNK> century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of <UNK> knights with their elaborate <UNK> of <UNK> both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well but this is not really one of the great screen romances br br of the other characters i liked juliet <UNK> vulgar mrs <UNK> and toni <UNK> harriet i know that in the novel harriet was a <UNK> young teenager whereas here she is more like the character collette played in <UNK> wedding a <UNK> slightly overweight <UNK> <UNK> about her chances of finding a man nevertheless i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from <UNK> themes br br emma is one of <UNK> more light hearted works without the darker overtones of <UNK> park or even pride and prejudice and this is reflected on screen we see a world of beauty and grace full of <UNK> homes and elegant costumes and fine manners apart from the <UNK> <UNK> who make a very brief appearance the only poor people we see are mrs bates and her daughter and as they live in the sort of <UNK> rose <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which today would change hands for over <UNK> 000 we can be sure that their poverty is relative not absolute in <UNK> world poverty is defined as not having your own <UNK> home this is of course not a <UNK> picture of early <UNK> century life but nobody has ever claimed austen as the <UNK> equivalent of a kitchen sink <UNK> sophisticated romantic comedy combined with a keen eye for <UNK> human character was more in her line br br i would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994 sense and sensibility or the recent pride and prejudice it tends to drag a bit in the middle although it has a strong beginning and strong ending but it is in the main a highly enjoyable austen adaptation 7 10
<START> i had the pleasure of viewing this movie early and i have to say i thought that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of bachelor party starring tom hanks which i thought was pretty good i was right in all honesty i thought it could have been better sure there were some funny moments but it just didn't seem to hit the mark with me the acting was ok and the storyline pretty well follows the original but i think it could have been so much better this movie i'd say is for teens and the young of heart full of female bodies alcohol and sex it's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again 4 10 is my vote for this one
<START> can only be described as awful it is bad to start with and then gets even more bad when you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse but fear not because it does another poorly written script for a <UNK> director for no talent <UNK> of past movie stars it's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both as for the hero well he <UNK> up everyone including one scene where he beats the living <UNK> out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and <UNK> him against the window with it and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes <UNK> onto <UNK> doesn't even blink then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies this is a really ridiculous movie lucky it only cost me 1 to hire
<START> in 1979 lucio fulci released his film zombi however due to the earlier <UNK> of george romero's dawn of the dead which had gone by that name for its italian release it was <UNK> to zombi 2 which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second romero movie continuing this theme the second zombi film which would have been called zombi 2 was then consequently titled zombi 3 in the uk the original zombi film that is zombi 2 was titled zombie flesh <UNK> to continue this theme the second zombi film zombi 3 was then titled zombie flesh <UNK> 2 for its uk release are you following all this so if zombie flesh <UNK> was <UNK> dawn then is 2 his day of the dead while this is only a <UNK> observation this tale of military <UNK> <UNK> and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague <UNK> resemblance br br some of <UNK> european direction <UNK> in a film like this but the acting dubbing and exposition heavy script are absolutely horrendous its <UNK> message is so forced and <UNK> it can no longer be considered a subtext while there's an unintentionally hilarious birds homage combining this last element with <UNK> 80s rock is not a good idea for some reason i couldn't stop thinking of time of the apes q v the whole time i was watching this this is obviously not a good thing br br while there's nothing here to rival topless <UNK> diving shark wrestling zombies and <UNK> on a <UNK> <UNK> misogynistic <UNK> do get a work out with a hotel <UNK> mouth being ground into a mirror until it <UNK> blood his <UNK> gore <UNK> also see a hand <UNK> both themes are combined when a woman's face is ripped off first by one zombie then a zombie <UNK> that tears out of a pregnant woman's stomach br br production wise this is obviously a step up from zombi coming five years later nine years in worldwide release terms but without the <UNK> low key charm it struggles while <UNK> <UNK> music is inappropriate and uninspired <UNK> <UNK> score was one of the best things about the <UNK> movie here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds <UNK> like bonnie <UNK> holding out for a hero in the middle of this carnage we get an <UNK> love interest and roger and kenny two bland macho types who do everything with <UNK> urgency and constantly state the obvious we're out of <UNK> to a <UNK> gun is a particular standout but where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves low key or not <UNK> original had truly magnificent rotting zombies skull faces worms in eye <UNK> they really were something to behold by contrast this dull follow up <UNK> for the more traditional men with a bit of paint on their faces option br br the climax rips off too many romero movies to even be funny while the use of the dj is a crass and cheap narrative device not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal br br it turns out that fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes the rest filmed by bruno mattei i'm fairly sure that even fulci would have <UNK> at the ludicrous flying zombie head scene and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave unfortunately however it's his name that's above the film title on releases so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a fulci film through and through on that scale then it's a major <UNK> for him for this movie commits what you imagine fulci would regard as the worst crime of all that of being boring
<START> in the year 2006 in cold blood a riveting thriller from 1967 has two new interesting <UNK> that it did not previous have first and most <UNK> is the fact that it's star robert blake was recently on trial for murdering his wife second the recent oscar winning biopic capote showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime <UNK> author truman capote these two new twists make the film <UNK> for a modern audience br br as a stand alone film from it's era in cold blood is top notch in every way most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from conrad hall later of american beauty and road to <UNK> fame many of the stills from this film of the kansas farm house at night or the tree <UNK> back country roads could be sold as fine art photography combined with the cracker jack direction from brooks and superb editing in the early scenes where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be <UNK> slaughtered beautifully <UNK> with the plotting of the two hapless killers a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events it's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is <UNK> to the viewer <UNK> with <UNK> a drop of blood shown on screen br br the film is also <UNK> nicely by robert <UNK> eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet <UNK> brutal side of the killing duo the flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the <UNK> before being sent to the <UNK> and he makes his last confession so to speak it's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting superb writing flawless direction and haunting photography i dare you to <UNK> from your mind the stark image of the <UNK> reflection from the window flowing down robert <UNK> <UNK> face in <UNK> of actual tears br br the only thing <UNK> in cold blood is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the <UNK> and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end the tacked on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey
<START> i figured that any horror film with orson welles in it would be weird <UNK> sure was but it was a little too weird for it's own good the film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a <UNK> of <UNK> witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences by the finale there are too many unanswered questions what's worse as the story is so confusing it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters it seems odd that welles would agree to <UNK> this film especially since he doesn't have that much to do maybe someday they will put out a tape of the <UNK> and <UNK> from this movie now that would really be fun
<START> give this movie a break its worth at least a 7 that little girl is a good actor and she's cute too jim belushi is a comic genius you can't help but feel good at the end i wish there were more wholesome shows like this that you can enjoy with your kids
<START> at the beginning of the movie the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were amazing however the story was so very slow and boring and then the little girl begins to <UNK> the fox which leads to tragic events we live in the forest and frequently see <UNK> one thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from <UNK> this movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it in trying to make a wild creature into a pet i do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be even after the terrible events with the main fox the little girl was still wanting to play with the <UNK> does she never learn her lesson and there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie what a disappointment this movie was and what a horrible story it tells the final narrated dialog was so stupid by which time my wife and i were screaming at the tv i absolutely hated this movie and would never recommend it to anyone
<START> it's a lovely movie it deeply reflects the chinese underground <UNK> current lives if you chinese culture <UNK> rock n roll music there you go i will highly recommend this one but one thing i am wondering is whether this movie has been showed in <UNK> i sorta doubt it d
<START> i must admit a slight disappointment with this film i had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the age of science take up a very small amount of the film the sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards br br much the best drama of the piece is in the mid section and then it plays as melodrama <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> science fiction nature of it all and <UNK> <UNK> dialogue there is far more human life in this part though with the great ralph richardson <UNK> <UNK> over the top as the small dictator the boss of the <UNK> i loved <UNK> mannerisms and <UNK> delivery of lines <UNK> the presence and ideas of raymond <UNK> <UNK> confident visitor this boss is a <UNK> convincingly <UNK> figure unable to realise the small <UNK> nature of his kingdom it's not a great role yet richardson makes a lot of it br br <UNK> itself is presumably meant to be england or at least an english town fairly representative of england interesting was the complete <UNK> of any religious side to things the <UNK> to <UNK> seem to <UNK> around a conflict between <UNK> <UNK> and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on there is a <UNK> attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal <UNK> yet one is left quite <UNK> the film hasn't got much interest in subtle <UNK> it goes for <UNK> spectacle and <UNK> blunt <UNK> every time and of course recall the <UNK> bet finale raymond massey <UNK> lyrical about how uncertain things are br br concerning the question of the film being a <UNK> i must say it's not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right the <UNK> <UNK> have something to them a war in 1940 well that was perhaps predictable lasting nearly 30 years mind a nuclear bomb the super gun or some such <UNK> in <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> we don't believe in independent nation states type government in britain after 1970 hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one <UNK> no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that <UNK> is a very <UNK> anti war sentiment generally it is assumed that <UNK> whether <UNK> <UNK> fascist as under the boss or all hands to the <UNK> scientific <UNK> will be the deal and these <UNK> are not <UNK> while we must remember that in 1936 there was no knowledge at all of how <UNK> and communism would turn out or even how they were turning out the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the <UNK> vision on other matters br br much of the earlier stuff should and could have been cut in my opinion only the <UNK> stuff from <UNK> would have been necessary yet this segment tends to get rather <UNK> and it is ages before we get to the richardson massey parts i would have liked to have seen more done with <UNK> scott who is just a <UNK> <UNK> cutting a flashing eyed <UNK> figure to <UNK> purpose the character is not explored or frankly explained or exploited except for one scene which i shall not spoil and her relationship with the boss isn't explored but then this was the 1930s and there was such a thing as <UNK> <UNK> censorship back then edward <UNK> is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless <UNK> praying for war only to be <UNK> put down by another massey character massey himself helps things a lot playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and <UNK> gusto <UNK> well with a largely <UNK> cast save for richardson and scott and <UNK> slightly br br i would say that things to come is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936 one of the few serious british science fiction films to date indeed its set piece design and <UNK> of resources are <UNK> marvellous br br yet the script is ultimately over earnest and at times all over the place the direction is prone to a <UNK> though it does step up a <UNK> gear or two upon occasion the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an <UNK> sense of wonder at technology and an engaging jerky performance that consistently <UNK> such a shame there is so little substance or real <UNK> conception to the whole thing powell and <UNK> would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this they are without <UNK> among british directors as daring visual <UNK> great <UNK> of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate br br things to come as it stands is an intriguing <UNK> well worth <UNK> yet far short of a metropolis <UNK> much as silly in <UNK> words as that lang film yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it
<START> prison is set in <UNK> where work on a new prison has hit a problem so the state board decide to re open an old state <UNK> that has been closed for 20 years warden <UNK> <UNK> lane smith is put in charge 200 odd prisoners are <UNK> in they are put to work <UNK> the <UNK> prison up including burke viggo <UNK> who is ordered to break into the old execution chamber he <UNK> <UNK> but when he <UNK> the <UNK> up door an intense <UNK> of light shoots out all the <UNK> gas fire around the prison goes crazy for a few minutes burke has <UNK> unleashed a deadly evil force which is in the mood for some killing no one is safe br br directed by <UNK> <UNK> i thought prison was a poor late 80's horror flick that seemed to forget about the small point of having a story the script was by empire pictures regular c <UNK> <UNK> who was responsible for writing such <UNK> as class of 1999 1990 puppet master iii <UNK> revenge 1991 puppet master vs demonic toys 2004 amongst other low budget horror crap that even i haven't heard of seems to take itself very seriously the biggest problems i have with prison are that it's far too slow it's over 30 minutes into the film before the <UNK> <UNK> is even released although the pace does pick up towards the end but by then it was too little too late as far as i was concerned then there's the fact there's no discernible storyline here at all for a start it never tries to explain why there's an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up in the old execution chamber it never explains why this force decides to kill random inmates when it's supposed to be out on a revenge mission or why it just doesn't kill warden <UNK> straight away no explanation is given to where burke fits into it even though he looks exactly the same as the prisoner who was <UNK> has come back there's no real explanation as to how the warden is connected to everything that's going on apart from two early nightmare sequences in which he seems to be remembering something although it's never revealed what it is or why to be honest i couldn't really give you a plot synopsis as the film doesn't have a rigid story which it follows all the way through the character's are dull forgettable the murders are few far between the pacing is way off the whole film is a mess even ghosts can't shoot straight when it comes to trying to shoot the hero a less than satisfactory way to spend 100 odd minutes there really are better things you could be doing br br director <UNK> full american flick debut he does a good job there's a decent atmosphere but after over an hour of constant drab dull dark prison cells corridors i started to get bored i just think the look of the film is far too repetitive bland frankly lifeless i didn't think it was scary the gore is pretty tame apart from the best moment in the entire film when a police guard gets killed when a load of <UNK> wire <UNK> itself around his body face with a nice close up of his throat being torn open other than that there's a burnt corpse a <UNK> body which falls from the ceiling very little else there is a scene when the warden burns all the prisoner <UNK> in front of them then makes them stand all night in their underwear in the yard i was watching this scene thought that you'd never get away with doing something like that over here prisoners have rights if the warden did something like that there would be a national <UNK> from all those <UNK> every prisoner would sue the warden the prison service the government for everything they had they'd win br br with a supposed budget of about 4 000 000 prison actually had a pretty healthy budget although it doesn't really look like it on screen sure there's a decent cast the few special effects that are included are good but overall it's set in the same location with limited ambition prison was actually shot in a real <UNK> state prison so it certainly looks the business the acting is alright prison proves that sometimes hollywood stars not only have one crap horror film <UNK> in their <UNK> but in the case of <UNK> he has two with this the awful the return of the texas chainsaw massacre 1994 both of which i'm sure he'd like to forget about br br prison is a dull lifeless <UNK> <UNK> waste of 100 minutes despite one good gore scene i didn't like it at all as i actually prefer my films to have a story rather than seemingly random events incidents <UNK> together with no narrative sense
<START> i watched this film along with every other adaptation i could get my hands on including seeing plays in <UNK> for some academic research the cinematography is very moving as is the music unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story i have never seen such an awful portrayal of mr rochester all of his most fundamental traits are gone where is his wit where is his passion scott's rochester more closely resembles <UNK> foil st john than the character from the novel in fact the actor playing st john in this adaptation played a passionate st john while scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling which he does all the time i have no idea what they were thinking i would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography but i honestly can't bear to see this film for too long because of george c scott's performance
<START> the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is <UNK> up things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on screen for some weird reason did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out right other than that this is very good quality all the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life for the shallow women out there it's worth watching at least because toby <UNK> as gilbert is the <UNK> thing ever if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on him br br sort of a spoiler the ending scene is a funny <UNK> of what happened in the book
<START> a young <UNK> in sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client when he arrives he finds that he is made less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not liked to speed things up he decides to move from the local <UNK> and take up <UNK> in her home a house that is usually <UNK> and approached only by a <UNK> that is <UNK> off by the sea most of the day once there he sees visions of a woman in black is she real or imaginary he is also subjected to the blood <UNK> cries of a <UNK> and child apparently drowning in the <UNK> these events take their <UNK> on him and he soon becomes quite terrified atmospheric tv adaptation of a famous play by susan hill that spends it first third building up its characters before moving to the creepy country house its poor colour contrast give away its tv roots immediately this really should have been in black white but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments still though after waiting so long to see it i must say i was sadly just a little <UNK>
<START> the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission as cheech and chong drag that big <UNK> garbage can across the parking lot filled with gas don't <UNK> it man hilarious stuff and then as 'the <UNK> ensues you're in for one heck of a ride i watched this film recently and it holds up being just as funny upon each viewing check it out
<START> disney what happened i really wish the movie had been set in the 60's like the book was and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption i'm glad that maybe someone might be influenced to read the books but the man with red eyes <UNK> as it and what's up with the <UNK> <UNK> where was that in the book peter jackson save us a long time ago 1978 i heard that there was european version of this film i sure wish i could id it i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption this movie needs to be <UNK>
<START> though not a fan of sam <UNK> i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of <UNK> ' heck i wasn't even aware he was in <UNK> until i started the movie so it goes without saying i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie not the leads a sort of <UNK> baby ' 'the <UNK> or any other demonic kid movie <UNK> was billed unfortunately it fell flat slow incredibly slow and flat yet i continued on to see how this would all resolve hoping beyond belief the ending climax would shed some light on the subject okay i admit it did a wee bit but what a stale closing and what a low low budget movie or at least that's how they designed it a person falls  you don't see the drop you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood a person gets hit by a cab  you don't see it you see someone complaining holding a bike up i'm not sure if this is called style or <UNK> or simply lack of <UNK> for special effects we have a rich family with a crazy mom a <UNK> father attempting to balance everything a kid  joshua who may may not be the <UNK> and a new born baby girl who cries a lot she cries as much as we see how many days she's alive  and what was that about are there rats above or is it joshua is his mother nuts is joshua crazy is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family is he going to grow up to be michael myers or does he drive his family to the brink i don't think so they were nuts prior and no so called acting could make me believe otherwise unfortunately barely any questions were answered barely any open doors shut i'm sure that might have been the idea but for <UNK> sake give me something anything there are plenty better kid gone wild movies to explore <UNK> more like the mini me of the <UNK>
<START> this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories i note both of them are based on short stories examination day is set in the future year unknown but at a point where they have cake <UNK> that light themselves huge tv looking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age and the examination day a point where 12 year olds must <UNK> a government required iq test the kid is this story <UNK> jordan david <UNK> is just celebrating his own <UNK> birthday and is a smart kid so is calm even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will <UNK> at based on his school <UNK> his parents christopher <UNK> and elizabeth <UNK> on the other hand say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score and while their reason includes that they believe he's capable and he should have no need to worry it's pretty obvious they are worried i won't give anything away in the ending but i will say this there's a point where we get a glimpse of what's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another his parents ask <UNK> whether he'd prefer to watch tv all night by today's standards we'd be pleased he'd say he'd rather read and not just because there's nothing worth watching but why would his family ask this the flavor of what's encouraged and <UNK> in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison <UNK> which i hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen i only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the <UNK> man was i found it to be better than the short story it was based on i haven't read the one that a message from charity was based on but would like to since it was interesting a 16 year <UNK> boy peter robert <UNK> <UNK> is suffering a fever from <UNK> water that has always been common in his <UNK> hometown but he is able to see through the eyes of a young <UNK> woman suffering the same type of fever charity payne <UNK> <UNK> who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him they both recover especially since it's common for that to happen in 1985 but the connection doesn't go away charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company especially peter who has promoted <UNK> in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students even at the college he's been staying in one place at things take an unexpected turn though when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 <UNK> will <UNK> from england as a sign of <UNK> added to the fact that she was <UNK> death from the fever not so common in <UNK> the two try to learn a way to save her the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times through a lesson warning that sounds like something rod sterling would've <UNK> up and entertainment make cheerful watching as <UNK> that friendship love and wisdom do a great deal probably 3 4 of this has no theme but somehow i think it all would have been <UNK> by <UNK> crew
<START> bill and ted's bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched though the acting and scenery etc is poor who cares the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent the ideas are great as well i recommend anyone to see this classic the best part is obviously when they <UNK> death i was cracking up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film this is so much better then the first one which was great as well possibly the funniest movie of all time i think the best parts of the film however are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo it was hilarious rock on bill ted and eddie van <UNK> bring out a 3rd film
<START> this was one of the worst films i have ever seen br br i usually praise any film for some aspect of its production but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film br br most common was the <UNK> that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an <UNK> <UNK> it er ok br br also trying to out <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> style is not gonna work running 10 feet into some trees is not gonna work alas it does here as mentioned before the <UNK> <UNK> and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous in an <UNK> space with limited <UNK> a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea br br anyway about 5 minutes of the movie <UNK> itself and <UNK> some appreciation however if you have a <UNK> of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate br br it pains me that so many quality stories go <UNK> and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made br br oh did i mention the last five minutes well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in <UNK> <UNK> techniques absolutely priceless
<START> this was a better than average movie i thought for it being on cable i had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as christmas rush or first daughter target shot etc br br the cast was well chosen i especially liked ron <UNK> as the hard pressed <UNK> commander it's good to see him <UNK> the same material he had so much fortune with in band of brothers the producers and <UNK> had done their <UNK> because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in 1997 br br so if you get a chance to see this film and i am sure you will since fx reruns everything 50 times take 2 hours and enjoy it
<START> there is no story the plot is hopeless a filmed based on a car with a stuck <UNK> no <UNK> and a stuck automatic <UNK> gear <UNK> cannot be good i would have stopped that car within one minute whether i was in it or in the police car constantly following it i feel sorry for the actors that had to put up with such a poor script the few scenes that some similarity to action was heavily over <UNK> and as far from reality you can get in addition there were a lot of <UNK> for instance the hood of the runaway car which was popped doing <UNK> at first it just <UNK> over the <UNK> like it would in reality but then afterwards it blew off the car was later in the movie observed with the hood on br br this film was nothing but annoying stay away from it
<START> at the end of the film i just asked myself is it the worse movie i have ever seen or is it the worse movie i have ever seen and the answer is actually after having seen this movie and thought a bit about the meaning of it you just can't find any meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes which are unbelievably brutal and useless it seems to me as if the director tried to push this question into the <UNK> head what are such crimes compared to horror of war and <UNK> because i noticed that the two awful scenes where directly connected to war and it's horrors during the first scene you can here the girl that is being raped screaming and in the same time you hear one of president <UNK> speeches about the necessity of starting a war with iraq and in the second scene the pictures of the three criminals sticking a sword in a woman's <UNK> are directly followed by archive pictures of world war ii but as a matter of facts i really could not think about the relative gravity of <UNK> two different kinds of human <UNK> expression being done i was too shocked by what i had just seen and felt sorry for bad english
<START> this <UNK> entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say enough already of course it isn't nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the <UNK> job done in 90 minutes eric phillips don wilson is an undercover cop in the near future when his wife is framed for murdering the <UNK> by a team using a look a like cyborg it is up to eric to clear her name wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg <UNK> why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me being a <UNK> production there are tons of car chases exploding cars 4 in the first 5 minutes and shoot outs i particularly liked the van that <UNK> in <UNK> before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in <UNK> <UNK> it is merely a chance to show off some <UNK> <UNK> man effects circa 1995
<START> this movie was horrible br br they didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly it was a definite sleeper you'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but d wars surprises you with even a let down in that department br br also the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick and i seriously mean that br br i was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad please whatever you do people don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d wars
<START> sergeant <UNK> is accused of being a <UNK> during the korean war a hanging offense a long drawn out court <UNK> ensues during which time the sgt must remain in a military jail after much investigation the defense attorney attempts to <UNK> the doomed non com with an <UNK> hour <UNK> very good picture
<START> the saddest thing about this tribute is that almost all the singers including the otherwise incredibly talented nick cave seem to have missed the whole point where <UNK> intensity lies by delivering his lines in an almost <UNK> <UNK> cohen <UNK> the full extent of his poetry his irony his all round humanity laughter and tears in one br br to see some of these singer <UNK> make convoluted suffering faces launch their pathetic <UNK> in the <UNK> effort to scream i'm a singer is a true pain it's the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as <UNK> imagine nothing simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and <UNK> of the original if there is a form of art that doesn't need <UNK> it's <UNK> art <UNK> cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make up of sex for sale br br in this <UNK> tribute i found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful <UNK> and awful <UNK> all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and if truth be told several of these singers sounded as if they had been <UNK> at some asylum talent show it's cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material really not the other way around they may have been friends or his daughter's he could have become very tender hearted and in the mood for a gift too bad it didn't stay in the family br br fortunately but only at the very end cohen himself performed his <UNK> tower of song but even that flower was spoiled by the totally <UNK> background of the <UNK> all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the <UNK> home br br a sad show really and <UNK> if you truly love cohen as i do
<START> <UNK> is an idiot but he is aware about it and acts in consequence his life is totally boring and he doesn't know how to change it when his last friend <UNK> dies he feels totally empty and he decides to go out to become drunk when he is returning home he crashes with a girl that puts <UNK> although she ignores him he <UNK> in love and starts to follow her <UNK> well the beginning of the film is a bit slow and can result boring for most people however as action begins it is a little better not much maybe the best part is the 5 minutes of sex almost 30 different scenes about it that you can see in the middle of the movie it is not good for the <UNK> but for the funny and unexpected that is the scene probably it is the best of the film neither the actors nor the directing is good and the results is a boring film that that can result funny for some people not for me all the film is based on absurd situations idiot as the film says that have anything interesting i like <UNK> <UNK> but i have to admit that this is not one of his best films maybe his worst he knows to do it better
<START> is it just me or is that kid really annoying br br <UNK> sister spends most of her time running around after the <UNK> little so and so as for him well i know he's a kid n all but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree so far i'm only half way through and am fascinated by the story but the people in it let it down i just hope it gets better by the end as i can't not know what it's all about although some supposedly <UNK> messages in the <UNK> on the wall and a <UNK> indicate everything is backwards i e dog is god live is evil etc just seems a little obvious at the moment yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning as yet anyway if my opinion changes at the end of the movie i'll update this post but if your reading this then well see above statement
<START> contains spoilers also my quotes may not be exact br br everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels how true but to me i see this movie as much more than that i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him but it won't stick alec <UNK> was the perfect guy to play this his <UNK> <UNK> and eternal <UNK> are so appropriate br br that's ingenious can you tell me what is the ratio of <UNK> to <UNK> br br the only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasn't worked after all standing there almost naked yet more than shame is the simple disappointment that it didn't work he's never really <UNK> by people remember br br but sidney we want to stop it too br br barely a moments <UNK> before he's off trying to get away again does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal must've caused no br br also notable is <UNK> role she is sick and tired of money and power she thinks she's finally found love outside of her father's company at first she doesn't really care about sidney anymore than anyone else but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention she's finally found something she thinks is worth living for the funny thing is that it's not even romance it is friendship but of such an <UNK> nature that the title almost doesn't fit it's more admiration and perhaps even inspiration br br upon her discovery that michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her she gives into cynicism and tries to <UNK> sidney fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power money and lust what a <UNK> br br thank you sidney if you would've said <UNK> i think i'd have <UNK> you br br i love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing but then the <UNK> quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off his <UNK> matching the tune <UNK> where is daphne we don't really know but they weren't really in love and she wasn't really a scientist he got help escaping and she got a shot in the arm of hope <UNK> a <UNK> relationship would've been nice but as billy joel says it's more than i'd hoped for br br
<START> i don't agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the american international pictures basil <UNK> has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile <UNK> in post war england but without the sentimentality of <UNK> jungle the cinematography was excellent as it really captured the <UNK> and isolation of the huge <UNK> estate the estate looked like an old prison stanley baker was excellent as the hardened detective <UNK> to the juvenile division <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> five <UNK> <UNK> he finds he is the butt of many jokes david <UNK> showed that he was one of <UNK> top young talents of the fifties he had a very different role in another stanley baker film hell drivers his portrayal of johnny and the <UNK> following he inspired was very frightening ann <UNK> was also very good as the cynical <UNK> i wouldn't say there was a romantic subplot in it br br detective jack truman is investigating a string of <UNK> attacks by someone labeled the <UNK> just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough he is assigned to the juvenile division he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work amid all the <UNK> he gets his first call out the 6 year old murphy twins are working a <UNK> at the local <UNK> <UNK> br br taking the twins home he meets their brother the charismatic johnny and their <UNK> sister <UNK> he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly <UNK> <UNK> can turn young kids into criminals as he gets more involved with the family he realises there is a strong link between the fires johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a <UNK> the local priest peter cushing in an unusual role away from the hammer horrors explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been <UNK> a hero he wanted to <UNK> the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children's fear the teacher thinking only of her own safety runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened <UNK> br br i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war br br highly recommended
<START> is this the worse star trek <UNK> episode maybe at least it gets my vote as being in the bottom 5 i mean this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense seeing something that makes you go mad give me a break this episode also has a different feel to it the music is <UNK> almost forced to enhance a feeling of distress to the point that it sucks give me some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> higher beings like <UNK> or anything but <UNK> these are very boring aliens to make an episode around mccoy gets to utter his famous phrase he's dead jim spock puts on the protective <UNK> when <UNK> the <UNK> away but kirk does not they go through that freaking <UNK> now for the third time that i can remember boring at least season <UNK> next episodes would be <UNK> of the gun and day of the <UNK> and others to follow making trek a decent show to watch in <UNK> where it would pick people like me up as avid fans personal observations trek loved to use the color purple its kind of a <UNK> purple like when they are in the <UNK> outside the <UNK> the <UNK> that is normally grey is now purple we never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see i noticed it in several episodes it was done by a light <UNK> and it works very well but in this episode in the ships <UNK> is pretty lame
<START> this film centers on four criminals locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell hoping that a mysterious book of black magic penned by a former <UNK> around <UNK> named <UNK> who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> criminal business tactics <UNK> have landed him in prison with three oddball cell mates a <UNK> <UNK> marcus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> love toy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who eats objects he touches and is in prison for eating his six month old sister and <UNK> his charge as if he were his mother and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who doesn't read or eat breakfast the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day the film follows <UNK> as he reads from the book attempting to understand it's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison <UNK> loves his child and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on <UNK> when she betrays him <UNK> begins to slowly <UNK> with hate and longing to see and hold his beloved son <UNK> <UNK> critic is marcus who <UNK> to be fully female while still <UNK> to several <UNK> traits such as working out and taking a <UNK> standing up he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear <UNK> although deep inside is a world of vulnerability <UNK> is completely under <UNK> control and behaves like a <UNK> to it's master there's even an <UNK> scene where <UNK> breast <UNK> from marcus <UNK> is an <UNK> mystery opening up for us to slowly understand his <UNK> motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain clearly intellectual and holding possible secrets from the others <UNK> is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going soon those who aren't a threat to the book seek their true escape not as much from the cell of four walls but the cell that <UNK> their true desires after a certain murder the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new <UNK> who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book <UNK> away and better yet how to use it a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach br br i'm glad i had a chance to watch this film it does play out like <UNK> <UNK> the characters get what they desire but a price must be met there's gore in the film startling moments of graphic violence but in my opinion this is first and foremost a story driven tale the gore is a product of what the book <UNK> one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man's desire we see <UNK> fate at the end with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an <UNK> melting away <UNK> fate is a masterful effects sequence i will say that <UNK> through eric <UNK> well paced direction always kept my attention and for being such an isolated movie about 95 of the film takes place in a <UNK> location the prison cell it never seems to drag i guess that's a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them
<START> i still haven't gotten to see all of this it's running on cable right now and i seem to keep coming in on the middle of it my main reason for being interested in it is that i'm a bill paxton fan he's a pretty good actor and has turned in consistently good work over the course of his career br br the other thing is that while never really a fan of the old series i kinda liked thunderbirds for the ships and effect work derek <UNK> was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies and his designs for the international rescue craft are wonderful the current team has done a fine job of <UNK> his work to the big screen br br but br br this is one lame story the kids are asked to drive it and while they do an okay job it's hard to suspend your disbelief especially when you have <UNK> eight year old son flying <UNK> an enormous multi ton transport with all the <UNK> of a <UNK> everywhere you look you see a ford <UNK> product placement is way over the top here and it's annoying ben kingsley does an good job as the hood but he can only do so much with a one dimensional role if you can accept the film on its very slim merits thunderbirds is a fun enjoyable ride just don't look too closely at the <UNK> that drives it br br <UNK> i finally got to see all of this and it's worse than i thought the acting is fairly uniformly poor and while the effects are fairly good the story on multiple viewings has gotten <UNK> the overdone product placement for ford is annoying and the kids as central characters <UNK> on my remaining nerves as with the <UNK> if you ignore the source material it's bearable but not very watch the original show and you'll see what i mean br br and a word of advice to jon <UNK> take a <UNK> course at the director's <UNK> you can do better than this old friend br br another <UNK> br br i saw this again last night on <UNK> dubbed in spanish with cheesy comedy sound effects and yes i came in roughly in the middle with ben ron and sophia in their fight scene on tracy island br br i didn't think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse but it was it was embarrassingly bad br br if this had been done straight no kids to the rescue no tongue in cheek jokes it might have worked as it is it's just another beloved childhood joy that's been ruined
<START> amazing acting music a simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through i don't know why it was so fantastic but it simply was so many of the characters were so real it moved me and made me think i would like to watch more like this br br the idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the <UNK> br br the film <UNK> issues of religion prejudice drugs friendship memories difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself
<START> the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor a visual treat to the eye the film fails to <UNK> the mind and heart i was intrigued at first by the idea of <UNK> and boyer leaving religion in order to find their capacity for love what follows is a huge disappointment boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment <UNK> amazing wardrobe <UNK> her performance at times her face is frightening to look at a <UNK> mask as a monk boyer held the formula for the <UNK> <UNK> which reminds me of the true story of <UNK> when he leaves his marriage to god the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that <UNK> organized religion the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past however the journey that follows is all too predictable
<START> this film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics don't usually get offbeat films i thought i'd give it a try unfortunately they were largely right in this instance br br the film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting the sort of feel that is impossible to describe but it's not a good one to further <UNK> things the script is a dull <UNK> thing that is only vaguely interesting br br the immensely talented thurman just <UNK> through this mess creating barely an impact hurt and <UNK> try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script it may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like thurman br br one thing the <UNK> film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the <UNK> in question chase hurt off their ranch with the smell of their <UNK> <UNK> front <UNK> br br because of the <UNK> <UNK> throughout while i wouldn't recommend this film there is entertainment to be had and watching even <UNK> get the blues is worthwhile for something different
<START> the plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in <UNK> one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods soft for digging follows the old man's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a <UNK> of his imagination however there is a problem each time the old man <UNK> the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found soft for digging has a <UNK> dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film an old man living by himself in a house during the film i found that i was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man the rest of the film i have to admit did not engage me i found the <UNK> of the film a little too slow the limited dialogue was not a problem however the development of the story and its conclusions after watching the film took too long i feel more could have been made of the relationship ghostly encounters with the child and the old man alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations children are always scary as ghosts see dark water
<START> this film concerns a very young girl cassie melissa <UNK> who leaves her family and heads off to become a college <UNK> one night cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him as cassie was driving a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a bloody loss of lives along with her boyfriend cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has nightmares which cause her to have hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are who wants her dead and will she survive this entire horror ordeal cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love this is a way out film and not very good at all
<START> i read the book in <UNK> grade and now a few years later i saw the movie there are a few differences br br 1 billy was <UNK> suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days not 10 worms in one day by 7 <UNK> br br 2 billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms in the movie after billy eats all the worms joe has to go to school with worms in his pants br br 3 joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie he doesn't at all br br even though there are changes this movie is still one that kids will enjoy
<START> have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from beverly hills <UNK> were thrown into a <UNK> jail if so this is your movie this is midnight express for the mtv crowd that would be ok but the story was poorly executed contrived plot twists poor dialogue and <UNK> issues abound this slight film did not earn the right to be as <UNK> as it ends up being potential spoiler and <UNK> preposterous plot line the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out this moment is <UNK> played with the same <UNK> and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at <UNK> later the same hotel employee is somehow found and <UNK> is a big city mind you <UNK> been there and <UNK> against the girls as if a couple of free <UNK> <UNK> warrant 40 years in prison c'mon rent another day in paradise instead
<START> yeah i get <UNK> and his <UNK> but at the same time i feel his <UNK> is largely overrated and more than a little disturbing overrated because the supposed realism he introduces <UNK> crowds <UNK> architecture etc are <UNK> by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave in the pursuit of realism <UNK> <UNK> many non actors but their deer in the <UNK> stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off <UNK> and inconsistent feel and frankly many of the <UNK> <UNK> featured people are painful to look at br br and <UNK> <UNK> is disturbing to me at least because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content not because i'm <UNK> or <UNK> i'm neither but because the emphasis that <UNK> places upon <UNK> images and situations is contrary to the neo realism he otherwise <UNK> so it comes off as gratuitous and forced one can almost hear him say <UNK> i've got to stick a cute naked boy in this scene at times it seems that <UNK> is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself regardless of what his audience might prefer br br the <UNK> of the 9 or 10 different stories in <UNK> <UNK> struck me as being a failing of <UNK> as a <UNK> rather than being an aspect of neo realism he seems to get bored with each story and so he <UNK> them up rather <UNK> and with little conviction even the <UNK> final line of dialog in the film which some people seem to find <UNK> why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much <UNK> to me it just makes me wonder why <UNK> would bother making a film if he felt this way in my opinion a far better crafted film and with more homosexual content is <UNK> <UNK> it is also full of bizarre looking people and absurd situations but it succeeds because of its pacing direction and strong storytelling whereas <UNK> fails by those same elements
<START> the groove tube was one of only two ken <UNK> movies the other one being the equally zany modern problems this one is just a full scale parody of tv aside from <UNK> who apparently didn't do anything after modern problems the movie also stars chevy chase and henry <UNK> cousin richard <UNK> the three cast members plus some other people in smaller roles appear in various skits one of the funniest ones features chase in a <UNK> <UNK> commercial in which he's describing the medicine as his wife <UNK> and it ends with her <UNK> him there's also a pornographic news program an irritating cooking show and the epic tale of some drug dealers br br anyway the whole <UNK> just a real hoot in my opinion the three best tv <UNK> movies are this one plus <UNK> and kentucky fried movie although i might also include the truman show really funny br br i wonder what ever did become of ken <UNK>
<START> i watched like 8 or 9 <UNK> movies and none of them had any impact on me br br i watched several documentaries about him he is obviously an intelligent man with great knowledge about films and passion for making them but does this makes him a good director definitely no a complete anti talent he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits but a film with actors  never br br he can't direct nor write his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations and many situations dialogues in his movies are so <UNK> and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word art in any sense no way not to mention the <UNK> direction so amateurish like to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie br br like the scene when <UNK> gets arrested and <UNK> hides in the back of the store who is he kidding br br he is a <UNK> he knows what fake <UNK> and critics want he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty <UNK> never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction br br just look at <UNK> <UNK> if <UNK> can make a movie like <UNK> can then i might re check his old movies and try to find talent in them
<START> the original was a good movie i bought it on tape and have watched it several times and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb the romance was flat the sight gags old the spoken humor just wasn't this may not have been the worst movie i've ever seen but it comes close
<START> tarzan and his mate the second of <UNK> tarzan pictures picks up a year after the events of tarzan the ape man tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle and harry holt one of the <UNK> in the first film returns this time accompanied by the less than honorable martin <UNK> in quest of the <UNK> from the <UNK> graveyard naturally a variety of <UNK> and exciting adventures take place along the way br br the first film <UNK> everything the jungle adventure romance itself wild animals and even death the second film still has a great deal of <UNK> and a lot of wonderful action sequences but a more serious tone <UNK> the action the characters dare to ask questions like what if something happened to tarzan what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to <UNK> for herself while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation it creates a certain amount of <UNK> that isn't always as much fun as the throw caution to the wind attitude of the original br br one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane's relationship tarzan still speaks very broken english but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate additionally their love for each other has really <UNK> and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle br br most people consider tarzan and his mate superior to the original tarzan the ape man personally i liked the first film just a little bit better the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt martin <UNK> team isn't nearly as likable as <UNK> relationship with james parker jane's father from the original the mr <UNK> character could have worked as a great movie villain but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him also i don't want to give anything away but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him jane never finds out about those events so the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been all of these <UNK> are relatively minor however and it's still a great movie br br like the first film tarzan and his mate has amazing action scenes wonderful <UNK> footage and one of the <UNK> all time greatest romances if you liked the first film in the series this is definitely a sequel to see
<START> brilliant movie the drawings were just amazing too bad it ended before it begun <UNK> waited 21 years for a sequel but <UNK>
<START> the ghost of the vietnam war has haunted the american psyche for thirty years now if not because of the fact that <UNK> of thousands of american soldiers went <UNK> in vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that america could be said to have lost many men came home from the war a shadow of their former <UNK> and the original first blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to <UNK> back into the world as the saying goes first blood part ii on the other hand is little more than a fist <UNK> mess that goes to illustrate how sore america can be both in victory and defeat stallone puts in another <UNK> performance as the titular special forces <UNK> while richard crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor <UNK> where it all comes <UNK> is in the script which didn't do any better when it was called missing in action and starred chuck norris what little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big s on <UNK> massive chest br br the film picks up a little while after the end of first blood the film that is the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels in this mediocre follow up rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open air mine as he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with colonel <UNK> who <UNK> him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a <UNK> mission rambo never one to back down from a hard day's violent work accepts and is promptly <UNK> off to a <UNK> base in what appears to be cambodia or thailand i forget which from there he is <UNK> to seek out a camp where american <UNK> are supposedly being held and photograph them his mission quite clearly <UNK> that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release rambo being rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political <UNK> br br of course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people <UNK> <UNK> work have more interest in making sure no american <UNK> are found it is the age old conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for <UNK> the plight of many an american family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official vietnam war had been raging for of course with the <UNK> that was inherent in american society during the 1980s they could not help but work in a plot <UNK> about the <UNK> army being in bed with what appears to be a single <UNK> of russians together the two <UNK> attempt to <UNK> what information they can from rambo but it <UNK> upon them in an orgy of bullets <UNK> rockets and destruction about the only thing missing is the moment when rambo drinks from a grail like <UNK> and declares himself <UNK> br br to be honest first blood part ii is a well photographed and well choreographed action spectacle the hand to hand combat with the larger russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever the rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for americans to <UNK> their fist to fortunately this <UNK> of america <UNK> <UNK> action films soon died down when more <UNK> and intelligent war films such as platoon began doing the rounds some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems the <UNK> commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy the russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous only in a 1980s action film would one see a law being used from inside a helicopter sure there have been action film clichés <UNK> in <UNK> of fact but never this ridiculous before br br i gave rambo first blood part ii a one out of ten it is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny one doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are the only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable
<START> although there were some amusing moments i thought the movie was pretty lame the longer it ran the worse it got once the action entered <UNK> valley i found myself watching the magnificent <UNK> more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters br br the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent first she's in on the deal then discovers the truth and she <UNK> then she's back again then <UNK> them again then she's back again there's no apparent motivation for any of her decisions there were interesting characters some interesting scenes and many missed possibilities i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts apparently the people who liked <UNK> man were inclined to like this one <UNK> 2 0 is no match for the <UNK>
<START> i love it when they actually do a sports story well so many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch not this one it's just a genuinely nice movie an old fashioned type of story and based on a real life guy to did exactly what dennis quaid did in this film he plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out late in life <UNK> speaking to become a <UNK> in professional baseball eventually he reaches his goal of making it to the major <UNK> even if it was a very brief <UNK> br br all the characters in here are nice people the kind you root for from quaid to the players on his high school team to his little boy <UNK> t jones now somewhat of a star on television br br quaid is believable in playing jim morris because unlike actors in the past in sports films he knows how to throw a baseball he looks like a <UNK> a guy who could fire it 90 plus miles per hour and most of this film is true as <UNK> by the real life <UNK> in one the documentaries on the dvd br br so if you're looking for a nice inspirational true life sports film you can't wrong with this one
<START> i went to school with jeremy earl that is how i heard of this movie i don't really know if it was in the <UNK> at all i don't recall the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school <UNK> the acting is ok not great the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny so the only comment i can give this movie is eh i borrowed the movie from jeremy if i was in a movie rental place this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldn't recommend it to anyone past middle school age i've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed the <UNK> is <UNK> or just outdated many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable
<START> this movie took me by complete surprise i watched it 2 or 3 times i really liked this film there were many truths this movie brought up i love all the characters in this film as well this movie makes a lot of sense because as society becomes more advance what does the culture loose not to sound preachy i can really relate to this movie from my child hood and <UNK> apart of my life that will never come back or ever been the same this film is on my top 5 movies i have ever watched there is just such a raw truth that i feel when i watch the movie and its not the kind of truth that you have to dig for its right in front of your face the creators of this film did a great job and i enjoyed this movie very much this movie may not be for every one but if you have an open mind i think you will love it
<START> sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones well that's my opinion anyway this one will always be in the bad movie category simply because all but <UNK> <UNK> performance was terrible br br martial angel tells of cat <UNK> <UNK> a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover <UNK> <UNK> julian cheung two years before but her past returns to haunt her as <UNK> <UNK> is kidnapped for the <UNK> of security <UNK> <UNK> to the company cat works for in order to rescue him she calls on her old friends from her <UNK> days six other <UNK> women to save the day br br i may have told the synopsis <UNK> but this is a cheesy story in fact the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice paper in water if i could sum it up take a bad jackie chan movie remove the comedy remove the choreography throw away the budget and you have martial angels a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at all br br mind you i do have to give credit where <UNK> due and <UNK> <UNK> was probably the only person to emerge <UNK> from the terrible action as it was her performance that <UNK> through okay you can't say she was excellent after all she had absolutely nothing to work with but she did manage to dig some character out from her role other than that only sandra <UNK> and kelly lin made any other impression although these were mostly <UNK> and very brief br br elsewhere the film just fell to pieces scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen poor editing involving numerous <UNK> in fight scenes camera angles that were <UNK> and <UNK> and direction i've seen better from a lost dog br br i guess this film was a too many <UNK> affair most probably the budget was blown away on the over enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen that didn't leave much else br br frankly the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn charlie's angels it ain't in fact while sisters can do it for themselves none of that was really that apparent here br br definitely one to forget
<START> this is my first review on imdb i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now i feel compelled to add my perspective and no i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way yeah yeah how often did you here that before <UNK> i'm in my late <UNK> br br 1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style the characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie after all it's a fairytale like world but the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this the blue bunny like mini dragon <UNK> the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie he is already an instant classic much as <UNK> from ice age the story is not too surprising a bunch of anti heroes have to go out and <UNK> the biggest dragon you can imagine but who cares if the movie looks and sounds that good 1 thing i have to point out imo the movie is not suited for very young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6 8 i would say these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo anyway i had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high <UNK> to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it br br 8 5 for me
<START> across the great <UNK> which we call understanding there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early <UNK> <UNK> in every instance there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much <UNK> there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the <UNK> time ' in this movie called the last wave an <UNK> native is murdered for no apparent reason when those responsible are arrested they remain silent less they <UNK> the order of things david burton richard chamberlain plays the defense attorney assigned to defend the accused although haunted by <UNK> images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic <UNK> named chris lee david <UNK> burton proceeds to defend the <UNK> as <UNK> law and therefore not subject to standard justice the movie is <UNK> with puzzling dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island <UNK> and doom black drama and deep <UNK> are what gives this film it's frightening <UNK> and therefore is not for the faint hearted in fact the <UNK> haunting <UNK> can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers good silent drama
<START> i must say i thought i had seen it all i am an extremely jaded movie buff this movie didn't shock me by any means i'm way past that point but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn't know i could go to i had no idea i could ever find <UNK> the idea of <UNK> erotic never never never ever ever but there you go he did it i have to give the director credit he pulled it off br br for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn't a mistake then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married then some nervous guy <UNK> then we see briefly a hot chick getting it on with a butler but this is very brief at this point i was <UNK> the movie out loud while trying to stay awake in fact i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night br br we finally get the good stuff when a girl who knows who she is or who anyone is in this movie has a dream about a victorian era gal being <UNK> by a beast thing in the forest the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat <UNK> <UNK> of the whole deal it's beautifully shot superbly edited and does deliver the goods they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn't either oh well i would definitely recommend this film the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself and my tv but the last 50 minutes totally <UNK> it
<START> the comment by <UNK> 1 hits the proverbial nail on the head for this turkey of a program but it is a hoot to watch william shatner <UNK> and dance yes the marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv and it does rate a few stars for one viewing or so to see shatner who seems to have taken camp to new heights whether in a role or as himself but the guy is funny br br the girls who are in the <UNK> areas with the game data <UNK> will be pretty much out of luck when this turkey is canceled unless there is a revival of the <UNK> a go go genre with a <UNK> demand for <UNK> young women to dance in <UNK> <UNK> once more br br i watched the first contestant who was annoying and literally dumber than a post yet through sheer luck walked away with a quarter <UNK> or so the second contestant somewhat more intelligent but who'd be lucky to gain 1 000 on <UNK> got <UNK> by the card which requires answering a special question which he didn't know and thereby left with <UNK> br br this <UNK> of game shows which <UNK> and sometimes award large sums to everyday individuals are admittedly a cheap effort overall to attempt to woo viewers even if the host is well <UNK> and they give away six figures in an average episode i suppose that the <UNK> versus costs can be <UNK> since you don't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures per episode with some big <UNK> deals as well br br but i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long this one has already pretty much reached this point i think his offerings especially with james <UNK> and the others on boston legal should give us a satisfying <UNK> of bill <UNK> offerings br br again the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and <UNK> perhaps one time that should be sufficient
<START> what a master piece to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future this film is satire of the highest order in my humble opinion it <UNK> dr <UNK> br br the clever <UNK> of the two <UNK> as the <UNK> and the market cons being <UNK> and market the west outstanding the clever use of gen <UNK> was ahead of its time only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic <UNK> robot <UNK> <UNK> the issue head on in 1989 br br the message of this film is about the <UNK> of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government this movies screams don't do it you fools you'll kill us all br br excellent 10 10
<START> many mystery stories follow the standard <UNK> path murder most foul gathering of clues <UNK> of possible <UNK> <UNK> of red herrings and inevitable showdown between clever <UNK> and even more clever crime <UNK> br br forgotten <UNK> the well <UNK> and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly tied package might <UNK> some but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> with the question what does an evil person look like br br excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily forgotten
<START> the movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong shannon lee and introduces two very <UNK> side characters through the first half but later something happens and all the sudden shannon turns into this straight faced second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it's own context the second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clichés bad acting a horrible plot and even worse stunt <UNK> not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the <UNK> mafia gang br br game of death 2 was bad and <UNK> bruce but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played bruce lee back then i truly believe that she can do much better than this and i hope she <UNK> in a better production next time br br if you are a real hard core action fan and don't care about quality go ahead and see this movie i was personally looking forward to it but just got terribly disappointed
<START> a young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up unfortunately the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad he wants his <UNK> back when he discovers who has the bucks he begins trying to get it back he keeps getting <UNK> by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil man's hands sounds familiar i'll bet very predictable not interesting at all come up with something a bit different ok guys
<START> this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot is awful and the acting is worse the jokes that are attempted <UNK> suck don't bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this and if for some reason that you do want to see this movie don't watch it with your parents
<START> this is no art house film it's mainstream entertainment br br <UNK> of beautiful people t a and action i found it very entertaining it's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating it's a fun film to watch jesse and <UNK> are funny too which is just <UNK> definitely worth a rental br br so in summary i'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl if she likes to see other girls get it on br br the villains are good too <UNK> corey large the <UNK> guy from heroes very nasty villains
<START> opening credits great music just right for this film cinematography sleazy to great effect br br harrowing excitement in a train wreck sort of way this is how out of control some lives can become wonderland depicts drug induced <UNK> and its consequences not as an <UNK> but shows how it really does happen in our society it is better than depictions of another wild group <UNK> because all <UNK> films books etc concentrate so much on <UNK> insane mind rather than the overall picture of the cheap fame and <UNK> that is so <UNK> nowadays br br if you want to see some of the best method acting on film watch kilmer in this movie he shows how the method can be riveting in the right role br br the filmmakers here succeed in raising out of control to the level of an art form not just for the sake of giving us cheap thrills
<START> those of the instant <UNK> era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count the fact is the empty <UNK> is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done br br if you avoid the indie <UNK> because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back story could have come off the back of a count <UNK> box the empty <UNK> is the movie for you br br set in the <UNK> <UNK> of the rural american dream the empty <UNK> is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six month old baby as the <UNK> weak relationship falls apart a larger story plays out in the background at night a <UNK> dark mass <UNK> from a sun baked <UNK> <UNK> on their farm and seemingly <UNK> anything in its path leaving no sign that it was ever there br br the film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening and ends with a well executed ending that <UNK> with just enough left over questions to <UNK> the writer director's faith in an intellectual audience br br there seems to be a sub text concerning the death of the american dream but i would hardly call the film an allegory riveting well acted and technically <UNK> the empty <UNK> is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love
<START> the psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out its often billed as an anti <UNK> movie but its really not that simple here are come apparent <UNK> that make me wonder just what if anything they're trying to say about <UNK> br br they <UNK> introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction all of them having parents who are divorced alcoholic and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they're <UNK> <UNK> them to succeed tom hanks is arguably the worst off having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead br br its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives and sure enough at the end when they go to see <UNK> hanks they're all happy and well <UNK> <UNK> on their adult careers problems solved games put away daniel doesn't even want to design computer games any more and even <UNK> mother who's been constantly drunk and <UNK> is suddenly the happy <UNK> looking fresh and bright and <UNK> flowers br br sure <UNK> suddenly and quite <UNK> it seems decides to commit suicide but the reason seems to be entirely because he's a lonely boy genius who can't get a date and not because his character dies as in the famous jack chick <UNK> which happens afterward anyways and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end daniels game and get everyone to come play his in fact the <UNK> of live action role playing in the <UNK> seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself and in what may be the coolest <UNK> scene in the whole movie kate looking very <UNK> in chain mail looks right at the camera and says something like the scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds br br the biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two <UNK> passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty homeless looking guy of his magic <UNK> the recurring theme a the way we were for the 80s might have been poignant at the end but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place and for one final mystery our hero wearing full <UNK> <UNK> has a psychotic break becomes his character completely and <UNK> on his quest so of course the first thing he does is change into 20 century street clothes br br so maybe the movie's irrational but i guess its dealing with an irrational topic in those days a circle of kids with <UNK> and <UNK> was regarded as <UNK> and possibly possessed and you could go insane if they spoke their <UNK> <UNK> at you the anti game paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene where the reporter asks the cop whats going on the cop says a kids lost in the <UNK> and there's a chance <UNK> and monsters is somehow involved the reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game although he allows his own children to play it then turns to the camera and <UNK> off a polished <UNK> that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation in the end its no masterpiece but interesting as made for tv movies go
<START> <UNK> wasted a lot of tv time talking about the <UNK> as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day puerto <UNK> they were not the truth is that the <UNK> and the spanish were and she knows it what kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick with an obvious black daddy cousins and <UNK> pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day puerto <UNK> but barely mentioned how <UNK> influenced the way their spanish is spoken the food and music she is so typical and i lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does also since she wants to dance around her african <UNK> then she need not take more roles associated with <UNK> i e <UNK> blues we can find a <UNK> black <UNK> next time thank you <UNK> <UNK> gina <UNK> gina <UNK> and melissa <UNK> br br to the puerto <UNK> on here that said they are african and not black thank you we blacks certainly do not have anything in common with you so there is no love lost but since you are probably in the states and have <UNK> from the civil rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood sweat and tears from the backs of the blacks you share nothing with br br if i am correct puerto <UNK> have a terrible image in the media but we blacks do not spend our time trying to <UNK> you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and <UNK> of all <UNK> to maintain mindless <UNK> however you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior you are not also you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is bet again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood try visiting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> texas charlotte n c trust me none of those blacks want to claim your culture either

<START> if i write a review about a movie maybe it will stick with me but generally i expect that i will have forgotten i've seen this one a mere two weeks from now so why bother because again i find myself watching a low rated movie that was fun to watch i didn't expect i'd to be able to stay in the room while it was on br br it wasn't great but at least it was not unbearable not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe it was just sweet fluff and if you can't take it stay in the locker room boys i agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted <UNK> and won't be a total bore to an adult br br it offers a few good chuckles here and there but <UNK> a side <UNK> sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining but at least it doesn't suck as so many have said it does maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides br br i have a tendency to grade on the bell <UNK> so a 4 5 or 6 is actually an okay all around rating in my book giving it a 4 makes sense and will <UNK> its rating at the time of this writing giving it a 1 or a 10 as most have done thus far makes the rating numbers meaningless i cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff or that i am even bothering to write about it am i missing something br br anyway it should be noted that emma roberts performs her role as <UNK> quite convincingly <UNK> <UNK> often written into b <UNK> roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due you might also recognize bruce <UNK> playing leonard though his role is <UNK> br br surely you can miss this one if you are an adult but if there is a pre teen girl in your life rent this movie for her and be prepared not to hate it you might even enjoy it
<START> when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isn't bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting cliché lines and sub par camera work i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie
<START> prom night is about a girl named donna <UNK> snow who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night and by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies br br now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg 13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately are you tired of stupid girl dialog <UNK> my <UNK> and talking about <UNK> things and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying and the last thing are you tired of the us <UNK> asian japanese and chinese films that pretty much sums up prom night but i'm still not done with the review br br the only reason to see <UNK> <UNK> is to crack a laugh at the kills if not don't see prom night you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall and by the way the deaths are repeating like 24 7 so not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to <UNK> too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of <UNK> my gosh it's our <UNK> i understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate br br if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films i'd be the first one too i'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a <UNK> to die <UNK> when watching the film br br 1 star out of 10 p s if i could give the film zero stars i would
<START> i have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when i saw this film this film <UNK> the power and art to hamlet that it was always meant to have even those oh so famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways and the cast is incredible <UNK> the <UNK> star it is his charisma power and command of the role that <UNK> the movie making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length where one would expect the dark gloomy cliched castle we are treated to a <UNK> feast for the eyes the only <UNK> comes from hamlet himself as it should well worth your time all four hours of it
<START> this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store we had to get it with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie
<START> the second alternate gundam universe tale g gundam being the first gundam wing is yet another different view into the gundam <UNK> the familiar elements are found but gundam wing is actually different then its counterparts the biggest being the <UNK> are nothing more than terrorists <UNK> one lone organization in truth the series doesn't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict the eve wars don't happen until the later episodes br br the greatest <UNK> of this series are it's characters all the main characters are fleshed out throughout the <UNK> episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in another great plus is the fantastic character and <UNK> design of the series the designs put some of it's other gundam counterparts to shame br br one of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard <UNK> fans claim rip off of the original <UNK> saga why gundam wing gets this rap when the more apparent <UNK> clone of gundam seed is out there is beyond me true there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well br br take for example the usual comparison of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> icon <UNK> <UNK> throughout the series <UNK> is more the <UNK> in the alliance and in ways oz as well while the red <UNK> was shining symbol of <UNK> another big difference is the fact <UNK> loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other <UNK> he's given in the early episodes killer of his own men <UNK> isn't given this label br br the problems with this series isn't the philosophy <UNK> <UNK> but two problems the first is the <UNK> animation footage of the <UNK> attacks sure it's fun seeing heavy arms attack tanks ms and planes the first time but on it's fourth re use scenes like this do get old br br the second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year if you really think about all the events <UNK> in the series a lot happens in just one lone year br br but i guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the <UNK> first lines every so often as it ranks this is probably the best of the alternate universe gundam tales and a great introduction into the gundam world after all this was the very first gundam anime to air in the us television
<START> this film was a yawn from titles to credits it's boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted admittedly this was director richard <UNK> directing debut but who on earth green lit a script as poorly developed as this one looks like another money down the drain government project scottish screen are credited surprise surprise i nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one please please mister <UNK> what ever you've been doing prior to directing this <UNK> of a film go back to it
<START> i have passed several times on watching this since i figured it was some dumb sappy dated romantic comedy well it is a romantic comedy and maybe a little dated however it is not overly sentimental touching as it does on themes of office politics adultery and loneliness you think you know exactly where things are headed but there is an element of <UNK> that keeps your interest and not everything turns out quite as you had expected but there is enough wit and charm to touch the most <UNK> <UNK> if you meet someone who doesn't like this movie seriously consider how well you want to know them
<START> up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga which finally ended in 2005 i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long running series the varied action scenes and really different characters <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> creatures etc made this a particularly appealing movie br br none of the action ever focused too long in one spot either the last half hour <UNK> this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser duel between luke skywalker and darth vader br br another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in fighting between two of the stars gone was the <UNK> <UNK> between carrie fisher and harrison ford finally everyone was on the same page it was nice to see br br in the end this was simply a wonderful adventure tale more than anything else
<START> this is a must see for <UNK> movie fans but it also holds up well against mainstream movies i think we have the <UNK> of the next woody allen or br br <UNK> <UNK> here br br the budget is painfully low no special effects whatsoever and they seemingly used <UNK> lighting shot in digital video and yet this movie grabs hold of you and never lets go the screenplay is somewhat bizarre yet the actors and director pull it off with complete realism it has humor it has intrigue and it has pathos and it all works together br br no point in describing the details if you want to see an <UNK> br br masterpiece a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works see this one br br oh yeah it's also really entertaining br br
<START> if you love kung fu films and you haven't seen this movie you are cheating yourself this movie is one of the only kung fu <UNK> that could be recommended for fans of all types of film normally it takes a die hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films but this one has it all the story is well told and complete the fight scenes are great and tend to end before you're completely bored with them unlike <UNK> tiger throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie see this one at all costs heck my wife even enjoyed it br br wu du it br br 9 out of 10 br br
<START> the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a <UNK> the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called <UNK> where he meets a princess who he falls <UNK> in love with but <UNK> to him the evil wizard <UNK> is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her <UNK> soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat <UNK> <UNK> peace to <UNK> and marry the princess during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic <UNK> that takes abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider that's really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen br br this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses <UNK> flying <UNK> and <UNK> that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their <UNK> it doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time the production designs are just stunning in this movie from the <UNK> to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter even though this movie is over 40 years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema the music and songs are also well done anyone who sees it will no doubt <UNK> i want to be a sailor <UNK> on the <UNK> as one of the great musical moments in movies i'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my <UNK> but i'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie br br what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like two towers and silent hill way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place one of my favorite shots in two towers is the one where we see the <UNK> opening the black gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially <UNK> labor and that's what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie they're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings br br it's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of <UNK> got their inspiration the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the <UNK> genie right down to the flying carpet it's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that i'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie i first saw this as a kid in the <UNK> and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it's amazing that's a true testament that a great movie can <UNK> the test of time sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when <UNK> under today's standard br br if you ever wanted to see a live action version of <UNK> then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea
<START> laughter is a state of mind says the tag and i hesitate to comment on barry <UNK> what could he have been thinking during the making of toys when he watched the rushes did he see a successful funny fantasy if so then he's working on a different plane than i this is an excruciating picture one in which the production design is 90 of the thing and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment robin williams and most especially joan cusack are <UNK> as brother and sister of a toy <UNK> who are <UNK> as <UNK> of the factory when their dad dies there's nothing remotely funny satirical or slapstick wise on display here it is uniformly <UNK> ugly and one of the very worst big movies ever made no stars from

<START> i swear i could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting the script the direction and the general feeling of this movie it's been a long time since i saw a movie that actually made me choke from laughter reflect from sadness and feel each intended feeling that comes through in this most excellent work we need more movies like this mike <UNK> are you listening

<START> straight to the point the groove tube is one of the most unfunny <UNK> and downright horrible films ever made this comedy is so void of anything remotely resembling a trace of wit that it's almost incomprehensible that it was even made i said almost because there are fans of everything after all br br this film isn't even good bad or enjoyable bad to put this movie on the same level of entertainment as plan 9 or robot monster would be a crime to those films films like that you can actually watch and get a kick out of but this film is so bad so poorly made acted and scripted and so incredible stale that there just isn't even a trace of camp or schlock to be found br br even though this was made before saturday night live premiered comparisons were probably inevitable i'm not a big fan of snl but this film is worse than the worst snl skit you can find and man that's bad just to keep the men viewers from leaving <UNK> throws in a pair of breasts every so often but poorly filmed breasts from 1974 aren't going to <UNK> anyone these days <UNK> this film is so poorly made and is such a sleep inducing <UNK> i doubt if they excited anyone in 1974 either br br a man named ken <UNK> made this film i swear to god any ten year old with a video camera could have made something funnier and more clever it's just downright unreal this is truly an unbelievable film the jokes and gags are so <UNK> that even little boys who like to sneak <UNK> porno <UNK> out at night won't laugh br br i will give this film one thing the very last sequence the dancing man sequence where a guy <UNK> on the streets of nyc dances to a tune is easily the best thing in this horrible film not that the dancing man sequence is that great either it definitely has its moments of not being clever as <UNK> desperately tries to fill in the time for the entire song but it actually was somewhat watchable the part of this sequence where the cop starts dancing with the man is the one sole trace of <UNK> in the entire film no wonder <UNK> put this sequence last again while not so great itself it easily beats anything else in this film br br otherwise this film is such a complete piece of crap it's <UNK> as to how an actual human being can be so downright <UNK> the name of this film should have been ken <UNK> <UNK> it's amazing that this was made but many truly talented filmmakers can't get in however i will say that i bet the geniuses at <UNK> would love this movie total garbage
<START> this movie deserves credit for its original approach it combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling unfortunately it falls flat on all levels the films biggest weakness is it's <UNK> to commit to anything it has camp <UNK> and epic elements without ever committing to any of them as for the story itself <UNK> de <UNK> is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable <UNK> innocent <UNK> into a most <UNK> and rude <UNK> br br most likely two types of people will see this <UNK> or <UNK> speaking as one of the latter i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly <UNK> <UNK> treatment of a beautiful story
<START> i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie except when the <UNK> and bullets started flying i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to <UNK> everyone and anyone but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat if i'm correct ralph <UNK> did that movie too it involves a cat that goes through hard times with family streets jobs etc when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out because <UNK> was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter ralph <UNK> also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man
<START> it does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people first off not many seem to have seen it in the first place i just <UNK> into it by accident and then judging by the reviews and the rating of those that did many did not enjoy it very much br br well i did i usually tolerate gere for his looks and his charm and even though i did not consider him a great actor i know he can do crazy pretty well i liked his mr jones but this performance is all different he is not pretty in this one and he is not charming his character is completely different from anything i had seen from him up to that point old ugly broken determined and gere in what to me is so far his best performance ever pulls it off beautifully i guess it is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you cannot imagine anyone else doing it instead think hopkins as <UNK> <UNK> or washington as <UNK> in training day that is how good gere was here br br the rest of the cast were fine by me too i guess i would not have cast danes in this role mostly because i think she is too good looking for it but she actually does an excellent job holding her own with a gere in top form which is no small feat <UNK> easily delivers the best supporting act in a part that requires a considerable range from her i actually think she owns the key scene with gere and danes and that is quite an achievement br br so what about the rest of the movie apart from some excellent acting the story is perhaps not hugely surprising some <UNK> ish aspects to it but adding the veteran breaks in rookie storyline to the who <UNK> and also like silence of the <UNK> adding a sense of urgency through trying to save the girl and the impending retirement of <UNK> character all that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life that's a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes but it is done well and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to them br br direction and photography were adequate i could have done without the modern music video camera movements and cutting but then i am an old <UNK> and it really wasn't all that bad in fact i think it did help with the atmosphere of the movie which as you might have guessed by and large isn't a happy one br br worth seeing
<START> this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an <UNK> in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial rip off of the earlier universal soldier which also <UNK> the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that <UNK> needs to <UNK> his ego every few years and <UNK> still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes <UNK> norris and arnold look almost talented br br perhaps <UNK> should take the leslie <UNK> track and do send ups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him
<START> at least something good came out of damon <UNK> misguided attempt to <UNK> the mafia guys and dolls the seemingly <UNK> stage musical was captured on film in 1955 by joseph l <UNK> all about eve in a colorful enjoyable movie that featured an all star cast including vivian <UNK> from the original broadway show jean simmons whose character bears an odd resemblance to audrey hepburn in roman holiday and two of the all time great leading men frank sinatra and marlon brando both of whom had recently won oscars for best supporting actor from here to eternity and best actor on the <UNK> and were on the top of their game one listen to brando singing luck be a lady tonight speaks volumes about where the early dylan got his voice <UNK> <UNK> steals the show as nicely nicely johnson who brings down the house with sit down you're <UNK> the boat the <UNK> <UNK> leonard adds yet another page to his <UNK> gallery of screen gangsters the film has a bright cartoonish look <UNK> the pop art of the early 1960s the characters speak in a stylized <UNK> apparently based on <UNK> <UNK> although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated it's all great fun and even the gentle kidding of the salvation army is harmless and reflects no real <UNK> toward organized religion just seeing sinatra and brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie but it has lots of other <UNK> to offer during its <UNK> minutes
<START> this is one of the few films where i consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book the story is clear accessible amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional i <UNK> the <UNK> rendition of 'the old home <UNK> and the charming <UNK> <UNK> a great combination of early animation real actors techniques which though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece the background of the second world war worked well and was not <UNK> as the film got under way which so often happens in <UNK> stories br br an often far too underrated film it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages the performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed guaranteed to put a smile on your face
<START> i have to admit i don't remember much about the characters or the story though i'm not sure there was one i was <UNK> irritated by this movie that i had a bit of a hard time focusing on it how can you name a movie keys to <UNK> and then film it in texas the flat desert country around <UNK> i think that was the location in no way resembles the green rolling hills around <UNK> and a celebrity in <UNK> would have a much <UNK> neighborhood to live in obviously no one in the movie has ever been to <UNK> or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even <UNK> it hadn't anyone at least seen <UNK> or the <UNK> i know this sounds <UNK> but i can't help it i watched this because i love james <UNK> and i usually find eric <UNK> interesting but even these two intriguing actors could not <UNK> up this meandering and mean story of self involved people who are not in <UNK> i'm sorry it can't be more expensive to film in <UNK> what if to live and die in la had been shot in toronto would that suck well so does this
<START> italian born <UNK> has inherited from her deceased lover karl an ultra modern and isolated house in the middle of the woods it's winter and she meets the mysterious caretaker leslie who eventually ends up not only just looking after the house but also that of <UNK> as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings and a growing attraction between the pair br br what was i expecting a thriller indeed but it wasn't quite so that's just the advertising on the package for ya i'm quite <UNK> about everything the title the story and the motivation so how to <UNK> it well this wooden character drama is more a <UNK> moody romance bound story of alienation possession and <UNK> twisted into a <UNK> passionate relationship of two masked individuals co writer along with william dafoe and director <UNK> <UNK> art house film is just too <UNK> distant and <UNK> with its mysteriously <UNK> story which it leaves you questioning what does it all really <UNK> although when its sudden conclusion <UNK> you'll thinking why should i actually care what we go through feels <UNK> with <UNK> exposition of dead air that focuses of insignificant details and images <UNK> dialogues can contributed to many awkward developments but more so make for an <UNK> experience as it never <UNK> deep enough like it believes it does the sexually <UNK> activities <UNK> in just never convince and are far from erotic they are kind of a <UNK> in the already <UNK> flow the base of the plot makes for something interesting and fresh but it's never fulfilling and i thought <UNK> be more to it then all of this dreary lingering <UNK> direction is <UNK> stylish and suitably gloomy to want she <UNK> but everything feels like it's in slow motion and can get caught up <UNK> the same views most of the action stays at the one <UNK> the house camera work is <UNK> taut but the <UNK> musical score can get a bit ridiculous when it goes for some dramatically stabbing music <UNK> that served little sense and purpose to the scenes <UNK> <UNK> plays it <UNK> and william dafoe sleep walks the part he looks dog tired while seymour <UNK> <UNK> his head in now and then br br just where is it heading is anyone's guess well that's if you can wait around for it i think i'll give it the benefit of the doubt as it's definitely not what i was expecting from this indie film
<START> i picked up time <UNK> because it looked like a nice low budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn't expect a <UNK> christian film br br the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being our hero who is a bible professor from the <UNK> eventually travels forward to the <UNK> and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil jesus is nowhere to be found this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> wells style time machine the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film earlier or perhaps immediately later can't remember for certain our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific <UNK> could only be considered <UNK> if it could be matched with what the bible says what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful br br in any case that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time so if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible <UNK> then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn't a very strong believer as i don't think there's any evidence and none was offered for the physics of time travel in the bible so immediately there's a problem with mixed messages and credibility there but never mind br br after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases it was also fun to not have it <UNK> down to an exact year as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself a car <UNK> a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date it's just two thousand and <UNK> some of the shock went on a little too long though for instance the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he's invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van he sticks his head out the window like a dog might is scared by the <UNK> and the starting engine etc that seemed a bit off since he'd been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic in any case that's easy to ignore the rest of the tech shock was well done especially his first encounter with the tv which was <UNK> because he didn't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote br br unfortunately our hero predictably starts to <UNK> to virtually everyone he meets as if he's an authority on all life and religion just because he's from the past and is an elder eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful but mostly was just more of the same a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy go figure and investigate his name they eventually conclude that he either is a time <UNK> or is <UNK> this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is the movie frames these guys as non believer bad guys for being skeptical br br just before the professor is to head back to his own time he is confronted by those two men in an effort to avoid being arrested or <UNK> away he eventually breaks into an almost insane like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he's a prophet so they should listen to him just in time he's <UNK> away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he'd heard so much about br br the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self <UNK> and most likely false prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when <UNK> he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god given knowledge that was stated or even hinted at br br as i understand it revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the <UNK> professor trying and failing to send a bible into the future first <UNK> then <UNK> etc as the scene fades out clearly he's trying to determine the exact date of the end times which he shouldn't be able to know essentially the entire premise of the movie <UNK> itself out because by being so <UNK> on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only it means there couldn't ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know the entire movie's premise <UNK> and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it <UNK> it's own credibility in the end
<START> the premise to this movie was one which focused on the <UNK> of of <UNK> in the united states this was a highly <UNK> scenario in america <UNK> two entirely different cultures <UNK> what justified such <UNK> <UNK> actions anyway as this film presents the scene while <UNK> and smith <UNK> these two men were not <UNK> nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs it was a clear cut case of cold and <UNK> <UNK> basically these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect anytime past 1975 we as a nation have <UNK> an empathy for <UNK> who have been <UNK> by their environment however this incident takes place in 1959 this dreadful revelation <UNK> us and <UNK> the nation into a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> with the recent release of the movie capote based on truman capote who was the creator of the documentary in cold blood the american people have <UNK> a new found fascination with this film robert blake played the role of perry smith one of the villains in this movie this is seemingly appropriate given the <UNK> he has been involved with concerning his personal life in cold blood centers on the element of the unexplained there was no vengeance involved there was no material gain to be acquired there was no potential for social <UNK> here either this is merely an instance of a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> anger which ends certainly did not justify the means the <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> and smith <UNK> about were always ambiguous under the circumstances why then should they take their <UNK> out on an <UNK> unsuspecting and innocent kansas family will <UNK> grandpa <UNK> plays the <UNK> attorney who is <UNK> by this act of macabre <UNK> his argument is thoroughly convincing his <UNK> being these two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours this is a line of logic which would <UNK> me to render a verdict of a conviction if i were to be one of the members of the jury absolute disdain for your <UNK> plight in life does not serve as <UNK> for <UNK> a capital crime it was <UNK> instincts that <UNK> that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the american <UNK> attention as it turn out it was a <UNK> of things to come in cold blood did just that this incident was the calm before the storm relating to a <UNK> aspect of <UNK> to the radical 1960's such a lethal <UNK> also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would <UNK> many typical americans for the future br br truman capote does a tremendous job on <UNK> this savage <UNK> with his book which was a best <UNK> and with this documentary as well the acting in this film by robert blake and scott wilson as well as people like john forsythe was incredible the director richard brooks cat on a hot tin roof <UNK> jungle elmer <UNK> and key <UNK> to name but a few was outstanding in his <UNK> efforts in this movie i think that in cold blood is one of the best films in the history of movies the film depicts two <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> who <UNK> into demented <UNK> and wound up captivating a trite <UNK> for being acknowledged at a <UNK> <UNK> level this movie <UNK> a psychological <UNK> which <UNK> on an <UNK> <UNK> of counter culture <UNK> of violence our <UNK> <UNK> are incredibly different now than they were in 1959 this movie introduces the american people to the emotional and <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> such a <UNK> <UNK> in our overall value system i recommend to everyone that they see this movie in cold blood was the <UNK> point to the film capote think about it making a movie about a movie <UNK> a rare and <UNK> <UNK> in hollywood in the case of in cold blood it is an extreme example of a movie which is <UNK> <UNK> intellectually <UNK> and of course it goes without saying in cold blood was utterly <UNK> as well as a totally remarkable movie
<START> i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and the <UNK> mountain el <UNK> de las <UNK> is something like the <UNK> movie in the set br br the movie had nothing to it to hold my attention at all the plot was incoherent the dialog seemed improvised the acting was poor the characters were unsympathetic br br the best scene is the beginning with an <UNK> woman that is driven to burning her seemingly <UNK> daughter however the only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie is the lead character mario who has the most <UNK> mustache ever but that's it br br the film was not effective on any level the music was too <UNK> the lighting was very dark so that some scenes are almost completely black it really is barely watchable what more can i say
<START> when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows melissa joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show <UNK> the cat he was immensely funny the first few season in my opinion were the best where sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life they were most funniest most entertaining and most um good i'm not a fan of when they started introducing brad and <UNK> cause i quite liked valerie but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season if you're gonna have new people at least keep them i didn't like josh he was a <UNK> t i preferred harvey but then he disappeared and they got rid of <UNK> it would have been awesome if <UNK> had been <UNK> in <UNK> seven years and mr craft as well if him and <UNK> got married that would have been gold then sabrina moves out of her aunts house and into <UNK> miles <UNK> house i didn't like <UNK> people either it didn't really seem they liked sabrina sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be <UNK> out of her life and into they're own stupid story lines i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old re runs were back and i was like <UNK> <UNK> lol i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terrible they got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show then suddenly she lets those two <UNK> move in to the nice house when they treated he like dirt and now she's working at some magazine shop so they're putting loads celebrity guest stars into the show if they're in every episode it kind of ruins it the programme just really went downhill and lost its <UNK> i saw the last episode it had the aunts in it <UNK> was reduced to a candle and she's about to get married but she runs off with harvey the end i would have liked to know what happened after well thats my review and the only thing i can say is the only thing that stayed it's appealing self through the seven years was <UNK> the cat
<START> 0 5 10 this movie has absolutely nothing good about it the acting is among the worst i have ever seen what is really amazing is that everyone is awful not just a few here and there everyone the direction is a joke the low budget is hopelessly evident the score is awful i wouldn't say the movie was edited brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase it combines serial killings voodoo and <UNK> cards dumb dumb dumb it is not scary at all the special effects are hopelessly lame laughably bad throughout the writing was <UNK> bad the cinematography is real cheap looking and very grainy sometimes and the camera work is dreadful again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are cheesy
<START> the female lead was a terrible actress which made the whole movie mediocre she was smiling too much when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter this should have made the police suspect her i would have been <UNK> in the identical situation she seemed way calm for a mother who could not find her daughter it was as if she did not want to even be in the movie jennifer aniston would have played the part better and it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial important subject everyone else was excellent i don't know where the lead actress is but i hope she got some acting lessons
<START> i considered myself to be quite melancholy especially when i watch a great touching and tear <UNK> movies but not for this one which surprised me and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly br br there are several disturbing facts throughout the movies 1 despite guilt ridden ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past i find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of <UNK> action some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly in the end this was a disturbing action to me br br 2 the movie story line is over <UNK> but the logic is over <UNK> <UNK> blood type match is required to be an <UNK> <UNK> toward the end of the film we <UNK> that emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the <UNK> within short time period nevertheless it seemed that ben had the rare blood type same as hers which allowed him to be her <UNK> and conveniently despite the <UNK> of ben's blood type he was able to <UNK> not only his heart but also his <UNK> his <UNK> and his bone <UNK> which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also <UNK> <UNK> br br 3 why the doctors allow ben's organs being <UNK> despite the <UNK> <UNK> he used to kill himself br br i might be over <UNK> the whole story as after all this is just a movie however some disturbing facts <UNK> above hopefully will help you <UNK> your plan to go to watch this movie if you go for a soap opera type of film go for it but it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment give this one a miss
<START> this is a perfect series for family viewing we gather around the tv to watch this on bbc america it is an up to date version of robin hood and it appeals to children and adults alike our teenager and <UNK> <UNK> both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching <UNK> next exploits we can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free on demand viewing br br the wardrobe has a spot of current fashion there is a moral to each story it is entertaining the violence is not over the top or needless the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a john <UNK> feel to it it is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair br br there is so much garbage on television from brain rotting reality tv to senseless violence you should take this for what it is and that is an updated robin hood not to be compared with the movie exploits of errol flynn this is a gem to be enjoyed by all parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed he is a robin hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a <UNK> than fight maid <UNK> is also an appealing role model for young girls rather than stand by and do nothing she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the night <UNK> the sheriff of <UNK> is deliciously over the top wicked just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between billy joel and tim <UNK> guy <UNK> is played by an extremely handsome actor one that makes most women wish he didn't have portray the role of a bad guy br br the only question we have is where is <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i will admit that i'm only a college student at this present time an english major at that at the time i saw this film i was a high school student i want to say junior year but it may have been senior hard to remember my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my <UNK> physics course an interest in quantum <UNK> that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the <UNK> aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like i'm not a <UNK> by any means br br that said br br this movie is simply terrible it's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is my mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i'd seen with the films logic and science and they are numerous and she <UNK> my claims because oh so a high school student knows more than all those people with <UNK> in this case apparently so br br leaving behind the fact that <UNK> a <UNK> doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or in fact intelligent leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to <UNK> half the film leaving that behind the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when in fact he completely opposed them br br i could go on and on but i think <UNK> did a really good job of <UNK> the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so br br http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> it is written in stone that disney animations simply must be musicals right where show me because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for not containing the hokey made for five year old standard disney musical fare br br while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been it was still quite good enjoyable and adventurous i had hoped for a bit more yes considering the subject matter but this movie is not the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be br br the animation quality is average but the dialog is quite compelling as is the story line plot sub plot and amazing creativity i found within this production i will <UNK> from <UNK> the plot as it has been done and done but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy br br this is in my opinion the best disney animated feature length film br br it rates a 9 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> the book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life but saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement the acting directing cinematography and storyline were all horrible i would never recommend this movie to anyone i've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie i did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly but they have left out too many key <UNK> of the book the movie tried but failed to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only <UNK> the central theme of the prophecy while putting myself in the position who had not read the book i saw the <UNK> prophecy as a bunch of <UNK> b s i am thoroughly disappointed with <UNK> for the way this movie turned out
<START> the concept of this made for tv horror movie is ludicrous beyond words but hey it was the late 1970's and literally all stupid horror <UNK> were pretty damn <UNK> so why not exploit the idea of a <UNK> possessed dog the plot of devil dog is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of the omen and replace the <UNK> baby boy with a nest of german shepard <UNK> seriously i'm not kidding that's what the movie is about during the opening sequence members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it <UNK> by satan himself you'd think that the lord of darkness has other things on his mind than to <UNK> with a german shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time but apparently not exactly like little <UNK> in the omen one of the <UNK> is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal but lucky  that's the <UNK> name  is pure evil and <UNK> annoying neighbors and <UNK> school teachers in derivative and <UNK> executed ways he also <UNK> his <UNK> character on the family wife and children but he cannot force the father richard crenna to stick his arm into a <UNK> because he's a chosen one the whole thing becomes too moronic for words when crenna eventually travels to <UNK> to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old <UNK> who speaks perfect english i guess he learned that living in isolation <UNK> of a mountain his entire life director curtis <UNK> what's the matter with helen ruby and lead actor richard crenna wait until dark the evil desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere but all is in vain scenes like cute puppy eyes <UNK> setting fire to a spanish maid or a dog <UNK> bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of <UNK> and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that the special effects are pathetic especially near the end when the satan dog <UNK> into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall devil dog is a truly dumb movie but it's definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of <UNK> there are entertaining brief cameos of <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> and sister hyde as the terrifying cult queen and r g armstrong the car the pack as the evil fruit <UNK> and puppy salesman and yes that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her ice cream in carpenter's assault on <UNK> 13
<START> first of all there wasn't really anything in this movie that grabbed me really it wasn't a bad movie just another movie where i said well that wasn't anything special after i'd seen it there was probably drama and stuff but it simply didn't grab me but more <UNK> semi dull as i said in the <UNK> it <UNK> very cheap in a way the quality of the film itself the images <UNK> like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap made for tv movie than a well respected english film maker the camera angles and shots were very amateur like in my opinion didn't really have any close up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes i haven't seen many english films and the ones i've seen didn't really impress me more than this and they <UNK> kind of similar done with the camera work colors and such game tried to be more cool hip smart see my review of lola <UNK> about this if you wish but didn't succeed for me either overall just a little indifferent movie that wasn't anything special at best i'm afraid and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted
<START> the title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but i would like to welcome alone in the dark to the short list of real candidates plan 9 from outer space battlefield earth and the adventures of <UNK> <UNK> br br as i watched the 90 minute bore i found it difficult to even stay awake even while i was trying so hard to laugh at the film but alas i felt alone in the dark i was gonna try to avoid the pun but i couldn't resist as i looked around hoping to see mike nelson and his two robot friends alas my friends and i had to provide comedy throughout the film br br so about the film itself lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film the film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the <UNK> in aliens they even call them <UNK> and the creatures in pitch black the can turn invisible at random and i assure you it is random and get hurt by light also present are small <UNK> creatures used to control humans that <UNK> them into something resembling a zombie all of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997 the action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow people shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your <UNK> burn from <UNK> while bad rock music <UNK> in the background br br and those were the high points the story revolving around a <UNK> investigator slater whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> coat and not <UNK> for 2 days an <UNK> reid who is rather inept and a government agent <UNK> whose lines involve <UNK> order all three should be ashamed at their performances not that they have really ever done a good a job before and the casting director should be ashamed reid and slater are supposed to be lovers in the film i guess the film contains the single most awkward love scene i have ever seen on film between the two br br then comes the plot quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all the rest is illogical at best the plot holes could contain the collective <UNK> of all three stars the film begins with text and a voice explaining the back story this opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible this opening narration is later repeated <UNK> in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film and the ending did not make one ounce of sense not only did it not make sense in the world of the film it simply did not make sense br br finally the direction of one uwe boll disgrace thats all that can be said his use of shaking the camera to <UNK> suspense his lack of direction with the actors just watch reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot the complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects and finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers br br i <UNK> a 1 50 to see this show at a second run theater and while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter i would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one br br shame on you uwe boll shame on you tara reid shame on you christian slater shame on you stephen <UNK> shame on anyone who was associated with this film
<START> i think the reason for all the <UNK> <UNK> on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating <UNK> and discussing their first <UNK> but to see someone post <UNK> getting <UNK> pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle let's face it she looks good she's light years <UNK> than my mother who's the same age it's not an oscar or a cult classic like the first but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect a cinematic experience that will touch your soul as such it never claims to be either it's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling and is a <UNK> of a brilliant character that we all love to hate it's the character of catherine <UNK> that helped give way for this sequel fans of the first movie want to see more of that <UNK> ice queen br br the cinematography and art direction were lush and <UNK> and made me want to move to <UNK> for sure the score is amazing as well br br sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from david <UNK> who's virtually unknown br br there's a <UNK> in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only <UNK> in a psychiatrist in place of the cop as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty pleasure <UNK> that the story is known for br br at the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it and that's the movie's only intentions so if you've got <UNK> with <UNK> stone maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you <UNK> forth your <UNK> vomit
<START> i am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one or vice versa being that it is nearly fifteen years since i saw this film the fact that i remember so little about it does not <UNK> well perhaps it is simply because i only watched it once or twice but i doubt it if there was anything worth remembering about this film you can rest assured i would remember it br br at the time this film was released the franchise was still entering its dying phase so a lot of media coverage was <UNK> to it it's never a good sign when <UNK> pop magazines contain explanations of the plot <UNK> one such article had to explain that freddy was left too weak to <UNK> the dreams of grown humans so he decides to go after <UNK> unborn son so far so good but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience it should not be left to some unrelated <UNK> br br making use of the trivia given in part three about freddy's conception one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the horror for <UNK> category but alas that was not to be it goes to show the sheer idiocy of the american ratings system that a piece of <UNK> <UNK> garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original br br by this time the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it lisa <UNK> was there to provide a <UNK> of competent acting or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast either way given that her last role was in something called the all new adventures of <UNK> blade i doubt she really had anything else going for her even poor old robert englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years br br given that box office returns were in a steady decline and not just for this franchise at the time one would have thought that the studios would realize <UNK> their films does not make them more <UNK> in fact this particular film like its immediate predecessor was so <UNK> that not only did it fail to attract a new audience both succeeded in <UNK> the core audience that originally supported the franchise despite this part five must be given some credit for not having the bright <UNK> feeling that made part four so insulting to look at br br i gave a nightmare on elm street part five a one out of ten by trying to appeal to everyone or the <UNK> idea of everyone it succeeds in appealing to <UNK> like parts two and four one could <UNK> it from the continuity entirely and nobody would notice the difference
<START> there are a number of problems with this movie but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little the base story is quite good but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice the non existent budget really killed this movie stuart gordon the writer director has writing credit on <UNK> i <UNK> the kids' which was a box office smash however that movie had some serious cash backing from disney honestly this is a good example of when to not make a movie had he waited a few more years technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects not to mention he could have found a company with money
<START> a horror movie is being shot and things aren't going well it's about a masked killer the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew he goes crazy and kills two people he's killed himself and the film is never finished twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it but there's a curse people who try and finish it are killed themselves the students ignore that guess what happens next br br the plot is old hat but this isn't bad for what it is a low budget slasher film it's well made with a young and fairly talented young cast no one is great but no one is terrible either it also avoids the obligatory and needless female nude scenes it moves quickly the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't insult your intelligence also molly <UNK> is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress br br no great shakes but not bad at all i give it a 7
<START> i have no idea as to which audience director george <UNK> hoped to sell this comedy of <UNK> with <UNK> foxx in the central role and enough <UNK> outfits and <UNK> to carpet the entire 1970s norman plays like a <UNK> picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic <UNK> not to mention an <UNK> cameo by <UNK> flowers based on a play by sam <UNK> and ron clark this tale of an estranged married couple foxx and pearl <UNK> learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay and living with a <UNK> <UNK> white homosexual has enough limp <UNK> jokes to shame any early episode of <UNK> company <UNK> keeps her dignity and <UNK> sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles but the rest of the performers are <UNK> from
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i have seen i watched it on dvd and the disc does not have any special features or even a menu but that is not necessarily what i care about br br i tend to judge movies on a case by case basis depending on among other things if it is a big studio production or a smaller film this is a smaller film and i am willing to forgive minor things that said i believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that i have seen br br i enjoyed the acting of all of the major players i especially enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> and alan arkin alan arkin has most of the funniest lines the character portrayed by claire <UNK> might come across as unrealistic to some people but i have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does that helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the <UNK> of her humor br br this is not a movie for children obviously but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity there is quite a bit of adult language though but it can sometimes be very funny in particular alan <UNK> character who can't even swear correctly br br also watch for the cameos from known character actors
<START> <UNK> really bad for <UNK> first <UNK> of <UNK> but the ending was really really shocking to everyone in <UNK> the ones who were watching at home br br first match <UNK> flair vs edge w <UNK> for the wwe <UNK> championship not a bad opener these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match flair wins by <UNK> after edge <UNK> him with his <UNK> <UNK> 3 10 second match <UNK> <UNK> vs <UNK> james for the wwe women's championship not bad <UNK> the fact that this is the first time these <UNK> faced off in the ring together <UNK> goes for a <UNK> chick kick but <UNK> <UNK> nails her own chick kick for the win to retain her title 3 10 third match triple h vs big show seriously good this match was really the whole match <UNK> focuses on big show's injured arm but big show still fights back later <UNK> is able to <UNK> down big show nails a <UNK> for the win 5 10 fourth match <UNK> benjamin w mama vs <UNK> this was a bonus match not that bad it was alright after <UNK> was down behind the <UNK> <UNK> mama got a purse which had <UNK> in it <UNK> <UNK> on the head with it three times <UNK> got up only to get caught with a spinning <UNK> kick by benjamin for the win against the big man 4 10 br br fifth match jerry 'the <UNK> <UNK> vs gregory <UNK> boring slow sloppy both men didn't really put a very good effort jerry <UNK> wins after a fist drop for the win 2 10 br br sixth match <UNK> wilson vs victoria vs ashley vs maria vs <UNK> michelle in a first ever women's <UNK> match it was pretty entertaining to me ashley i think <UNK> <UNK> last to win the first ever women's <UNK> match 5 10 seventh match john cena vs chris masters vs carlito vs shawn michaels vs kane vs kurt angle w <UNK> in an <UNK> chamber match for the wwe championship it was a cool <UNK> chamber match but nothing will top last year's <UNK> chamber which was the best the last three are masters cena carlito carlito turns his back on masters gets a roll up on him to eliminate him seconds later cena gets a roll up on carlito for the three count to win the <UNK> chamber retain his wwe title but his night was not over yet 7 10 after the match vince <UNK> comes out <UNK> cena for his victory vince <UNK> states that his night is not over yet says that edge <UNK> in his money in the bank opportunity to challenge cena for the title edge comes out with <UNK> gives the <UNK> to vince heads off in the ring as cena has one more match to go here tonight br br eight match john cena vs edge w <UNK> for the wwe championship cena who is <UNK> open during the chamber match gets <UNK> straight away by edge edge then nails a <UNK> on cena goes for the cover to his shock cena breaks out edge nails another <UNK> covers for the shocking three count as he has beat cena has won the wwe championship for the first time in his career 1 10 so last year's new years revolution was better than this year's but it was still alright the <UNK> match was also good the shocking of edge <UNK> in his <UNK> opportunity is definitely the most <UNK> on the <UNK> show br br overall i'll give it 7 10 a c
<START> i liked this movie a lot it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things other than that it was great
<START> <UNK> follows a project <UNK> new york high school girl from a sense of <UNK> into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self <UNK> purpose and much more although the film is not about boxing boxing is all about the film so much so you can almost smell the sweat technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it <UNK> is no chick flick and no rocky it is rather a very human drama which even viewers who don't know boxing will be able to connect with
<START> this became a cult movie in chinese college students though i <UNK> watched it until it is <UNK> in <UNK> uk br br full of arty <UNK> <UNK> the plot is mediocre and unreal the <UNK> it wants to convey is how independent artists <UNK> the <UNK> of music <UNK> and maintain <UNK> <UNK> of an artistic <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> themselves for dirty <UNK> that is really <UNK> and superficial the <UNK> are mainly pathetic acting is poor <UNK> is full of art <UNK> it is a fantasy movie for kids and that s all br br
<START> did anybody succeed in getting in this movie br br it's a total mess to me a vague historical sentimental context instead of a plot a pretentious imagery as <UNK> en scene and it lasts two hours br br shame on those who wasted money here
<START> kudos to fawcett to taking on roles that at the time were considered controversial to my <UNK> rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980's and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that time br br fawcett is simply a woman who is followed then stalked by actor james russo he is adequate as the obsessed psychopath but at times a bit transparent br br diana <UNK> has a bit role as does <UNK> <UNK> as the house mate <UNK> <UNK> about the legal consequences when fawcett the rape victim takes revenge on the <UNK> the scene where she throws a <UNK> pan of hot oil at russo is classic and as the rapist he deserves it she then keeps him in bondage and the consequences must be faced br br a very real story <UNK> the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been <UNK> physically and mentally highly recommended 8 10
<START> don't bother a little <UNK> could go a long way but all we get is pure ham particularly from <UNK> the plot is one of those <UNK> car episodes the vehicle <UNK> into another and everything changes direction again until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot gina phillips is actually good but it's hard playing across from a <UNK> <UNK> playing lady <UNK> lost in the <UNK> brother's duck soup ah the <UNK> now there's an actor and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly or dr dread who's filled with lots of <UNK> and no working <UNK> i'm one of those <UNK> who just has to see a movie to the end <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the author of numerous novels plays and short stories w <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1965 was considered among the world's great authors during his lifetime and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public published in 1944 the <UNK> edge is the tale of a world war i veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values it was <UNK> last major novel and it was immensely popular given that the <UNK> conflicts are <UNK> spiritual and philosophical issues it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version but <UNK> f <UNK> of 20th century fox fell in love with the book and <UNK> up the screen rights shortly after <UNK> br br according to film <UNK> the <UNK> edge was to be directed by the legendary george <UNK> from a screenplay by <UNK> himself and it does seem that <UNK> wrote an adaptation when the film went into production however <UNK> was replaced by edmund <UNK> a director less known for artistic touch than a <UNK> like manner and the <UNK> script was replaced with one by <UNK> <UNK> the author of such memorable screenplays as the <UNK> incident <UNK> power recently returned from military service during world war ii was cast as the <UNK> conflicted larry <UNK> gene tierney one of the great <UNK> of her era was cast as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the supporting cast was particularly notable including herbert marshall anne <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lucille watson and elsa <UNK> both budget and shooting schedule were lavish and when the film <UNK> in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike br br but time has a way of putting things into perspective seen today the <UNK> edge is indeed a beautifully produced film but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity as in most cases the major problem is the script although it is reasonably close to <UNK> novel in terms of plot it is <UNK> off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story we are told that larry is in search of enlightenment we are told that he receives it we are told he acts on it but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual artistic philosophical and intellectual <UNK> behind any of it we are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself it has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees br br we are left with the shell of <UNK> plot which centers on the relationship between larry and <UNK> a woman larry loves but leaves due to the growing <UNK> riff that opens up between them <UNK> power and gene tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support unfortunately that does not happen here they are extremely one note and power is greatly miscast to boot fortunately the supporting cast is quite good with herbert marshall <UNK> <UNK> and lucille watson particularly so the then famous performance by anne <UNK> however has not worn as well as one would hope br br with a running time of just under two and a half hours the film also feels unnecessarily long there is seemingly endless cocktail party type banter and indeed the entire india sequence which reads as <UNK> hilarious would have been better cut entirely an odd situation for this is the very sequence intended as the <UNK> of the entire film regardless of the specific scene it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point br br as for the dvd itself the film has not been <UNK> but the print is extremely good and while the bonus package isn't particularly memorable neither is <UNK> poor when all is said and done i give the <UNK> edge four stars for production values and everyone's <UNK> to take on the material but frankly this a film best left power and tierney fans who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself br br <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> it was no sense and it was so awful i think hollywood have a lot of film like that you don't have do watch it people cutter or eater what should i say it made me sick oh my god film is about people that we don't know but feed themselves with humans they have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> isn't that familiar i can bet on it you saw it in a another movie the cast was so great but i think scenario was really awful and i should say that <UNK> cooper was totally awesome he's so talented actually i said awful but i think it because of horrible scenes let me explain it did you ever eat tongue but in the film one person did it it was really awful anyway i think film would so good without that awful human eater or cutter scenes
<START> this italian film from the <UNK> is not even in the class with dog soldiers the howling or even that awful american werewolf in paris but it is fun to watch i'm talking about watching the lead actress a stunning blonde run amok in her birthday suit we're talking about graphic complete nudity it's obvious that she is a real blonde <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the story is a hoot the <UNK> are childish and the acting for the most part stinks the only redeeming value of this movie is all and there is a lot the nudity sex scenes tame by hbo standards but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night ok here's the spoiler there is no werewolf except in the opening scene of the heroine 's <UNK> the girl just <UNK> that she's a werewolf in other words a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly but it is a real <UNK> ride and if you don't look too closely it is all quite believable the kind of film that you know hollywood would have <UNK> up

<START> okay i know this <UNK> project india in a good light but the overall theme of the movie is not india it's <UNK> the power of a <UNK> and the power of a mother the relationship between <UNK> and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth then things go terribly wrong the interaction between <UNK> and her father in law the power of their dysfunctional relationship and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie shah rukh <UNK> performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of <UNK> kapoor it is easy to get caught up in the love violence and redemption of lives in this film and find yourself <UNK> a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax the musical <UNK> are strengths believable and well done
<START> anyone who has experienced the <UNK> of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet is jake a mesmerizing anthony <UNK> simply <UNK> the trauma of two <UNK> parents to an understandable image or could the creature be real writer director <UNK> ryan neatly <UNK> both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing her choice of using one setting a suburban house adds to the feeling of desperation and <UNK> br br brooke bloom and peter sean <UNK> are highly convincing as the angry but loving parents however it is the creepy minor characters mrs <UNK> barbara <UNK> an unhinged babysitter and sam stone ben <UNK> a sleazy real estate agent that <UNK> in the mind <UNK> closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell
<START> the last hunt is the forgotten hollywood classic western the theme of <UNK> via buffalo slaughter is present in other films but never so <UNK> robert <UNK> against type role as the possessed buffalo and indian killer is his finest performance br br in the 1950s your mom dropped you and your friends off at the <UNK> <UNK> usually featuring a western or comedy but it was wrong then and now to let a <UNK> watch psycho dramas like the <UNK> and the last hunt let the kids wait a few years before exposing them to films with repressed sexual <UNK> and intense racial hatred br br why did mom fail to <UNK> these films because they featured safe hollywood stars like taylor and john wayne but the climatic scene in the last hunt is as horrifying as vincent <UNK> <UNK> in the fly br br the mythology of the white buffalo part of the <UNK> of this movie was later ripped off by other movies including the white buffalo starring charles bronson as wild bill <UNK> the laugh here is that bronson used to play indians br br today a large <UNK> <UNK> herd <UNK> in <UNK> national park in <UNK> in the winter <UNK> forces <UNK> animals out of the park into montana where they are sometimes <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> indians under a us <UNK> right that pre dates the lincoln <UNK> <UNK> signed the <UNK> act which <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and started the buffalo slaughter
<START> i love the depiction of the 30s and 40s in film i love <UNK> <UNK> i was more than ready to love this picture but br br <UNK> br br no sir nothing good about this the only entertaining aspect for me was colin <UNK> character is an insecure writer and this screenplay despite <UNK> the <UNK> subject of racism approaches the audience in the fashion of an abc <UNK> special br br the only person who didn't sound like he was <UNK> was sutherland and his minutes were few br br stale approach to a tired plot
<START> losing control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world usually they involve a <UNK> route to murderous intent interspersed with <UNK> <UNK> this is not a complaint especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who <UNK> inhabit this make believe world br br kim ward <UNK> reed is suffering a bout of writer's block just by chance or is it she meets a man doug <UNK> who <UNK> with her in ever more <UNK> sexual encounters the man refuses to <UNK> any information about himself yet kim <UNK> refuses to stop the affair her agent <UNK> <UNK> scott thinks it will do wonders for her book sales as in most films of this type the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up i have seen enough of this kind of film to think no change there then but i like them they are so <UNK> br br performances of the cast <UNK> doug <UNK> carries the film as the psycho <UNK> you do not want to cross <UNK> reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril clay <UNK> as the <UNK> did not convince either br br finally a note of caution about the dvd under review both the cover and the disc state r rated and running time as <UNK> minutes but the run time is less than <UNK> minutes this probably explains why the sex scenes appear <UNK> and why jennifer <UNK> performance is cut short just as she's getting started 4 stars
<START> possibly the most brilliant thing about che part two as we begin to <UNK> it with part one in our minds is that there is no <UNK> of why che chose to <UNK> <UNK> from cuba after the revolution no <UNK> to his experience in the <UNK> no <UNK> of why he chose bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup <UNK> no <UNK> to the political decisions he made as a young man <UNK> across south america which walter <UNK> has given prominent <UNK> extraordinary focus is given to che meeting the <UNK> who <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> yet hardly any <UNK> is made to single them out as individuals to establish involved relationships he is reasonably <UNK> che drives an <UNK> <UNK> to leave no wounded man behind but there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men it is the concept br br in part 1 in cuba the rebels are welcomed by the people of the <UNK> given food and cover supported in what grows to be a <UNK> revolution here in bolivia not much understanding is apparent villagers expose him they protect government troops not his own when he <UNK> on the <UNK> of the government medical system his audience appears <UNK> you cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to <UNK> soderbergh shows u s military <UNK> working with the <UNK> but doesn't fault the united states for che's collapse che seems to have just <UNK> his fight and the place where he wanted to have it br br in <UNK> both wars soderbergh doesn't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results che's men attack and are attacked they exchange fire with <UNK> <UNK> there is generally a cut to the group in the <UNK> of combat its death <UNK> not <UNK> for this is not a war movie it is about one man's reasonably <UNK> drive to endure there is no elaborate cinematography soderbergh looks firmly at che's <UNK> dedication there are remarkable <UNK> visceral shots but being few they are all the more powerful such as che's <UNK> shot during his final beats there is an abundance of the <UNK> where these men live for weeks at a time and the all <UNK> effect is of <UNK> guevara himself having <UNK> part of the time br br <UNK> del toro one of the film's producers gives a <UNK> performance not least because it's modest he isn't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes in cuba he <UNK> in conquest in bolivia he falls to the reverse and occasionally is actually difficult to <UNK> behind a <UNK> of beard and hair del toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude you may think the film is too long i think there's a genuine cause for its <UNK> <UNK> affairs in cuba and particularly bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches but an <UNK> of staying power that might virtually be called insane in the end che as a whole or in parts is a <UNK> <UNK> movie one where its director begins by understanding the limits <UNK> in cinematic biography and working <UNK> within those means
<START> i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isn't easy and this just didn't feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didn't move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didn't score that well with them either
<START> this short spoof can be found on <UNK> millennium edition dvd of night of the living dead good thing to as i would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper in execution it's a different matter this short didn't even <UNK> a chuckle from me i really never thought i'd say this but night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating <UNK> <UNK> living dead part 2 in shocking 2 d was a very better parody and not nearly as lame or boring br br my grade f
<START> rock <UNK> roll is a messy business and dig demonstrates this masterfully a project of serious ambition and perhaps <UNK> the filmmaker is able to <UNK> together seven <UNK> years of following around two <UNK> rock groups with that said the abundance of quality material <UNK> the film's ability to <UNK> the audience if you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry this movie will undoubtedly be an <UNK> viewing the music in the film although it suffers <UNK> from requisite cutting and <UNK> is worth the price of admission alone the morning after i saw dig i went straight to the record store to pick up a brian <UNK> massacre album i was already <UNK> to the dandy <UNK> sounds primarily defined by its exploration of rock music the film succeeds at other profound levels dig is a sincere and <UNK> objective glance into the destructive and <UNK> nature of the creative process and the people that try to <UNK> those forces
<START> i liked the movie a real lot wanted to see it just for <UNK> <UNK> but the plot and story were ok too a very cool change in plot when you least expect it
<START> playwright sidney <UNK> a wonderfully over the top michael caine would kill for a hit play enter young wonder kid a solid reeve who's just written such a play <UNK> into this <UNK> overly hysterical wife superbly played by cannon and a german psychic a very funny irene worth and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick br br while not up to sleuth standards deathtrap is none the less a very capable twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by ira <UNK> the performers are obviously having a field day with the material with caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto br br the film loses a bit of steam <UNK> through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall deathtrap is solid well acted and suspenseful fun
<START> preston waters a 11 years old boy has problems with his parents and brothers specially because of money issues he is crazy to have his own house and his own rules since his brothers always stole his saved money and his parents neglect his wishes one awful day preston was riding his <UNK> it was the same day that the villain of the story <UNK> was trying to <UNK> from the police and accidentally ran the car over <UNK> bike needing to be far away from the police <UNK> gives in a hurry a check to cover the <UNK> of <UNK> bike the problem was it was a blank check preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on that check 1 million dollars all that money gives preston things that he always wished for like a mansion with pool lots of toys and even a <UNK> the problems start to begin when the fbi and <UNK> wants to know where the money is making preston in a hard situation and facing many problems br br this movie was one of my favorites during my childhood
<START> when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the <UNK> have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work <UNK> used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual <UNK> speaking of <UNK> the pace is <UNK> down and the sheer difficulty in <UNK> through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very <UNK> <UNK> experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to <UNK> using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you
<START> gwyneth paltrow is absolutely great in this movie but the story is unfortunately half baked and david <UNK> energy is sort of like cold <UNK> when he <UNK> his mouth and gets serious for a moment or two there is a rush of what might have been who thought 25 year old <UNK> would be entertaining
