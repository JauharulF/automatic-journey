<START> i walked into heart of gold thinking i was going to watch a documentary about neil young instead i witnessed a self serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby <UNK> who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots highly rated by aging baby <UNK> critics directed and performed by more aging baby <UNK> artists heart of gold is a bore fest from start to finish that is if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie neil young and crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a <UNK> chair of middle of the road mediocrity what happened to the raunchy guitar of his earlier solo efforts i guess all of his <UNK> boxes <UNK> out and his over driven <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the hot air of his generation as far as <UNK> goes this is the daring director of something wild <UNK> and howard a student filmmaker could have made a more daring film than this poorly <UNK> surface performance film don't waste your on heart of gold and go straight to the last <UNK> and shelter and if you really want to dig deep into the personality of a rock and roll icon <UNK> up a copy of chuck <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rock and roll which is sorely out of print and baby <UNK> don't bother <UNK> about how this review is jaded by someone younger i too am one of those baby <UNK> who listened to <UNK> girl on acid and <UNK> in the streets to the <UNK> street fighting man go back and watch don't look back or shelter and then come back and tell me that heart of gold has any worth as a document
<START> just got around to seeing monster man yesterday it had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up i'm glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level true you really can't expect too much from hearing the plot <UNK> but after reading some of the reviews for it i was <UNK> i mean what trash fan wouldn't want to see a gore flick about a deranged <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> people down with his make shift monster truck i went in expecting a cross between road trip and the hills have eyes and got so much more this was a horror comedy that actually worked the film makers got it right when it came to making you <UNK> and making you <UNK> with laughter at the same time kudos to michael davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the <UNK> with the humor let me list just a few reasons why i love this movie so much first off is the story it's been done to death in so many other flicks a college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married he being the 25 year old virgin that he is <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> and decides to take the road trip to confess his love hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good <UNK> hidden in the <UNK> of his station <UNK> is good buddy <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> former friend who laughs and talks just like jack black in high <UNK> you can't help but like the guy but if he was your friend in real life you'd have to keep a ball bat handy laugh all you want but have you ever been hit with one to keep him in check so he's a little on the obnoxious side to say the least but you can tell that he's a loyal friend deep down anyway they're on the road and when they stop in a bar they <UNK> the locals now they're being stalked by a <UNK> clone in a monster truck that's it yeah along the way they pick up a gorgeous <UNK> but i'm too lazy and <UNK> to go into that right now so just watch the damn movie br br second thing i love was the humor this one had some of the <UNK> laughs of any movie since cabin fever just how messed up is it well i won't even go into the whole cat scene and as for the corpse <UNK> thing i'll leave that to your virgin eyes as well the bar full of <UNK> was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like john <UNK> bothered me too <UNK> although a totally obnoxious frat boy type can really <UNK> off the one liners love the by the way i need a new pair br br the gore this one <UNK> it on heavy while the first hour plays out as a demented road comedy the last third is all about blood and guts if the movie hadn't kept such a light tone throughout it would have been a little disturbing but seeing how it was all played for laughs there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it if you're still in your seat by the time it comes you'll probably see the humor in it too but seriously there were <UNK> and <UNK> of the red stuff there was a big plot turn that i didn't see coming and when the credits rolled i was completely satisfied i had gotten exactly what i came for and i'm really glad that i bought it much like cabin fever it's going to get a lot of replay br br the look of the movie was outstanding there was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and i loved the exaggerated colors it's obvious that monster man was done on a relatively low budget but much like cabin fever sorry i keep comparing the two it actually works in the movie's favor cabin fever was an <UNK> to the 70s <UNK> this was the 80s answer to that so take that for what it's worth no cgi here this is what we all needed i'm not exactly sure why it didn't get a theatrical release because this is everything that <UNK> <UNK> should have been thank god for lions gate
<START> oz was the first original television show that hbo put onto its channel in the 1 hour <UNK> and it remains to this day the very best the story is simple oz is a surreal look into the lives of high maximum security prisoners at <UNK> primarily focusing on em city now there are many things to compliment this show on from the writing which in my opinion was the best on television when this show aired directing top notch acting best of the best and the characters this show just literally blew my <UNK> off this show was a <UNK> acclaimed gem until the sopranos <UNK> after that critics were <UNK> over that epic tale of trust and family to notice this compelling drama oz to me is a better show than sopranos overall and it's a shame that i never won any major <UNK> br br kudos to all who were involved in this magnificent gut wrenching show br br kudos
<START> back in 1994 the power rangers had become a huge franchise and t v executives at the usa network were hoping to get in on the action and came up with the <UNK> teenage alien fighters from beverly hills in which the evil <UNK> who looks like he's wearing a home made darth vader costume and his talking bird that looks like a rubber dog chew toy come to earth to <UNK> it using giant monsters that look like rejects from a 1970's godzilla film fortunately an alien that looks like a giant piece of clear <UNK> <UNK> four teenagers to defend the earth gives them each a <UNK> of a different star <UNK> that allows them to <UNK> into <UNK> up <UNK> who look like dancers from an eighties tech no music video they could also combined into a giant knight forty episodes were made the usa network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from japan like power rangers did and made up this show on their own using the budget of a 1950's scifi film the fights scenes are generic the special effects are poor and some of the sets look like they could fall down the actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham it up and <UNK> i can only imagine their shock when the show was <UNK> led
<START> i neglected this film when i used to go to the movie store but then the curiosity got to me and i decided to check it out i loved it the movie starts off with judy and jay heading for a halloween party at the abandoned funeral <UNK> <UNK> house then we meet a few more characters angela and the <UNK> <UNK> max <UNK> <UNK> and helen then of course they start to party and when really in the mood they decide to have a <UNK> which <UNK> a demon the demon possesses angela and she starts her gruesome <UNK> will they survive the night of the demons br br the movie was overall great the gore was fine but the nudity provided by <UNK> <UNK> trash from <UNK> once again <UNK> it i never was a fan of hers and never will be
<START> mario van <UNK> tries to go the jean claude van damme route and play a <UNK> robotic soldier who goes <UNK> to <UNK> himself however the government isn't going to take this lying down so among the simplistic plot van <UNK> <UNK> villagers from the rebel forces and <UNK> a improved version of himself in this disappointing film this blatant rip off of universal soldier which is far more fun then this simply goes nowhere the main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably <UNK> van <UNK> just waits around and there just isn't enough ass kicking to justify a viewing on the other hand the movie does sort of resemble a competent version of r o t o r although where as that abysmal bad movie was hilarious this one only <UNK> occasional laughter in its laughably unconvincing action sequences also like r o t o r it makes no sense in its narrative and basically the movie is <UNK> boring plus the villains are <UNK> weak and basically the movie needs an actual action scenario to work because the material is too dull in all regards solo is a very weak film br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> steve smith has finally run a fairly weak series right into the ground with this movie poor actors <UNK> a horrible script pretty much sums this one up two hours of your life you'll never get back go get a root <UNK> instead you'll enjoy it more
<START> no matter how many times <UNK> <UNK> tries to get road runner we always know what's going to happen though our sympathy always remains with the highlight in hook line and stinker is a <UNK> goldberg style scheme that hopes will finally finish off <UNK> but of course you know what happens br br so <UNK> e continues hilarious engaging in <UNK> defined by george as your effort after you've forgotten your aim while road runner pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger or lack thereof in which he could find himself a real classic br br and yes the middle name is i learned that from <UNK>
<START> well i watch tons of movies and this one really sucked big time i am sure we are all sick and tired of the low budget <UNK> to make vampire movies using some martial arts teacher turn actor type of movies i am also so tired of the guy knowing some form of fighting technique and then able to fight his way through a somewhat boring movie i forced myself to watch it and one of the main reasons were that the lead actress is quite pretty ha ha well i hope this helped a bit and if you have time and want to give your brain a rest watch it well hopefully one day this type of movies will not be released but then hey where will all the low budget actors go br br the movie also contains many but that i will leave to you to find because it adds quite a bit of fun while watching and also if you a bit of a <UNK> it will bother you cheers
<START> this movie tells about the real life story of <UNK> who lived for 27 years lying in bed after having broken his neck and fights a battle to get legal <UNK> for someone that can <UNK> with his death br br <UNK> <UNK> is one of best actors of his generation consider this he has to carry this movie with only his face unbelievable that he didn't even got an oscar nomination now we can all see that the academy is a joke the supporting cast was terrific the optimistic <UNK> his lawyer julia the rest of the family each and everyone has his her own opinion about the fact that <UNK> wants to die br br whether your for or against <UNK> put your opinions aside because this movie deserves to be seen by people all over the world half way through the movie i started crying and it didn't stop until the credits rolled this movie is so heartbreaking but also wonderful to watch and i can't wait to see it again i give it a 9 10 and in my opinion it is by far the best film of the year so far
<START> <UNK> open your eyes and the others were proof of <UNK> talent and skill as a filmmaker but in my humble opinion were also flawed films in their attempt to <UNK> the audience always offering one turn of the screw too many <UNK> cheap thrills twists and turns over depth and <UNK> lucky for everyone <UNK> chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending focusing on characters and the emotional ties that <UNK> them br br the result is a little miracle of a film beautifully written photographed scored acted and directed everyone involved in this film delivers a <UNK> high performance behind and in front of the cameras from the wonderful cast <UNK> shines but mabel <UNK> clara and lola give the film an amazing authenticity to exquisite <UNK> br br the film <UNK> on many relevant issues and emotions effectively it <UNK> heart and mind with equal power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits roll this is a brilliantly executed film that not only will stand as a landmark in spanish cinema but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens in the abroad <UNK> classics has paid a record 6 million dollars to <UNK> it don't be surprised it it manages to get in the oscar race there's no stopping <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> this film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be the director does an excellent job of riding the line between emotional and physical violence but in the end he remembers what so many indie films forget he tells a good story when watching this film i was reminded of how <UNK> and mundane most big budget hollywood films really have become br br especially notable is an exceptionally strong performance by the film's lead <UNK> <UNK> as an villainous thug on his way to the top of the crime heap <UNK> plays a conniving brutal <UNK> <UNK> and sleazy s o b but he is so likable that he keeps you entertained the whole time br br i read somewhere that these guys were part of the new wave of latino filmmakers in los angeles called la or something like that either way this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their work br br
<START> this picture was released in may of 1979 starring playboy <UNK> susan as honey <UNK> playboy <UNK> lisa london as o'hara and playboy <UNK> pamela jean <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> in one of the most delicious <UNK> comedies in drive in history a <UNK> of <UNK> young <UNK> all come together in a tale of battling <UNK> sisters who will stop at nothing to bare everything so what does h o t s really stand for you're going to have to watch the movie to get the answer you see the girls are having there problems with the society girls on campus that make them out to be nothing but sex <UNK> <UNK> therefore the girls set out to <UNK> the society girls no matter what they have to do to get the job done in addition cut up in this mess is the dean of the college who wants to <UNK> the group of girls before they grow out of control i loved this movie especially lisa london i thought her acting was fantastic and i'm disappointed that she didn't get other acting jobs based on the three <UNK> alone i give this movie 10 <UNK> stars
<START> nights in brings back to the screen two talented actors in diane lane and richard gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present the chemistry between lane and gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace the locations beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet and the story that follows and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care james franco in another <UNK> role is just the right casting and the <UNK> of lane in combination with the beach house is a true fall 2008 film to remember forever as was the <UNK>
<START> 25 sitcoms had big screen spin offs most of these came in the 1970's here is a list of all are you being served <UNK> bless this house bottom <UNK> army father dear father for the love of <UNK> george and mildred the league of gentlemen love <UNK> <UNK> the lovers man about the house nearest and <UNK> never mind the quality feel the <UNK> on the <UNK> 3 please sir <UNK> rising <UNK> <UNK> and son 2 that's your funeral till death us do part 2 up 3 <UNK> o whatever happened to the likely <UNK> and <UNK> apocalypse br br so there was a big screen spin off of my all time favourite sitcom <UNK> army what the film focused on was when the men were <UNK> it showed the difficulties of getting a uniform and getting weapons it was a big summary of the first series of <UNK> army at the end of the film they catch some german spies in the church the home guard come dressed as alter <UNK> and had <UNK> with them and defeated the germans the best bit in the film was when they were showing a <UNK> lecture and a german lecture at the same time german head office on the phone would you get 10 000 bombs cut to home guard <UNK> mrs on the phone would you get 1 of <UNK> <UNK> br br this was probably the second best sitcom spin off movie beaten only by till death us do part 1969 it would have been better if at the start of the movie it had already been formed it was half way through the war though still an excellent movie a good one for the family
<START> was very fortunate to see the movie <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> international film festival it was the opening night and was such a delightful movie it was shot beautifully around india and i want to go there now the main actor <UNK> was absolutely incredible he was the highlight of the movie apparently he was also in the movie <UNK> wedding he was the total star of the show character <UNK> me up was very funny and the girl forget the name was great too they were all great there were many tremendous scenes like the one with the monkeys and basically i just loved the movie everyone walking out was raving about it and it was certainly a high point of the film festival was my favorite from the festival it really beautifully captured the <UNK> of india and can't believe how beautiful india is the feeling upon walking out of the cinema was a real high it is a delightful happy film i loved it
<START> i have always been a fan of bottom grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states the chemistry between and is always genius and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail i thus sat down to watch this movie with great <UNK> and was utterly disappointed by the end br br the first 3 4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed sorry but with some utterly brilliant moments unfortunately these laugh out loud moments make you realize how less than brilliant the rest of the movie is the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous br br the end of the movie the scenes for those of you who've seen it was perhaps the worst ending i've seen in the past decade honestly it was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didn't bother me and wasn't funny which did br br to sum up i was sorely disappointed by this movie i shall <UNK> to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the memories that i can but i have to warn you if you're about to for your <UNK> <UNK> tape from the local don't there are far better things to spend your money on
<START> totally un funny jokes that fall flat amateurish acting with one or two exceptions boring characters and dialogue that's at best mediocre after watching this movie one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think i must make this film no wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release
<START> you'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible tv movie this movie is an exercise in over acting very bad over acting to situations that made out to be more than what they are i won't give away the plot but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back the only plus is seeing <UNK> brady running around in a bikini
<START> this small john ford western with no <UNK> but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces it has a documentary like feel to it as it <UNK> the journey west of a party of <UNK> and it may be the most authentic looking of all ford's films it's on par with the sun shines bright which he made a couple of years later br br there is a plot of sorts a group of bank robbers join the <UNK> train at one point but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental the splendid performances of ford's stock company ben johnson harry carey jr ward bond jane <UNK> etc adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full <UNK> star performance is <UNK> <UNK> denver <UNK> was a much <UNK> actress than she was ever given credit for as were bond and johnson who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an oscar for his work in the last picture show as he said himself <UNK> couldn't have happened to a <UNK> add bert superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of <UNK> that couldn't have some from anyone other than ford this is a film that truly <UNK> america's <UNK> and is full of sentiment and feeling
<START> this documentary attempts comedy but never quite gets there for me camp maybe the more apt word that everyone will agree on and have a hard time avoiding in any review is <UNK> it <UNK> <UNK> it was as if the film makers had worried their viewers would take the movie too seriously and so they bent over backwards to insert <UNK> and <UNK> we're joking around here see br br in short i felt it was trying too hard for example the <UNK> puppets that introduced each scene were to me annoying when i'm sure they were meant to be amusing or at least <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br do not however avoid this movie based on my complaints just be ready to <UNK> in <UNK> rather than having it thrust at you <UNK> if you're interested in lighthearted fare you could do far far worse at the very least the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the <UNK> make this interesting and worth a view at best of like minded <UNK> lovers will hoot and <UNK> over choice bits throughout the film
<START> saturday afternoon is one of harry <UNK> best known short subjects and with good reason it is one of his funniest and best films the plot such as it is is an old <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> husband <UNK> away for a night out with a his pal and a couple of other girls it's a solid and well used comedy plot but the difference here is harry <UNK> himself his slow <UNK> <UNK> innocent character has somehow <UNK> his way into a marriage with a woman who feels that he of all people must be ruled with an iron fist and he is only thrust into cheating on her because he can't say no to the of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the cute <UNK> of the girl br br it's a very adult problem to be thrust onto such a helpless <UNK> character harry doesn't want to cheat but he can't do anything about it in a wonderful bit of comic business he can't bring himself to blow the new girlfriend kiss goodbye he <UNK> pushes the kiss at her <UNK> and <UNK> off his hand as if to <UNK> it the film is a three reel comedy ten minutes longer than the two <UNK> harry <UNK> had previously been starring in for mack <UNK> with no more plot perhaps it was even designed to be a two <UNK> this works beautifully since it gives him as much time as he needs to <UNK> the slow reactions and <UNK> glimpses and half actions where so much of his comedy lives br br he's at his best here and the show is really harry <UNK> curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing his little half smiles his look while handling the money he has hidden under the <UNK> <UNK> attempts to enter the fight at the end i think his comedy makes us recognize something <UNK> innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us yet at the same time by allowing us to understand what harry does not such as the fact that the women he good <UNK> brings to his friend to cheer him after he thinks the date has been blown are in fact <UNK> he forces his to realize with a little bit of sadness that we are not that innocent anymore his comedy is just as capable of making us <UNK> say <UNK> as it is making us laugh often at once br br here harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife he wants to tell his wife whose boss and take some power back in his relationship he wants to fight back against the two violent men at the end of the film but he just can't affect his surroundings that much and sometimes we all feel like that br br the film is perfectly directed by frequent <UNK> director harry <UNK> it moves at a quick pace and never <UNK> while at the same time making time for and presenting to best effect harry <UNK> still <UNK> comedy <UNK> <UNK> a frequent foil to <UNK> plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his very effective pairing with harry the gags <UNK> out in a way that gives maximum effect too and harry gets his own version of a lloyd or keaton style stunt at the end here the comedy is not in harry's big reactions to the danger of sitting <UNK> between two moving cars but in his <UNK> to take it in br br this is a hilarious film and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique an talented <UNK> that i know ever to have existed
<START> all boris karloff fans will love this classic film where karloff is the castle <UNK> and gives his patients excellent attention sir ronald burton richard greene an <UNK> century english <UNK> believes his two friends have been murdered by count von bruno stephen <UNK> on his black forest estate arriving at von <UNK> castle to <UNK> evidence burton learns von <UNK> unhappy wife <UNK> paula and dr boris karloff the castle <UNK> are virtual prisoners <UNK> <UNK> motives von bruno and <UNK> <UNK> jr a giant mute <UNK> henchman discover the <UNK> was responsible for their being captured and tortured you will definitely have to view this great classic karloff film to enjoy the ending
<START> <UNK> is an extraordinary film that towers above most film production its refreshing witty humor is never an excuse to remain superficial to the contrary the film explores <UNK> of the human spirit and human relations its warm approach <UNK> tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of that which <UNK> all people the characters are charming and amusing <UNK> those <UNK> that we can all laugh about in ourselves the quick dialog and witty banter will keep you on your <UNK> and you may find yourself trying to contain your own laughter as you won't want to miss a single phrase you'll probably want to see it in the cinema and then again over several more times on video and each time you will discover something new after each viewing you are sure to feel warm and <UNK>
<START> while possibly the stupidest most tasteless and violent slapstick comedy ever made guest house is also a very funny one don't listen to the critics they have no sense of humour while the climax runs out of steam but not vomit it's still a funny party movie seven <UNK> in the eye out of ten
<START> having had a great grandfather be captured and sent to during world war two i was <UNK> to watch this when it was first screened on tv my great grandfather kept a diary whilst he was in <UNK> and when he died over there his mates bought it back and i have been lucky enough to read it and feel i have at least some idea of what was really like first hand br br this is a fantastic <UNK> of what happened to those poor <UNK> who were sent to prison and shows what <UNK> and cruelty they witnessed in order to protect their country it is a terrific story of commitment and aussie spirit that never going to give up attitude it is worth watching if you like australian history or anything to do with world war two br br i enjoyed this mini very much and give it 10 out of 10
<START> this movie had a lot of ups downs the storyline is strong while telling the saga of barker growing up then her <UNK> with her boys and the fbi <UNK> russell is very talented and her beauty even shines through as barker in public enemies the direction of mark l lester while not as good as in <UNK> was still very interesting br br eric roberts plays a short lived part as a security guard turned thug and lover and <UNK> <UNK> plays a prostitute who hangs with the gang frank stallone plays a thug who helps out the gang while one of his exploits gets one of boy into trouble he gets himself out in a final way so to speak br br i was <UNK> intrigued captivated throughout this movie so it makes me wonder what movie all these others who voted it so low watched for all those wondering <UNK> the fbi was actually that bad in the beginning didn't have tommy guns like the <UNK> had were thus at quite a <UNK> whenever they did get into with <UNK> of that era since everything i saw represented the 30's i felt it was more realistic than many other movies made portraying that era it is in may ways like a train wreck happening you don't want to watch but just have too enjoy
<START> the tender hook or who killed the australian film industry case no <UNK> this sorry excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential  rose <UNK> pia miranda hugo <UNK> in a jazz era gangster drama  and turns it into a <UNK> paced and executed <UNK> <UNK> is a boxing <UNK> and gangster and <UNK> illiterate for no apparent reason he's given to singing bob dylan and leonard cohen songs before <UNK> how post modern how stupid anyway there's a boxer art matthew le who becomes latest <UNK> over his unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> luke <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes the goo goo eyes at him sexual tension under the surface miranda plays daisy a friend of these flower girls stick together who keeps turning up in scenes <UNK> they practice dancing together and talk about <UNK> up with guys in the 1920s i stopped counting <UNK> after that there's a subplot involving japanese beer and a <UNK> of <UNK> pearl <UNK> i don't know what it was all about for some reason that is not exactly at all explained <UNK> puts cocaine in <UNK> <UNK> thinks he's a drunk and <UNK> him <UNK> plots and schemes to help him out again she's a big one for the plotting and scheming most of which causes trouble two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> and russian <UNK> tyler debate <UNK> off when he realises their part in one of schemes but <UNK> <UNK> out when he sees crying a lot of practically incoherent scenes get in the road of the film finally ending br br director jonathan spends a lot of time working with cinematographer geoffrey simpson creating some pretty images but utterly fails to generate a sense of style which might have <UNK> for and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> script unfortunately sense of film <UNK> the lack of <UNK> of the scenes and exposition is stunningly incompetent in an early scene daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists how she got there and indeed who she is seems to have slipped mind there are many more examples of this <UNK> where he chases poetic he achieves only wan <UNK> he <UNK> awkward performances from actors who are normally reliable badly <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> on <UNK> ability to project a kind of haunted doll like humanity whilst <UNK> her with an incomprehensible character br br it might not matter so much if the story had more substantial characters and stronger plotting preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir films and <UNK> with <UNK> pop culture quotes but it doesn't it's boring
<START> i really enjoy this film it is a look back in time when this nation was truly at risk from nations who either attacked or war on us i e the japanese and germans robert <UNK> and lane were excellent in the lead roles the supporting cast otto <UNK> alan <UNK> and norman lloyd were also outstanding the direction pace and finale held and continue to hold my interest so much so that i bought my own copy thank goodness for turner classic movies they show so many of the truly classic films including this one br br robert <UNK> was certainly no light weight as an actor and although i am a great fan of gary cooper and joel <UNK> two of my favorite actors who were first offered the lead role i don't see what they would have brought to the role that would have <UNK> bob performance br br this is a film that i enjoy watching and urge others to view
<START> in this horrible attempt at a blair witch <UNK> a bunch of people go to africa to investigate a creature called the half <UNK> it's pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of and that everything was improvised that can work if you have good actors which this film didn't br br this movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture as a result there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do quirky african stuff like eating elephant dung there is also some pretty good footage of lions eating from a national <UNK> perspective but there's not a single scare in the whole movie br br if you've seen cannibal holocaust or the blair witch project this movie will hold no surprises for you and you can probably watch better lion footage on the discovery channel br br definitely a half effort br br a note to the filmmakers guys do us all a favor and next time save the how i spent my african vacation home movie for your family and close friends nobody else wants to see it
<START> from all the rave reviews we couldn't wait to see this show we love wacky humor and creative material especially from australia and new zealand br br i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes but we just couldn't bear any more misery it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever experienced watching a tv show it felt like 15 hours the songs may be mildly interesting by themselves but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn't work br br we're trying hard now to <UNK> the memory if you want some wonderful down under humor in a delightful and engaging film see the dish instead
<START> two people living in the same flat complex find their partners are having an affair with each other as they try and piece together how it happened they also <UNK> on an emotional journey that for a br br building on his previous success with happy together and <UNK> express wong <UNK> <UNK> gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of <UNK> passions yearning and <UNK> love br br possibly in the mood for love is not to everyone's taste it wanders in rather <UNK> at not particularly long for a film but it appears longer because not a lot really happens but this lazy feel <UNK> a quite tightly constructed film most of the story is <UNK> woven around a series of set piece role plays where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective <UNK> trying to work out how the affair started i say cunning because of course this makes it difficult for the audience and the characters to tell what is in role and what is genuine br br if all this sounds rather arty and self conscience that's because it is <UNK> so and it is played to perfection by two of hong <UNK> finest maggie cheung and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with some excellent support from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and rebecca pan br br it is also a <UNK> performance by wong <UNK> <UNK> who treats the audience to a <UNK> and sensual <UNK> bringing together christopher doyle who later <UNK> his lush over <UNK> style on hero and pin bing lee whose beautifully understated style can be seen on <UNK> in a small town was cinematographic genius it has all the bold beauty of doyle without frankly the <UNK> poster cheesiness of his work on hero the music as always with wong is prominent from <UNK> king cole singing in spanish to the haunting strings of the main theme it perfectly matches the <UNK> beauty of the images br br all in all a top film whether judged on plot acting cinematography or soundtrack similar to but more accessible than <UNK> <UNK> wings of desire this is a beautiful old fashioned story about love lost and <UNK> br br and watch out for tony <UNK> hotel room <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> recent film of the same name
<START> a brief history of time is not only a documentary on the beginning and the ending of the universal and reality as we know it this is a story about the man and the genius known as stephen <UNK> it is his story that reflects the story of time and change throughout the history of the universal the style of the documentary editing style of the interviews begin and end with a quick fade to black almost like <UNK> in between segments and interviews the documentary gives you an odd feeling like this is the view point of stephen <UNK> and not the eye of the camera the running time is only a little longer than an hour it is a short story then again its subject matter could be talked about for days and days an interesting and proud story
<START> to be fair it has been several years since i watched the <UNK> committed to celluloid known as here on earth so forgive me if my memory of the film is a little <UNK> i'll stick with the main points which plague the soul of the unfortunate viewer br br scene one chris <UNK> after having been thrown out of <UNK> school because he looks like a <UNK> year old yes very believable gives what i assume is his <UNK> speech to a field let me repeat that for you a field i think we're supposed to be moved by the combination of shame and <UNK> he is failing to express <UNK> has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard <UNK> he is a decent looking piece of cardboard but little more br br scene two after some <UNK> and teenage <UNK> <UNK> chris <UNK> and josh <UNK> do some damage to the local diner of which he is forced to <UNK> of course because who better to help with construction than some random moron who crashed into it burned it in the first place better yet let's have said random moron move in on josh <UNK> girl miss the girl he <UNK> for her equally wooden line delivery br br scene three chris <UNK> character is making out with <UNK> character and decides to name her various body parts after the states on the eastern <UNK> my soul <UNK> really how can this scenario turn out well surely you must alienate several million people if you imply their home is equivalent to miss more <UNK> feminine areas secondly <UNK> her breasts after new york and new jersey <UNK> some confusion as to whether miss is actually <UNK> <UNK> br br scene four <UNK> is running she falls down this gives her <UNK> cancer we always knew it could come back her father says right <UNK> cancer from <UNK> perhaps i missed something as i said it's been a few years surely i missed something didn't i for the love of god please tell me the girl did not contract <UNK> cancer from falling down br br that scream you just heard was my soul dying
<START> this movie basically uses <UNK> rape as one of its main comedic devices now i turned it off at the point when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her but i cannot really imagine how that was eventually turned around into something endearing and funny this movie not only <UNK> a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic how so many people seem to find it a sweet family flick is beyond me i sure enjoyed <UNK> those last night is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she will eventually learn to like it watching a <UNK> tom jerk off is not family fun i honestly feel worse off for having watched half of this creepy comedy and am totally <UNK> by these positive reviews
<START> this was a very nice soft core movie for both men and women plenty of nudity sex but without the overall <UNK> you'll usually find they could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning trust me guys if you want to get your woman in the mood get something with bobby <UNK> in it and i'm sure lovely <UNK> parent samantha <UNK> and the rest of the ladies would do it for any <UNK> male unfortunately bobby and <UNK> do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do please <UNK> me i'd love to know the photography was much better than usual so was the story predictable but nice sweet natured and romantic at the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts i give this 7 10
<START> truly appalling waste of space me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end and i can count the films i have switched off before the end on one hand br br the script and direction are <UNK> and deeply uninspiring i wouldn't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983 for example the irritating threatening the real estate guy from his house phone i mean seriously the police would be beating his door down in minutes the scenes and events just wash by you like <UNK> in a river it is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film the narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters oh and what characters they are the protagonist played by rourke is dreadful he could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed after 60 or so minutes of the film i had built absolutely zero <UNK> to this character he is neither sympathetic nor hateful just a <UNK> <UNK> from a shop window <UNK> through every single scene his motivation is impossible to <UNK> from his generally <UNK> and <UNK> delivery is he happy is he sad angry no idea just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a <UNK> <UNK> of flesh and the native american theme is just awful and pointless br br the good guys are at best unlikeable a dull white collar stereotype and a <UNK> neurotic ex wife stereotype cue <UNK> wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you aren't going to shoot me that is both <UNK> unoriginal and annoying br br the <UNK> <UNK> character seems interesting at first but soon <UNK> into an irritating one sided psycho character which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated br br <UNK> character starts with some promise but soon <UNK> into a sickening and <UNK> parody of the gangsters chick scenes from jackie brown you really want me to believe her character was so attracted to <UNK> or worse she is just a <UNK> who sleeps with anything that moves realistic female characters br br in summary a complete mess of a film hopeless <UNK> and performances a <UNK> and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction and ultimately extremely dull its not even comedy bad either laughing at <UNK> face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film
<START> how on earth can people give this movie a low rating unbelievable the performances of <UNK> and watson are so full of merit that i can only imagine that these <UNK> were <UNK> on blockbusters and porn if this sounds bad <UNK> it's because i just wiped my original 400 just now i was so impressed by tom <UNK> all <UNK> the guy this is a performance of considerable subtlety and massive skill his development as an actor from the full monty to this masterpiece of a performance is amazing one of the best things to happen in film making in the last ten years br br emily watson is somewhat less commanding due to that <UNK> in her eye that says <UNK> me this <UNK> woman here you can't guess what i'm going to do next because i don't know either ' it seems to be something she can't help showing us in every role but still she's an actor of terrific ability and presence she is very sexy here as she needs to be and fair play to her for this this is a screen quality that normally for me she doesn't have in previous films br br as you might expect rupert everett required to play an upper class late 30 something who could give at <UNK> level in how not to give a toss about heading to hell on account of total <UNK> delivers he is so thin here throughout the movie however i'm worried for him linda <UNK> is also excellent a role but with a major plot twist to deliver she makes you <UNK> how much talent we have in britain in terms of character acting i want to see more of her br br the narrative arc is fine it's an interesting enough plot given that no one in film making seems to be trying to convince joe public that there's nothing new under the sun though it does stray towards 40s melodrama in the last ' but never mind that this is a terrific 80 minutes worth of anyone who has half a <UNK> money <UNK> to julian <UNK> on his first directorial effort o how we need more films of substance like this he shows a lot of skill in terms of adapting the original novel telling a story with much <UNK> and subtlety and <UNK> too on <UNK> an immense display of the film actor's art from mr tom <UNK> what a <UNK> br br t
<START> you want a movie that'll take you places well this is a good pick if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film the of <UNK> or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch at the risk of sounding cliche you'll laugh you'll cry you'll <UNK> and remember you'll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight you'll recall with <UNK> your best friends from school it's a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realism <UNK> losing friends deciding what to do with your life i think everyone regardless of race age <UNK> standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film there are much worse ways you could spend your time
<START> one would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made for tv movie it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple <UNK> simpson and the prince of <UNK> instead of being a <UNK> <UNK> historical romance br br nor is it helped by the fact that jane seymour and anthony andrews give stiff rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention br br it's hard to understand why a star of olivia de <UNK> caliber would wish to play the supporting role of aunt <UNK> since the role is so <UNK> she just about fades out of sight at this stage in her career olivia was appearing in so many <UNK> roles <UNK> a regal presence but nothing more br br a trivial movie best left forgotten among all the made for tv movies of that era
<START> anna christie 1930 released 2 21 1930 viewed 3 10 <UNK> br br on october 24 <UNK> black <UNK> the stock market crashes now the country and indeed the world will look to hollywood for escape from the worldwide great depression br br <UNK> anne frank june carter bob <UNK> barbara <UNK> doris roberts ed <UNK> dick clark roy e disney gene hackman br br doug at long last our odyssey <UNK> in earnest with greta <UNK> first sound film a simple character study called anna christie an excellent performance from ms garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesn't seem to be <UNK> them how odd one thing i noticed over and over was the way the swedish accent sounds like replacing the letter j with a y sound anna ends up being the only character i liked i didn't really care for her estranged father or her would be <UNK> it looks like the sound recording systems are getting better nobody <UNK> in to talk into the mystery can but the camera still isn't moving we'll be sure to watch for that to change as our odyssey continues br br kevin our first film of the 1930's is the first sound film of silent <UNK> greta garbo anna christie this is a very simple movie with only about five different locations where we spend long stretches of the film's <UNK> minute running time often with a static camera it was great to see marie <UNK> in sound as well and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of heartfelt yet <UNK> <UNK> i very much enjoyed <UNK> performance as she <UNK> the film through even the most meandering moments i didn't really like george marion or charles <UNK> maybe because i wasn't sympathetic to either of them so i was <UNK> and excited when anna finally stands up for herself and shows them that she doesn't belong to either her estranged father or her muscle bound irish boyfriend it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound br br last film viewed <UNK> <UNK> last film <UNK> the love parade <UNK> next film the blue angel 1930
<START> <UNK> br br the best part about driving an <UNK> vehicle is that if any <UNK> approach you at a red light asking for money you can shoot them in the face br br and while the <UNK> guards in this thriller aren't using their protective power to <UNK> the drifter population they are using their position to <UNK> their <UNK> br br when newcomer <UNK> <UNK> short lands a job with an <UNK> <UNK> company he feels like he has found his lot in life unfortunately however when he discovers that his co workers matt dillon jean reno and laurence fishburne are plotting to take the <UNK> m <UNK> for themselves <UNK> must <UNK> himself  and the <UNK>  inside the <UNK> truck br br a tedious caper with a plodding plot and <UNK> in performances <UNK> is an utterly forgettable film br br besides if you really want to jack millions it's a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an <UNK> red light
<START> miss cast away is an amusing <UNK> which <UNK> with serious plot or character development to pack in as many gags as possible best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such <UNK> and perhaps has had a few drinks most of the jokes are current event based so in future years this film may become a time capsule of turn of the 21st century pop culture references br br the to <UNK> of the footage does create a jerky appearance in some parts most <UNK> the opening <UNK> shots br br the appearance of micheal jackson is indeed a strange non <UNK> event but i for one find it <UNK> that mr jackson has shown a helpful interest in one of his <UNK> even after he the director has passed from the cute <UNK> boy stage br br the effects work is not as bad as one review suggested most of it was done by a one man crew in a brief span of time <UNK> of animator william <UNK> whose name seems to have been <UNK> from the imdb credits his work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill in the gaps in this movie i hope he's finally been paid
<START> a desperate attempt to make a film noir sci fi thriller but the movie falls short it has no believable plot some of the key actors were a joke not lars <UNK> he is cool i did like the access <UNK> by though i finished it on principle but went home with the feeling of having lost two hours of my life
<START> this is movie is actually one of my all time favorites i'm not a <UNK> <UNK> fan because most of his movies suck but hits its mark time after time is about a woman named samantha cain davis who suffers from <UNK> she is married with a kid and as she i'm a <UNK> member of the <UNK> and then her world comes <UNK> down as the pieces fall into place about her earlier identity samuel jackson plays a con artist cop who does <UNK> <UNK> he is dragged along by her to solve her identity and to get paid some cash for his work along the way we find out samantha is really charlie <UNK> a secret spy that was left for dead years earlier the plot is great making this story seem real and jackson does a great job as second <UNK> to davis whom always does a great acting job the explosions are endless the action is <UNK> with memorable scene after memorable scene pretty impressive visually though the kid got on my nerves at the end watch out of the cars i'm tired of little kids <UNK> up a film to be saved but still this movie is worth it as the kid adds to the film again this movie is really good i never understood why it didn't make more at the box office but if it was a man starring in the movie i'm sure it would have <UNK> a hundred million what is good is that over the years more people are discovering this movie and giving it good marks as the average of this film on this site has <UNK> over the years i hope it goes up further as this is one great action film and i love action films
<START> with the terrible acting the awful dialog the <UNK> of bad humor the crappy plot and over terrible film this has to be the worst film i have ever viewed in my life and i'm the king of finding bad movies for the effects they just threw fake blood on people and things didn't spend the time to create wounds and make special effects worth anything most people making low budget horror flicks at least do something like of <UNK> or something to make a wound the dialog was far from even decent and the acting was without direction or effort they just threw some actors on a set and said have at it i swear i've seen better films from my film i class at school how did this ever get a dvd release
<START> the evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is <UNK> unleashed to torture all inside what a <UNK> of a movie there's not a single scary scene not one richard crenna <UNK> a nothing role there's some animated ghosts a <UNK> by power saw and a ghost rape after nothing special happens for almost the whole movie the evil gets <UNK> into victor <UNK> great where did the filmmakers get the idea that <UNK> is scary he looks like he was on the bum for a guest starring paycheck to pay his <UNK> bill by then its too late to turn it off because the damn thing is over i felt like throwing the <UNK> out the window please avoid this junk hopefully it will never see the light of dvd and will fade into obscurity
<START> this movie has been a favorite of mine and is <UNK> with the christmas holidays for me for two reasons 1 growing up in the 1960s everything was space related from advertising to television programs and even santa claus found himself in <UNK> during that era and 2 i saw this movie during a christmas shopping trip when i was ten years old and it brought back fond memories of my favorite tv shows when i was even younger <UNK> and <UNK> therefore i am a tad biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons br br that said as a long time student of film this is mainly a movie for fans of <UNK> anderson and barry gray oh that gorgeous score whereas the casual movie watcher will be put off by the future vision from the past dig those wild cars commercial aircraft clothes etc and the so called plot twist which will cause some to <UNK> however if you can look past the post 2001 a space odyssey desire to make a science fiction film with a far out story line and if you enjoy imaginative special effects then you will enjoy this gem from an era when man had just walked on the moon and people were still looking up at the stars in wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the banal <UNK> of the actual 21st century
<START> my friends and i have often <UNK> about movies being in real time but this movie really is they will literally show 4 minutes <UNK> of nothing but a guy digging in the dirt with his hands it has no plot and an incredible amount of gratuitous screaming i honestly don't believe that it won an award for it's alleged suspense if you are like me and saw the first film and loved it for it's horrible acting accidentally hilarious one liners and all around low budget <UNK> it won't matter this is so bad it's bad memories might even rub off and <UNK> any good memories you have of the original you would be more entertained if you were staring at a blank screen
<START> of course i'm a bit <UNK> but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of marines ever shown on the big screen br br i was at camp <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> training when <UNK> brought his crew down to film some <UNK> scenes and our company was asked to participate it took about two or three days as best i can recall br br <UNK> and don were serious and <UNK> br br during the filming of our short scene which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old <UNK> was very <UNK> about getting things marine things right and he did a good job with one exception that scene where a <UNK> was wearing <UNK> never happen for a host of reasons br br i have a video of the movie and will bore my <UNK> anytime i can make them sit still for a few seconds as i show them their when he was a young stud and part of the world's greatest fighting force no <UNK> just fact br br what amazed me then was how well the real marines carried out their acting roles that was before i realized that <UNK> have to have some acting <UNK> to get their job done br br the only film i've seen since that is the equal of the <UNK> is the first half of full metal jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language when the <UNK> was made <UNK> wasn't allowed on screen br br despite the lack of profanity it's still a great movie to rent br br br br fi do or die
<START> as someone who usually <UNK> ali g ali g was absolutely brilliant when i was watching it i was in a hysterical fit yes it is sexist rude and extremely crude and i loved it as some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes this movie was laugh a <UNK> i have never seen a comedy as original as ali g for a comedy starring ali g this would be worthy of an 8 out 10 absolutely brilliant
<START> this has to be the most boring movie i ever sat through it is dreary and drab has no excitement the acting by <UNK> is terrible as <UNK> cannot pull off the proper accent required for this film the story is stupid and i sure wouldn't recommend this crap for anyone unless you want to die of boredom
<START> the psychopath 1973 a trip down memory lane i saw this film many years ago on a old black and white t v a <UNK> show host mr <UNK> the brutal abuse that parents <UNK> upon his kiddie fans mr who looks like he's always on the verge of losing it finally cracks and decides to go on a hunting trip watch out bad parents cause mr is on the <UNK> what happens next is priceless however trying to find this movie will be quite a chore br br what makes this film notable was the fact that joe maniac <UNK> made a short <UNK> reel for a film based upon this one in his unfinished film he plays mr <UNK> a t v clown who looks like a <UNK> out of shape edward james <UNK> who <UNK> his young fans child abuse by going after their parents sadly mr <UNK> could never find the <UNK> to complete the project the film was going to be titled maniac ii mister <UNK> or <UNK> the similarities are all too close for comfort pretty violent for a p g movie br br recommended
<START> this is the funniest sequel i have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary it has some very gory pieces in the film but not bad enough to make you sick in this one he has a female doll companion hence the name if you liked the first three then you'll love this go watch it
<START> if you're interested in learning about the <UNK> side of <UNK> this movie is for you unlike <UNK> movies this shows how things really go down in the world of espionage timothy <UNK> and sean penn both give outstanding performances in this not so well known film certainly worth watching
<START> i'm 35 bruce was the man in evil dead and i still love to watch and it was cool also to see him as the king two or three years ago in <UNK> ho <UNK> in which he showed <UNK> and great acting talent but this screaming brain adventure is certainly not for <UNK> early fans either i'm getting too old for this or i'm just not part of <UNK> target audience anymore i'm positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film but this over extended <UNK> sci fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor campbell better talk seriously with sam <UNK> and get their brains screaming together for a last evil dead reunion picture to get back my interest at least there would be a good director behind the camera sorry bruce this just doesn't cut it for me take care
<START> wow when i went to this film at the toronto film festival i had no idea what i was in for this movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the term <UNK> weaver was better than i've seen from her in years <UNK> <UNK> was great and jeff daniels broke my heart i can see how this won't be every person's cup of tea as at times it deals with some pretty harsh things that can happen to a family don't get me wrong it's really funny too at my screening the audience burst out in applause after laughing over and over again i just think if you're open to <UNK> your own life imaginary heroes will sincerely touch you i can't wait until it comes out in theaters
<START> the usual <UNK> i do not give 1 star ratings to movies which are harmless bad low budget and silly although they may deserve it these films are often funny and get rated 2 4 based on entertainment value not as a representation of their <UNK> film artistry this film fits this model perfectly it is a mexican monster movie <UNK> with voice over narrative and extremely weak not so special effects the makeup is not that bad and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining but this film is almost as silly as aliens vs predator and the script isn't half as slick aliens vs predator might get a 1 from me but i want to see it again before i commit br br the plot is ridiculous but deliciously convoluted if you've read this far you must really want to know a group of remarkably <UNK> scientists <UNK> the main characters most of them are heroes sort of but one is of course mad and quite perverse this mad scientist <UNK> a laughable nuclear powered robot who looks a bit like the tin man from wizard of oz but has a human face inexplicably located inside its head an aztec mummy discovered by the same whose wife just so happens to have been an aztec princess in a past life don't ask is <UNK> against the robot for the big climax the fight scene alone is enough to put the most stoic movie watcher on the floor in belly laughs br br for what its worth given the budget and the utter silliness of the script this is a very entertaining low budget goof ball monster movie if you're into that sort of thing go for it
<START> the main premise for this movie is every woman's fantasy a <UNK> that kills and eats men well at least it is a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man what's that 99 <UNK> of women but don't worry it's not a gory kind of eating of men it's more like a comical <UNK> them in like a drain plug there's no blood or parts left behind so for blood guts gore fans forget about this film not much gore here br br the two main characters of the film are somewhat unrealistic helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute meanwhile dennis is a nice guy who stalks helen br br the story is already a little silly at this point but then they throw in two more equally silly sub stories that just send this movie into the bad b movie territory the first new sub story is about dennis finding new love with a pair of <UNK> twins and then eventually murdering one of them and becoming a fugitive bank <UNK> the second new sub story is about helen finding new love with a nice policeman who rescued her from a prostitution related bad date and decided he wanted to marry her dennis and helen eventually meet up again at the end of movie in totally unbelievable circumstances and magically <UNK> murderous <UNK> is <UNK>
<START> this extraordinary pseudo documentary made in 1971 perfectly captures the <UNK> of america today which makes it all the more scary and relevant <UNK> college students hippies black <UNK> <UNK> are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest as an alternative to life in prison these convicted criminals are offered three days in punishment park their objective inside the park is to make their way to the american flag where freedom <UNK> them not surprisingly the punishment park option is a dirty lie this brilliant film from peter even pre dates battle <UNK> and series 7 though its angle of attack is more blatantly political shot in <UNK> it looks and feels as fresh as anything made today the performances are <UNK> and the direction is <UNK> sharp the narrative cuts back and forth between various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the mccarthy like trials that convicted them today this film still <UNK> its power in <UNK> there was nothing but nothing quite like it this is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels it has the balls that most people today have lost
<START> this early film from director bob clark <UNK> black christmas a christmas story didn't really <UNK> my <UNK> like i expected in fact it straight up annoyed me it's about a theater <UNK> who <UNK> to a burial island <UNK> of dead criminals where they plan to <UNK> some evil forces and <UNK> some corpses the leader of their group a <UNK> black magic <UNK> and possible homosexual attempts to <UNK> <UNK> help with the re animation of an <UNK> body which fails so they take the corpse to the nearby deserted house and play with it nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally spring from their graves and go after the the make up effects are okay the gore is very minimal pg rating and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much which really got on my nerves i guess having group of terrible actors <UNK> for an hour was suppose to equal some comedic status yet i found no humor in it whatsoever the entire concept is just ridiculous how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did the characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just plain boring don't waste your time with it
<START> here's example number <UNK> of hollywood's anti biblical bias so typical of them br br early on ray <UNK> wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of <UNK> the first <UNK> is an old fashioned looking dress mannerisms speech who immediately lays down here strict rules stating that there will be two hours of bible study ever day br br this is said of course to make it sound like reading the bible is the worse punishment you could ever <UNK> on someone especially a kid once again the bible is <UNK> with <UNK> mean spirited people that woman of course is <UNK> immediately br br naturally the liberal black woman whoopi goldberg who else is the one who is hired and <UNK> saves the day br br yawn
<START> as much as we might welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of romance i cannot shake off the feeling that this movie was intended as a direct to video grade c porn movie in which either a the actors backed out of doing the explicit scenes or b the producers ran out of money to hire for the <UNK> an amazing thing if it were true br br i had to go back to blockbuster to figure out why on earth i had rented it which was due to an admittedly amateurish <UNK> regarding the cover <UNK> which seemed to imply a john waters style humor fest with a sexual theme okay i laughed a couple of times and it definitely has a sexual theme although most of it can't be described as stimulating in any way but on some movies you might <UNK> to make sure you heard the dialog correctly on this one you fast forward because you already know what they're about to say but there's nothing to fast forward to so just fast forward past it on the shelf
<START> spoilers spoilers some bunch of <UNK> types are out in the desert looking for <UNK> when they find a hard <UNK> in the middle of a sandy desert area spoilers the dumbest one starts hitting the <UNK> with a pick and cracks it open then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and surprise something eats him the other two are not seen alive again scott looks like a pizza delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree which means he should be about 35 years old minimum is supposed to join camp c and help them find <UNK> the truck that picks up to take him to camp c has a handful of the kind of that usually <UNK> movies like pitch black the thing etc the truck happens to drive across the first truck and they decide to investigate how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up since they were travelling the same road so they find the eaten bodies and there are some decent special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them the main lunatic in the group karl decides that they must find the killer so the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks and eventually it has an <UNK> short and the crew is stuck in the desert the dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around when he takes a <UNK> wearing the same jacket the creatures eat him alive and another guy runs over and sticks his arm into the goo and that <UNK> loses his arm too sounds exciting so far except that a few minutes later dr realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new <UNK> because the <UNK> <UNK> open the old <UNK> now last time i checked ants could move around on their own without having to kill people in order to use the bones for structure if all they need was something hard they could have put a bunch of sticks together and used those to create a form the whole story is really really dumb and the <UNK> explanation is the only one given the rest of the movie is just about the group getting killed off until they find the new <UNK> nest and kill the <UNK> brain sort of and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own <UNK> <UNK> feet there is a spare <UNK> brain found off camera and sent back for analysis thus creating a reason for a sequel
<START> i'm glad that i did not expect too much when i saw this sequel to one of my favourite childhood films the storyline was dull and unconvincing as were the characters and i was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel i also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film charlie had changed and now he has a girlfriend the first film had some good music but the music in this film was <UNK> in short this film just did not do it for me and looking at other user <UNK> it looks like it didn't do it for a lot of you it's not worth watching
<START> br br this movie being one of them br br i remember in the middle of the movie me and my friend just br br looked at each other our heads and laughed in despair br br see it if you wish if you feel that you have the time to waste br br and <UNK> mind 1 5 <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> i first viewed they died with there boots on about 1970 and though it has been many years since this film and its impression remain the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic when i first saw this film i knew the <UNK> as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some i felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong <UNK> however the director <UNK> walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi documentary with other great directors like vincent <UNK> these central figures talked about there <UNK> with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind set this is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable yet there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> class of <UNK> much has been made of <UNK> final class <UNK> but of the <UNK> <UNK> who entered the military academy with him in half of them had already <UNK> out or quit by <UNK> day june 24 <UNK> it is suggested in the movie as the various <UNK> are <UNK> if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong <UNK> and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the <UNK> on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident his <UNK> would follow him to hell your at attention <UNK> <UNK> tape if <UNK> not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that <UNK> did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable to not only sheridan but forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the under general george there is some truth to the <UNK> attributed to battlefield <UNK> as was illustrated when in a <UNK> young <UNK> <UNK> his horse to the lead and <UNK> <UNK> in among the stunned <UNK> as a lone union soldier surrounded by rebels <UNK> <UNK> through he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers including a rebel captain yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first <UNK> battle flag taken by the army of the this notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise robert l <UNK> <UNK> general there is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong <UNK> the story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom <UNK> was to lose his life at the little big horn only a few feet from where george <UNK> was to die as well they were brothers and tom <UNK> to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the <UNK> of honor twice in his military career the list of <UNK> that the motion picture shows indicate that indeed was an active young officer he was not with union forces at either or for that matter however he was with them at the battle of and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general but that was not to last as was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the had the means and the information discovered wrapped around some <UNK> was general lee's plans to split his forces and yet he failed to act for some 17 hours it can be <UNK> that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when failed to act president lincoln replaced him <UNK> and the promotion was lost as a result greatest victory may of in fact come at <UNK> <UNK> his forces which occupied an area called cemetery <UNK> at the field at <UNK> in the summer of <UNK> were able to defeat a <UNK> stuart led <UNK> of some 6 000 rebels with but a force of 2 300 i think the <UNK> at <UNK> by <UNK> are worth some discussion there is <UNK> had in the movie that <UNK> was a <UNK> well you better guess again because not only did <UNK> have men in his corner but he established a <UNK> to present to the <UNK> of the state of <UNK> which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form <UNK> <UNK> though <UNK> was severely for that kind of when he showed up in all that gold <UNK> it was not by accident as you would be led to believe the truth be told defense at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stuart from having lunch at the <UNK> rear stores and <UNK> that this action by the way occurred and it was timed to <UNK> with charge so to make for the greatest <UNK> of success it was a critical victory and <UNK> was at his <UNK> and best his men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it
<START> jack frost returns with an army of <UNK> balls that can only be <UNK> by being shot with super loaded with <UNK> <UNK> that for a plot the film <UNK> on such a ridiculous premise that it barely raises an <UNK> when characters are killed with <UNK> <UNK> and are <UNK> by <UNK> you might even say the whole movie is <UNK> on thin ice <UNK> boom <UNK> br br admittedly there are some fantastic one liners including a remark about the murderous <UNK> shark br br fair enough times are hard but that does not excuse the <UNK> of the actors to take part in such utter tripe br br for those fans hoping to see jack frost be prepared to accept him as merely a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up the beach with corny voice over commentary
<START> 1st watched 8 26 2001 8 out of 10 <UNK> john cassavetes well done early independent film by cassavetes introduced a style that was much different than what hollywood shows it's audience this movie also introduced some very taboo subjects especially the actual racism that probably was prevalent all over the country but was not displayed by the mostly white controlled filmmakers of the time about the only black actors that had much respect at this time were the ones that acted and displayed personality like whites aka sidney <UNK> besides this the idea of ending a film without truly <UNK> the relationships that began leaves many <UNK> <UNK> but actually makes the viewers realize that life is like this it goes on i prefer this kind of an ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what may happen next and the conclusions are not just laid out for you the movie follows the lives of people <UNK> a couple of people who have a brief relationship and happen to be opposite skin colors then we watch what happens when the white man realizes what he's done this is done very well and makes the movie very special the acting is supposedly done <UNK> which makes the movie even more amazing i guess you can say i liked this movie if you can't tell if you can find it check out this classic early independent film
<START> i had completely forgotten about midnight madness until just now when i found it while surfing the imdb now it's all coming back to me br br it was one of <UNK> first movies as well as <UNK> and sharp eyed <UNK> will also pick out <UNK> henry from tv's alice <UNK> he does the voice of <UNK> in the <UNK> the <UNK> cartoons and <UNK> son of dan <UNK> <UNK> from tv's bonanza br br but the two that stand out in my mind are <UNK> from animal house and the himself eddie <UNK> plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad why can't you just accept me for who i am his dad looks over his <UNK> <UNK> frame and gives a simple one word response <UNK> br br and well he's a show in himself as a latter day jerry lewis he stumbles around <UNK> through mini golf <UNK> puts <UNK> <UNK> on his ears and ends up having maggie <UNK> fall for him my hero br br as for the film it's typical early '80s stupidity with college kids staying up after <UNK> and going on a city wide <UNK> hunt to prove which division of students is the best on campus the <UNK> the <UNK> the rich kids the <UNK> or the group made up of a little of each br br who wins who cares you'll have a lot of fun watching disney <UNK> first <UNK> into pg territory before creating <UNK> pictures br br seven stars catch midnight madness any way you can br br long live leon
<START> this film promises much but delivers little the basic problem has to do with the inclusion of charlotte character in this film immigrants from <UNK> did not need a <UNK> <UNK> in any way the movie may have needed her but new citizens certainly did not in my opinion the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film this is particularly <UNK> since it seems to <UNK> not only the characters in the movie but also the history of <UNK> itself immigrants themselves were heroic figures fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what i believer to be a <UNK> image of the white man's burden i wonder if someone will make a movie of irish immigrants which will include a <UNK> woman as a major character the left <UNK> <UNK> considers seven aspects of film acting production sets dialogue artistry film continuity plot and character development on a scale from high of 10 for excellent 5 for average and 1 for needs help both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1 the continuity as discussed above is further <UNK> by the <UNK> ending does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of marc the plot is simple enough until it seems to become <UNK> with too much time in the old country too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending the acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film and the inclusion of the <UNK> <UNK> speaking perfect english almost turns the movie into a satire where's <UNK> when you need him the production sets the dialogue and the artistry are very good each rating a 10 the sets in <UNK> on the ship and on <UNK> island are as good as one can find the dialogue is marvelous and the <UNK> singing is superb i agree with scorsese that listening to the <UNK> <UNK> is a pleasure note that the immigrants speak of america not the united states the ideal vs the political reality the are many good artistic scenes with dreams of america gold <UNK> <UNK> and giant among the best the average left <UNK> <UNK> is 5 25 raised to a 7 0 when <UNK> with the imdb scale one other notion seems to run through <UNK> island experience the <UNK> of pass immigrants was <UNK> later in 2006 one only had to pay a <UNK> or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night no questions asked the movie is worth seeing but it appears that what one sees is
<START> this movie is very difficult to understand why do the couple want to divorce no reason is given we don't know anything about their life in <UNK> and even nothing about <UNK> job we may only understand that a certain bore appeared in this life we don't even know who took the <UNK> of asking the divorce br br the way of filming is kind of special i didn't know the director's name before the end of the movie when i read it on the screen i understood why it was so slow only <UNK> shots in a hundred minutes i counted them it reminded me of some japanese movies i saw in the 90's in fact we must accept that this is the expression of another culture even if the set is <UNK> i don't know if this story would have suited a japanese couple br br one can see the logic of the scenes but the result is a bore anyway i decided to watch it to the end because i wanted to get the spirit and the meaning of it all in fact i only understood that the story of these two beings may not be over yet since the train leaves the station without marie this is few for such a long time i can't recommend this work
<START> i went to this film having no idea what to expect i actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out we both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it br br i only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non mainstream movies it's not as disjointed as <UNK> sky or as <UNK> as forbidden zone the original plot is very easy to follow there's a lot of subtle humor br br here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost a big brother type government keeps <UNK> on everyone in society suddenly a new person appears and there's no data on him he appears insane he may or may not be the second coming of christ the over <UNK> government goes into a frenzy to find him and discover his true motives the <UNK> is also obsessed with <UNK> br br some scenes are frantic while others are completely low key we follow the lead character as he encounters all different kinds of people in society br br i didn't need my consciousness altered to enjoy the film but i know that some of my friends felt that helped br br split was also filmed around santa <UNK> and san francisco
<START> god where do i begin from start to finish i could not help to hate this movie <UNK> <UNK> that make cell phone noises oh yeah i'm so scared i'm going to rid the <UNK> of earth come on people the plot went nowhere when the group discovered the ruin and the village people no pun intended came to warn them and weapons in front of their faces don't worry amy <UNK> malone was there to take pictures that whole scene really had me wondering why she didn't take pictures of her beau jeff <UNK> tucker <UNK> off <UNK> joe anderson legs when the idiots first threw down the rope after <UNK> how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground but how it eventually was able to be a mere two to four feet from the ground i cannot begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie there is just too much to cover i will say the graphics as far as the gore were terrific but it <UNK> to nothing since the acting and script were so <UNK> bad
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life unless you're into <UNK> never see it it was an <UNK> long pointless eye <UNK> depressing movie and will forever top my list of bad movies whoever wrote this movie is a <UNK> i almost cried at the end that's how bad it was i'd like to give it zero stars but since that's not an option i give it one
<START> brilliant aussie movie a little slow at the beginning but once it gets going you can't stop laughing when i originally saw the movie i vaguely knew the plot line as i am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story and more so in particular the director and his mother obviously names have been changed i only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family when i saw the movie somehow my kept it secret that we were to meet matthew <UNK> after the screening such a nice gentleman except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex casting as well with sam <UNK> and others a great reason to keep supporting the australian film industry
<START> <UNK> it sucked i learned nothing about the man i had not heard before the performances were over the top a scene where <UNK> and al are driving down a snowy road in search of women in reno has to be one of the worst conceived scenes in recent memory it's just plain stupid and <UNK> the flashback sequences were terrible and they used the same sequences over and over and over again if i saw the same shot of <UNK> fighting with someone at a base one more time i would have become physically ill by watching this <UNK> we get to learn nothing of what it was like in era we learn nothing about his relationship with his players nothing about his days as a manager nothing about his relationship with his family members other than that they don't like <UNK> i thought when i sat down to view this film i would learn something about the era of baseball in which <UNK> played instead all i got to see was a <UNK> of how <UNK> hated everything and everyone and how they hated him boy what a great movie sarcasm intended <UNK> is portrayed as a constant liar in the film so which one of his stories is supposed to be accurate who knows who cares no one will after viewing this piece of crap if you decide to rent this film make sure the fast forward button on your vcr is working as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly hopefully someday someone will make a good film about <UNK> <UNK> i liked this film about as much as the people in it liked <UNK> which is to say i hated it now i know why i found it in the rent one get one free section of the video store i think i will ask for my fifty cents back from the video clerk since i can't get back the time i wasted watching this trash oh well what could i have possibly been thinking about a movie that would feature robert <UNK>
<START> sir arthur conan doyle wrote a fair number of sherlock holmes accounts but the popularity of the famous detective <UNK> that sequels in both print and on film would <UNK> far beyond the author's works br br in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon holmes basil <UNK> serves british intelligence in order to secure a swiss <UNK> desperately needed <UNK> the film is from 1942 and i wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital <UNK> secrets were the american <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> almost as as the new radar sets that would change the course of world war ii br br holmes and his faithful but <UNK> bumbling companion dr watson <UNK> bruce battle dr <UNK> lionel <UNK> as evil as <UNK> has always been it's a bit of a shock to see he's signed up with hitler has the man no <UNK> of decency i guess not but <UNK> is deliciously evil br br the story is reasonably fast paced as holmes and watson seek to recover stolen <UNK> <UNK> before they can be delivered to a u boat <UNK> is his usual suave self and several <UNK> are well carried out br br this and other 1940s holmes stories are now available on dvd and <UNK> com has put out a very nice four disc set in a wooden box this film is included along with a bonus cd of an interview with the aged doyle the set for about 26 in major dvd and cd stores but i found this and other sets from <UNK> com at a warehouse club for 14 98 the <UNK> are very good br br very nice and relaxing late night viewing br br 7 10
<START> i've always said that there's nothing to beat the original form the comics i've been proved right again this like all of the other movie takes on the <UNK> series failed to impress the makers of this movie don't get it that what makes all the other such comic turned movies x men superman et al <UNK> successful is that they all <UNK> from the original comic versions and adapt it to make it more watchable agreed this movie did <UNK> in the sense that this movie was a cross of two <UNK> books <UNK> <UNK> and the great crossing <UNK> and the also <UNK> of the <UNK> series save <UNK> and the secret weapon a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced all this ended up doing was create a <UNK> immature storyline the funny parts were very few and far between all in all a total waste of time and money watching this let alone at theaters even at home
<START> the melancholy of is an anime that left quite the impression on me partially for the characters many of whom fall into anime fantasy sci fi stereotypes but placing these stereotypes in the rather mundane setting of high school is a twist that i appreciated then there's the somewhat insane titular character who is something else a <UNK> almost amoral girl with ridiculous amounts of talent and a secret that she's not aware of br br the set up for the series is a bit of a mind trip essentially <UNK> to herself is a sort of super powerful being capable of god like <UNK> of creation and destruction as she can destroy and <UNK> reality to her <UNK> our narrator and primary character is a high <UNK> whose sympathy curiosity for appears to cause her to drag him against his will into a club she's starting to spice up her life because she's bored with the normal life searching for adventure she claims three more unusual members each with secrets and they all end up being dragged into her crazy schemes br br there is a bit of crazy but enjoyable <UNK> consideration early on as we debate whether the world is merely creation as she gets bored of the old one and whether our characters exist to serve her or serve her to continue to exist or whether they could exist without her it's a bit of a <UNK> but an enjoyable one all the same while sci fi fantasy scenarios do occasionally occur in the series i think the joy of the series lies in how normal things are while there remains this tension in knowing that if things are too boring might destroy the world in hopes of making it more interesting br br the art is clean and in line with what i've come to expect from the anime that typically gets <UNK> to the us i like the character designs and while there isn't a whole lot of action in the series i think it sits better that way the series is narrated from the mind of and he doesn't play an <UNK> narrator but only comments on what he knows and what he feels he's has a lot going on in his head but he doesn't actually speak a whole lot so it's good that we get to hear it br br the voice acting in the english dub is acceptable enough but i prefer the japanese acting over it there are some stranger aspects to the series some of which both parodies and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> which i found amusing for the first season i have to admit that there's a lack of closure as the series doesn't really have an larger story arc but seems to take things one at a time so it's an easy series to pick up and put down although i think that because of its rather entertaining qualities it's still quite hard to put down it's also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in the writing of the series br br even though it's based on the novels i still wish that the over series had stronger story <UNK> but i love how naturally we get to watch these characters develop and how well the series can play out the quiet moments as well as the <UNK> ones seeing grow herself was quite a treat as well as watching the relationships develop between the <UNK> <UNK> club br br it's not for everyone due to its mind <UNK> premise and extra ordinary beings in a mundane world setting it probably won't <UNK> <UNK> who are into action sci fi fantasy and might be a little too off <UNK> for the more relationship oriented drama lovers but for those willing to try out something a little different or that like strangely quirky series like this i think the melancholy of is a rather <UNK> unique and enjoyable series more please 9 10
<START> it is now clear that the true golden age of american film was from the mid 60s until just before the release of star wars before then there was too much <UNK> code <UNK> <UNK> with star wars the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons a practice which continues to this day the seven ups truth be told contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way is one but i'm damned if i can find anything else wrong with it in fact that line may not even have been stale when this film was made the seven ups demonstrates all that was right with the best films of the golden age sparse dialogue realistic acting real locations winter in a dirty new york has never looked better worse stories and yes the best car chase ever filmed bill <UNK> is the driver <UNK> is chasing you will recognize him from <UNK> and the structure of the chase is fairly similar to the mcqueen one but i prefer <UNK> facial intensity here the pacing the terrific close ups of the <UNK> and the shattering conclusion that <UNK> bug going about 2 <UNK> always bothers me in the <UNK> chase a <UNK> <UNK> score by don <UNK> sets the perfect mood the seven ups bleak grim action oriented grown up this is a film that couldn't be made today there's no gimmick for the <UNK> or preposterous ending thank you philip roy <UNK> and tony lo <UNK> for as long as cop films are watched the seven ups and its 1970s <UNK> e g the french connection will set the standard
<START> boogie nights is full of surprises nothing quite <UNK> one for it its soul yes it does have soul whilst <UNK> the <UNK> of subject matter with both a <UNK> smile and respect cast and wonderful character development the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with <UNK> within a cinema <UNK> style br br the plot proved <UNK> than i expected and the underlying themes are <UNK> out quite profoundly as each b grade human being is brought through crisis into perspective br br a dream case study the film <UNK> the raw truth of what we all know about self <UNK> <UNK> love and lack of it attention love <UNK> and its <UNK> in <UNK> the desperate need to belong something for everyone here almost <UNK> as issues of <UNK> and their separate <UNK> but of course they are universal br br the film works on a number of levels the ironic loop is that the <UNK> portrayed exists only because of the <UNK> who happens to be watching the film br br boogie nights is non <UNK> of its subject matter and characters a <UNK> it deserves every <UNK> it has achieved and more
<START> this movie was everything but boring it deals with reality to the people who think this movie was boring open your eyes to the real problems in our society our children are dying the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored i work in a <UNK> facility as a chemical <UNK> <UNK> and i deal with these problems every day people of all ages and all walks of life are <UNK> by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse it destroys families hurts people and leads to serious brain damage all kinds of health problems and death it is all <UNK> this movie should be shown in every high school in the world if anyone owns this movie and wants to sell it or sell me a copy please e mail me at net thank you
<START> this is an <UNK> stupid boring unimaginative <UNK> put together piece of garbage when watching a direct to video slasher pick it is only fair to expect the film to be trashy on some level but this goes beyond trashy it is just horrible on every level with a cliché ridden script that manages to be both incredibly stupid and incredibly boring at the same time a cast of no name over actors and some of the worst special effects i have ever seen even fans of slasher movies won't be able to find anything here that would make this film a worthwhile use of an hour and a half br br the plot focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend at a remote farm in west virginia that one member of the group has recently inherited unfortunately for the teenagers the inherited land was once owned by a farmer who made sacrifices in order to help his <UNK> grow or something stupid along those lines and now some evil scarecrows are out to kill everybody i don't know anything about writer director paul moore but i am assuming he is over ten years old and therefore he ought to be able to come up with something more original than killer scarecrows honestly br br the special effects bringing the scarecrows to life are laughably poor they often look like hardly more than costumes on sticks special effects such as these would have been considered rather rather poor twenty years ago but by todays standards they are nothing short of embarrassing br br this is a total waste of time for all viewers whether or not they are into horror movies if you must watch a slasher film rent any one of the friday the 13th or halloween movies most of them aren't very good but are certainly superior to crap like this
<START> i have just seen this delightful classic again after many years the next to last film directed by henry <UNK> who died three years later at the age of only 45 the same age at which the film's male star larry harvey was also to die in 1973 three future directors were in the crew jack <UNK> associate producer guy green cinematographer and clive <UNK> editor this film is based upon the <UNK> story <UNK> to by the well known british author christopher which was first turned into a play by john van <UNK> then made into this film then turned into a musical and finally filmed as which brought the amazing <UNK> <UNK> to world attention with her voice which can <UNK> a glass at the distance of a mile appears as a character in the film under his own name he was gay but in those days that was illegal and could land him in prison so he <UNK> his <UNK> under the description of being what he calls 'a confirmed this is the key to his <UNK> relationship with the wildly eccentric wacky <UNK> ever cheerful and thoroughly unique character whom he calls sally <UNK> the portrait of sally <UNK> in this film is a tour de force by the young julie harris who <UNK> every scene into a magical and captivating web of <UNK> personal charm what a vehicle for an actress with plenty of charm of her own it is one of the great cinematic performances of the 1950s is played to perfection by the young lawrence harvey in a finely judged performance which never allows the comedy to go over the edge and even the moments of farce <UNK> on slapstick remain somehow <UNK> larry is so funny at portraying a <UNK> <UNK> what an irony considering the total lack of shown by his bravery and <UNK> in the last year of his life as he died from <UNK> stomach cancer and <UNK> with such dignity and lack of complaint i knew him well in the last three years or so and he was a generous warm and modest person he <UNK> his little girl domino now alas also <UNK> dead this film was his finest early performance to be followed by his spectacular work in <UNK> at the <UNK> 1959 <UNK> and <UNK> and 'the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> larry was often <UNK> in his lifetime because he was too handsome was often cast as a <UNK> and <UNK> boys are not always accepted as good actors but many of the finest actresses played opposite him and they were in no doubt of his abilities and he was a strong lead in many of the most important films of his time if he had lived beyond middle age he would have gone from strength to strength and become a <UNK> old man' of the screen sitting in his house in one day he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel which he had brought from some foreign <UNK> i said he always gave me such delicious wine what was it he proudly answered that it was a which he had chosen himself at the <UNK> in france and had <UNK> over specially he then added with extreme <UNK> <UNK> know i've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask me what it is and you are the first person who has ever done so ' what <UNK> to him was to be <UNK> for having taste in wine and his more glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction in this film anton <UNK> gives a touching early performance as an earnest young man later he was to have to play nazi officers far too much poor fellow and the young shelley winters plays a rich german jewish girl in her usual <UNK> but effective manner but it was not too difficult as she was a <UNK> jewish girl herself anyway this film has such an air of <UNK> de <UNK> about it that it is pure delight
<START> great movie oh yeah full of energy full of fun presenting our generation our alienation a <UNK> to positive thinking despite this world we live in a tale of a great party a tale of a bunch of friends who desperately must do something in a week end and the only thing to do is the club but fun and keep boredom away very funny nicely grotesque in a few points nicely shot and great soundtrack
<START> the lavish production values that you generally find in a <UNK> <UNK> film are all here but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair i agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an african american family and yet their own <UNK> sally <UNK> has barely a role to play in the proceedings there is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures and i was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters nancy <UNK> sounded very british for what one assumes is a french nun and both gwyneth paltrow and greta <UNK> seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes in fact gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic her role as thomas daughter martha is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is one moment she is <UNK> a slave and another moment she's the whole system of slavery nick nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for <UNK> or any of his exploits very disappointing all in all
<START> a good old fashioned flight and revenge western given a twist and a touch of <UNK> by <UNK> a little black social history into its plot lead by mario van <UNK> who does ok the gang of <UNK> on the run from billy <UNK> seemingly <UNK> army <UNK> all <UNK> themselves well their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting <UNK> some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and <UNK> a good shoot out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white and even stephen baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable quite powerful western
<START> a gut ripping baby t rex is on the loose in a small western town <UNK> sheriff eric roberts and animal control agent melissa who walks through her role in a very <UNK> fashion to get to the bottom of things they discover that a mad scientist corbin bernsen is <UNK> to the government <UNK> continuing on with a long abandoned us research project called operation jurassic storm ha by creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground lab facility before long our heroes become trapped inside the marines are called in the power goes out and the <UNK> are set free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their <UNK> and jaws on br br despite an often <UNK> inept script full of plot holes character inconsistencies and loose ends this direct to video copy of jurassic park and <UNK> is fairly <UNK> trash thanks to good production values passable fx the occasional laugh and plenty of brainless action br br someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen from <UNK> but anyone used to watching roger corman productions knows he allows directors to <UNK> <UNK> clips from his early films to save both time and money br br score 3 out of 10
<START> too often screen adaptations of musicals compromise but this is one of those rare occasions when every <UNK> perfect in itself comes together and perfectly midler was born to play this role and her performance will most likely be remembered as definitive she is supported by an ideal cast and the direction and design are tops it doesn't get any better than this
<START> with the nazi rise to power in eastern europe in the late 1930's charles chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it the <UNK> may well have been a propaganda <UNK> referring to chaplin as a jewish <UNK> in the great dictator chaplin created a dead on parody of hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times the film <UNK> hitler's experiences in the german army from world war i up to the present day simultaneously chaplin plays a jewish <UNK> who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time only to discover how different the world is under nazi rule br br <UNK> <UNK> wife at the time plays a young jewish girl whose family is <UNK> in a jewish ghetto jack <UNK> has a great oscar nominated supporting role as a <UNK> look alike who gives <UNK> hitler character a lot of fits henry <UNK> is his usual <UNK> self as chief <UNK> to chaplin wrote and directed the film and received oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting the film was also nominated for best picture br br chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known he <UNK> the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter and there were no other major films made regarding nazi germany up to that time the film spent about twenty one months in production with chaplin even <UNK> a set and re shooting a scene to get things right by the time of the film's release in october of 1940 the war in europe was well under way with hitler <UNK> one country after another so the film became much more <UNK> at its release than when production first began br br there isn't much plot in looking at the film in retrospect the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and or <UNK> strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between and the scene is very very funny but it leads no where in terms of the plot likewise the escape of both the <UNK> and <UNK> simply leads to the mistaken identity of the <UNK> for in order to give chaplin through the <UNK> character an opportunity to <UNK> to the audience at the end of the film on the other hand what better way to make a point about the misplaced <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> than to have a jewish <UNK> mistaken for br br still the film contains many high comic moments such as the <UNK> speech the new war developments <UNK> uniforms etc the dancing globe scene the <UNK> in the <UNK> scene and the entire scenario between and including the <UNK> chair scene to highly recommend the film one can also not forget the risks chaplin took in making his first talking film an anti nazi film and <UNK> the film himself 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> i watch a lot of vampire movies i know vampire movies hammer films have always been my favorites christopher lee will always be the best dracula br br vampire effect is a fun movie from the beginning to the end the dubbing is not great but i also like godzilla movies so i am used to badly dubbed movies anyway i liked this movie very much the <UNK> are great even though jackie <UNK> part in the movie has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the movie he is enjoyable in it the <UNK> work is excellent the acting is not great but this could have something to do with the bad dubbing maybe the actual language would sound better with the movie if i could understand it i am sure the movie gone with the wind sounds worse in another language br br i own this on dvd and would not part with i have it sitting on my next to my hammer films dvds
<START> okay here's the thing i've read through the comments of other viewers some <UNK> the film and some saying it's the funniest darkest <UNK> comedy ever made <UNK> of tarantino etc well not exactly but guess what it's still an enjoyable and ultimately funny film not brilliant not trash <UNK> tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her she's a woman with very strong <UNK> ideas matt dillon a greatly underrated and under used actor is wonderful as ever he always manages to <UNK> that delicate line between and soul and he pulls off the comedy beautifully <UNK> john goodman though the religious overtones probably funny in the script really don't work paul reiser is very good definitely better than he was on tv br br the usually unbearable michael douglas is actually great in this role as for his <UNK> well see the film between this and wonder boys you're actually reminded of the fact that douglas can act the movie will make you laugh in parts okay not exactly belly laughing but definitely in the i'm amused i'm very amused category if you're renting this expecting to see another pulp fiction forget it but if want something kinda hip and kinda fun this is a damned good choice
<START> the first two bring it on movies were both quite good in their own ways the first was fairly serious the second was successfully satirical and the third <UNK> for the usual idiotic low brow comedy that we always see in the utterly brainless teen movies that hollywood has coming out of the <UNK> the entire point in this movie was that <UNK> are total <UNK> who hardly know enough to carry on a common conversation and that's the extent of this movie's comedy ha ha not br br there is no shred of <UNK> in this movie no theme no subtext nothing for anybody with half a brain to be entertained by and sure enough i could not sit through all of it if you're the sort of person <UNK> entertained by fart jokes this movie is for you <UNK> br br 2 out of 10
<START> <UNK> is a mindless vampire movie with a few twists on an ancient plot special <UNK> team is sent into south america to hunt down blood sucking natives their leader is a real old man who has aged well there's an <UNK> twist as the vampires are attacking <UNK> because their rain forest and old <UNK> of wild animals is disappearing because of the greedy <UNK> and <UNK> lost of fighting and so much blood they just never bothered to wash off the cast for the whole film it looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and <UNK> on blood while each member of the cast brought their own talents it really didn't all click as a film the effects were ok except for the vampires <UNK> from the buildings on <UNK> if you're looking for lots of blood and violence this is for you
<START> so far <UNK> career it's been one of the more dreadful of recent spanish cinema he's made nothing but rubbish until now has been quite a surprise it's a serious film with rhythm with a great cast and very entertaining br br the art of robbing that's what is about a film much alike to david <UNK> house of game and stuff like that a thousand of twists in the script and a story where <UNK> like it seems br br the weak points in latest movie may be the so american language that makes some of the characters look rather unnatural especially victoria she's a hell of an actress but in she looks a little bit forced <UNK> <UNK> is not that bad but he's not half as good actor as his father and what to say about well he's the man br br in short a good movie the best that <UNK> <UNK> has ever made i hope this is the beginning of a brand new stage in his career br br my rate 7 10
<START> even though this movie starts off with the usual something goes wrong <UNK> crashes people are stranded etc it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas <UNK> is somewhat of a bad ass convict and has <UNK> his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship crew and he gets in the cutting in the movie is very good and <UNK> the <UNK> that around the anti hero and male protagonist <UNK> the story in pitch black is as already mentioned to some extent very unoriginal and <UNK> but the <UNK> and cutting in the movie <UNK> with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and <UNK> for more <UNK> <UNK> acts really well in the role as <UNK> and even though his character is a hardcore tough survivor he still takes <UNK> decisions almost on the verge of good but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end why destroy an already perfect reputation all in all this is a very good movie though not perfect the story seems very unoriginal at the surface but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average it could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a <UNK> up sci fi story <UNK> with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist namely <UNK>
<START> this film was utterly horrible stupid premise and horrible acting by all whoever wrote this trash should be <UNK> reminds me of a hack student film but worse who ever produced this should give up now i know opinions are <UNK> and all and some may think this fantastic as some think <UNK> 1984 was fantastic well get off your horse and watch some real films ok the acting was tolerable and with better direction could have been far better but it didn't so it suffers i don't know how much more i can say about this waste of film other than to totally trash it anyways it was horrible and i recommend to avoid it like the plague if you come anywhere near <UNK> rent the movie beside it instead
<START> remember that this came out before <UNK> war i which gave us <UNK> <UNK> lessons of darkness br br le <UNK> combat is not sci fi it's more like judgment i've watched it at least a dozen times it really is a fitting companion to <UNK> lessons of darkness and in that time men will seek death but they will not find it for death will flee from them br br that someday alas may be today in iraq br br but back to le <UNK> combat make sure to watch thru the very last second of the film i wouldn't call it a surprise ending but it is something you'll miss if you just assume the end won't be anything more than what you will already have seen
<START> i saw this movie and was bored out of my mind i am a fan of <UNK> but i can't understand why charles <UNK> let this disaster be made spoilers ahead br br i can't believe <UNK> would let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar and <UNK> a few cold ones without standing watch the story was complete nonsense even for comic strip characters it takes them <UNK> long to get to france plus once they get to france i had a feeling that the writer i still can't believe it was <UNK> didn't know what to do once they got there br br <UNK> is best made in 30 minute episodes not 80 minute movies br br go home charlie brown you are at your best there br br
<START> bon voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough <UNK> to keep viewers <UNK> engaged and invested in the outcome most importantly though the film is also historically <UNK> it captures the tension of the so called phony war and later the french flight from paris ahead of the german <UNK> yet bon voyage is not a war movie it is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times bon voyage conveys the chaos confusion and emotional <UNK> of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of french reactions to the new political order this film is a comedy which entertains the audience a romance which <UNK> <UNK> many clichés and a story of a handful of people whose nation is <UNK> around them
<START> this is one of those star filled over the top comedies that could a be hysterical or b wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead unfortunately one night at is a classic b br br goldie hawn recently commented about town and country that it's a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also <UNK> it daily maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say it's the script stupid br br this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through they're working their <UNK> off trying to make all this seem hysterical but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the <UNK> you can hear inside the silent theatre br br is it an <UNK> disaster not entirely there are some smiles along the way mostly due to the efforts of the actors i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking eh it was okay so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review the ending if as it's been noted the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending then it misses spectacularly i really wish i could speak specifically about it but i hate people who give too much away even in warning suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent over paul reiser nothing given away here it's in the trailer get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking eh it was okay the rest of the movie is tacked on and <UNK> <UNK> and you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess br br if you loved there's something about mary or meet the parents both great movies then don't bother to see this movie go have those teeth taken care of instead
<START> i give <UNK> a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos in order to clock in as a feature length film since when does that count as film jennifer <UNK> plays alex <UNK> an aspiring 18 year old dancer who <UNK> has a job as a in a <UNK> steel factory not a line of work most older women find their way into much less 18 year olds fresh out of high school meanwhile at night she works as an exotic dancer who never actually takes off her clothes in a <UNK> <UNK> bar called yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at you would think they were working at the best casino on the las vegas strip br br alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss nick <UNK> michael who is about twice her age after <UNK> <UNK> advances because going out with the boss isn't a good idea she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date alex and nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to <UNK> co workers br br when <UNK> isn't being <UNK> for the many dance sequences in the movie her character spends most her time throwing temper <UNK> <UNK> dream is to get an <UNK> only audition at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of dance inexplicably when her boss boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of she's throws one her <UNK> she <UNK> tells nick she isn't doing the audition because of his <UNK> and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel this is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this br br of course alex does eventually get her audition at the <UNK> she puts on a dance routine before the <UNK> board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie <UNK> to the mtv generation oh yeah it is a dance routine in a movie <UNK> to the mtv generation br br i don't think i can judge whether or not <UNK> can actually act well on the basis of what i saw in <UNK> this is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written that i don't think it is a fair <UNK> test of her acting abilities br br you have to hand it to the makers of <UNK> though this movie is proof that the <UNK> film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign in this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy <UNK> on mtv if they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that i cared about instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a <UNK> brain can't take seriously a truly forgettable film
<START> nothing like this was seen on tv at that time and probably never will again from the first image of that police light <UNK> you and from there you heard the words police squad in color you were to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom br br also to kill off a guest star and then never refer to him again where had you ever seen that before then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention you would miss several jokes in the background don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry this was the show that video <UNK> were made for way before married with children or the simpsons br br the stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before <UNK> that it was a joke br br the characters frank and ed came right out of <UNK> and they were absolutely straight no funny accents or expressions but instead there were <UNK> and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan only once as i can remember were there a segment played for silly laughs a scene involving a trip to a dentist <UNK> and a whole lot of <UNK> br br there were some tedious moments like the informer johnny and an appearance by some celebrity that was strictly a one joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes oh well everything can't be perfect the important thing is that the rest of the time you were <UNK> deep in tears of laughter br br leslie <UNK> was fortunate that this <UNK> his career when they put the frank character in 3 features but it must have been an <UNK> <UNK> as well can you remember seeing him in anything except naked gun type work since and don't count the awful mr <UNK> <UNK> for live action he probably made a lot of money though
<START> while this isn't an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then br br harold lloyd plays <UNK> <UNK> an american coming home after growing up in china where his dad was a <UNK> he has come home from china to find an american wife and plans to return to china to continue his father's work <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect <UNK> to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town's underworld they figure the bumbling stumbling <UNK> has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich br br lloyd isn't doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films he does a convincing portrayal of <UNK> with a reserved understated dignity the acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good br br being made in 1934 the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes aren't nearly as mean as i've seen from other films from that time br br although not close to being <UNK> best film this movie does entertain and lloyd is very good as <UNK> you won't be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in lloyd and make you want to see more of his work
<START> but certainly a serious <UNK> for one of the worst 10 of all time br br i got this dvd cheap with sandra <UNK> as <UNK> on the case this is false advertising she's on screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie br br on the other hand there was no other selling point for this movie the dialog was horrible the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on <UNK> the directing was well let's just say that my 14 <UNK> daughter could do better but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me it's possible that the family cat could have done better br br sandra does a <UNK> job for a first film in the short time she's on screen and that's the only redeeming quality of this film stupid story poorly written and transferred to film as only a <UNK> grade media class should be able to do br br in short this is dreck
<START> as the <UNK> flies <UNK> this steaming <UNK> <UNK> of a film i found myself longing to join them br br from the opening sentences you quickly gather that the actors are talentless the script editor was probably dead and the director should be to be honest i didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress <UNK> across the floor like a <UNK> <UNK> that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach br br i have never and i mean never seen a film as <UNK> as this one and i watch tons of crap films br br turd
<START> other than it <UNK> the characters from the first film and gave them more <UNK> essentially <UNK> the werewolf fell in love with <UNK> the vampire a romeo and juliet scenario you know is going to end badly if you've seen the first movie so with absolutely no suspense we <UNK> forward with two hours of <UNK> cgi and actors with little or no screen presence all shot in that <UNK> color that the first movie had because nothing was shot in daylight br br worth your time probably not in fact the quality has gone down even the cgi looks like it was done on the cheap you don't buy for a minute that these are real werewolves
<START> the film deals with universal themes mentioning no specific country as its context it could happen anywhere and has in substance if not form those concerned about 1st <UNK> issues censorship et al but don't want to be bored with <UNK> need art such as this to illustrate <UNK> teach inspire br br <UNK> is certainly an under appreciated character actor he shines in this film showing off multiple acting talents that you must see i have yet to see him give a bad performance though even in not so great films <UNK> gives perhaps her best performance and proves that she possesses one of the most striking pair of eyes in hollywood in two words stunning convincing br br the set design perfectly matches the situation in function and mood the sound editing <UNK> to appropriate effect the total contrast conveyed through the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device and the welcome and only <UNK> to the bulk of the story's necessary <UNK> the script is tight and essential with <UNK> dramatic yet realistic dialogue i e as it might be and ought to be perhaps the most amazing aspect to <UNK> with is the fact that 1 this is the director's first time out and 2 he is the writer in one phrase a tour de force with three <UNK> see it own a copy see it repeatedly to <UNK> all its secrets and grasp all it genius
<START> it's been awhile since i've seen cold mountain bit i do knew that i enjoyed it immensely though it does take place during the the last days of american civil war it's not really a war movie it's more of a romance drama and it works mainly because of the performances usually i don't like nicole kidman but i liked here i thought she was very convincing in her role i liked <UNK> as well who i'm not usually a fan of jude law is good as usual the supporting cast there are some great supporting performances her too numerous too mention there's also some breathtaking scenery in the film and there are also a number of very nice musical pieces as well the story is sad and <UNK> with tragedy but it s a beautifully done well told story for me cold mountain is an 8 10
<START> for any fan of <UNK> who used to watch the network in the 80s and 90s there was always something good on you had entertaining acts like you can't do that on television you had weird but good shows like pete pete you even had cartoons that taught morals like doug but just like disney <UNK> has fallen down the <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> to shallow <UNK> and giving us poor excuses to come up with new innovative shows as i tried watching <UNK> 101 i just <UNK> my head in disgust br br the setting couldn't of been more fake than this one each character <UNK> a <UNK> school called pacific coast academy <UNK> everything that a spoiled child wants a <UNK> bar everywhere flat screen <UNK> in every room cool <UNK> to hang out etc the kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers it looks more like a place that you would spend on a nice summer vacation rather than to work and study while preparing for college br br the characters were also a factor that turned me off every episode consists of boy problems situations that they caused themselves and troubles that should be solved each character is a stereotype <UNK> jamie <UNK> seems perfect in anything she does and each of her friends ask her for help when they feel they are in grave danger only leading her to have no other side i've been through school and i can tell you nobody is like that chase is dumb logan plays the arrogant tough guy quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic in what she does michael is an idiot lola is a clone of nicole dana is just well a tough person why not use some originality something that is unique for these characters and different from other personalities is being stereotypical the best the creators of this show can come up with instead these actors are dull personalities with the sense in that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles there is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at br br not only that but the show is clearly for the intent of aiming for kids of <UNK> facing a stage in that they must <UNK> from being a child to being an adult through that period they must learn to study on their own make their own decisions and do what's right for them <UNK> 101 contains nothing of those values in this case we are supposed to believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed i'm sorry but that simply isn't true people can't expect things to be handed to them like the actors in this show are and just let those things sit there if i expect things in <UNK> 101 to happen in real life then i would be living in a fantasy world locked away in a dream house nothing in this show relates to those who face health and money issues neither does it relate to kids wanting to learn something meaningful br br so in conclusion <UNK> 101 is a show made by <UNK> that only falls flat on it's face it displays a horrible message for kids and i highly think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them sure it doesn't have morbid violence but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid a horrible show and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage <UNK> has been making in recent years br br 1 out of 10
<START> kinda funny how comments for this film went consistently downhill now add mine i think the script could have been saved by better acting and the acting by a better script together it was difficult to watch and i don't <UNK> from such subject matter br br <UNK> was the best part i thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this film offered to its genre but even she <UNK> can't blame her who knows what takes were left on the cutting room floor by the director and or editor the whole movie had an okay that's good enough let's move on feel to it when i know there was more to be <UNK> from the actors and the script which did have some good lines and some interesting themes br br i don't think this counts as a spoiler but a perfect example is the scene where <UNK> <UNK> up to her son's supposed house and has this look on her face and i thought that's the face of someone who is overacting what it's like to see someone living in a mobile home and sure enough next shot meant to shock us i'm sure bully lives in a trailer as opposed to a nice house like hers br br as many other posters have pointed out there are so many better movies with similarly <UNK> scripts about similarly messed up families that hit the notes better celebration probably being the ultimate example that i've seen
<START> i thought the movie was sub par the acting was good but not great the story was funny but did not come out that way the director dropped the ball on this movie it was not james jim or tea imho it was the music that killed it there is a scene where things go down hill and <UNK> cash music is playing man was that depressing not funny killed my mood after that the movie could not recover the <UNK> scene had potential funny situation good acting good set up i even <UNK> but the music again was <UNK> to the scene the music kept me from being pulled in to the movie br br i say it had potential but was poorly done i would even say rushed into final production kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist the beginning the theater release was good i though so after watching it but the movie release exorcist <UNK> was a <UNK> lot better same story just different director same should be done here
<START> is a terrible horror technological thriller dee <UNK> plays <UNK> a disgusting computer freak who <UNK> on young girls through the chat rooms his ridiculous <UNK> on pain and suffering are both misguided and totally <UNK> there is no tie to reality with the ideas that are presented in this film it is more like dee <UNK> sat down and tried to think up the <UNK> stuff possible to impress horror fans and maybe some of his old fans but the end result is just awful br br unfortunately for me as a horror fan the cover of this movie looks very good and it immediately caught my interest which is the main reason that i was tricked into watching it i assure you that this is not a quality horror movie it is a disturbing yet boring attempt to suggest what might go on in the minds of people who treat themselves the way the <UNK> did in this film the sad part is that no one does this stuff to themselves marilyn <UNK> <UNK> doesn't even go that far and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film wasn't meant to poke fun at his type of music that would be a stab at <UNK> himself it is more like dee <UNK> was trying to raise himself from the career dead and present himself as a sick minded individual once more dee it seems that the time has come to let it all die
<START> this movie is well done it really attempts to show what the dinosaurs had to <UNK> with in their daily lives the animation is very well done and the film makers have done a great job of giving scientific fact in such a way that it is entertaining this is a great movie
<START> it is difficult to compete against classic greatness but once you make that choice and the decision is in play you need find the best and <UNK> resources to keep your product top <UNK> and on the cutting edge of quality if your intention is to aim for second or third or fourth best why even try it is with that i wonder why this version of the ten <UNK> was written produced and aired i would ask the producers what were you thinking were you <UNK> to create a projected <UNK> if perhaps the producers were thinking we want to examine this biblical story from another point of view then i would say ok i watched the show now what's the point of view the premise of this possible point of view theory <UNK> me i can generally watch programs and right or wrong at least get a sense of what the creators were trying to accomplish not so here i recognize names such as robert the producer and i can associate his work with some eye catching product tin man flash gordon jason and the <UNK> low budget entertainment based on myth history and comic book entertainment a perfect genre for sci fi channel so i still have to ask robert what was the point of this ten <UNK> what were you thinking
<START> i saw this movie at a <UNK> and its the best movie i have seen in a <UNK> time i loved it james franco is <UNK> hot and him and <UNK> miller make the perfect couple i don't want to give away what happens but they play a pair of <UNK> who go off on their honeymoon to <UNK> falls and some pretty wild stuff happens along the way the movie is really really funny and sad and original i can't even say what it reminded me of but go see it i cried so hard but really loved it and wanna see it again as soon as it comes out my friends cried too i hope it comes out soon does anyone know when i would really go see it if i were you
<START> i went to see this film last night at the national film theatre in london as a birthday treat it was the the first time i've seen it and i think it has now <UNK> the dreadful <UNK> as the worst film i have ever seen disjointed for no reason self indulgent and full of imagery that from the crass and obvious to the obscure and <UNK> not particularly beautifully or shot i really don't understand why this is considered classic gay or otherwise i normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even films that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography but this was truly truly awful
<START> the year still has three weeks to go but unless a really horrendous turkey shows up before then passion of the mind may be the winner of my <UNK> movie of the year contest an interesting idea badly executed and for that matter badly acted <UNK> moore is very good at <UNK> her lip and smoking <UNK> but is that all she does and why so many <UNK> did and myers or one of the other bad boys of <UNK> have some of their <UNK> <UNK> invested in this production it's confusing silly and moves at the frantic past of a <UNK> <UNK> i gave it a 3 should have been a 2 br br
<START> good things out of the way first br br voice acting was fine but jason lee being awesome himself that really is no surprise br br peter also did fine for what trash was given to him he acted the part shockingly well and so did patrick <UNK> the moronic assistant now it was idiotic character but he acted so extremely well i actually liked the character better than the protagonists the lines given to him were childish but witty br br however alex did awful and hope he never acts again his scream was so <UNK> fake silence silence in the scene where he hears the dog talk an oh no impossible would have <UNK> in place of the pathetic fake scream br br and then there was the girl and her female dog that chased <UNK> character <UNK> on the roof at first this makes sense she's a reporter a school reporter but still an <UNK> mind regardless but why why the hell did she carry her dog around that was worthless and the damn dog didn't even say anything other than a heartless oh underdog her presence was extremely unnecessary br br overall the script was pathetic the only reason i give this movie a 3 is his assistance and voice
<START> awful film terrible acting cheesy totally unrealistic embarrassing to anyone who has played the game for a start that guy is not a hooker he would be <UNK> in two as for score that's my well no it's not for the the <UNK> american audience it might come across as a good film for me well that's a few hours of my life i'll never get back i read through the reviews and came across one where the guy sounded like he knew what he was talking about then i read br br while american <UNK> may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has third in the world is also nothing to hang your head br br all i can say is br br keep playing your american football and baseball leave the real sports to the big boys
<START> bette midler is the best thing about this movie it is a poor second to the original from <UNK> with natalie wood as gypsy the songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better <UNK> voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to <UNK> only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie br br there was not enough of a change between ugly <UNK> to beautiful girl when natalie wood was gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her <UNK> for the first time to perform in the <UNK> show when she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star not just a poor substitute to her sister and the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through it was an important part of the movie and they butchered it it is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original it was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie i was completely disappointed and had it not been for bette midler i would have shut the movie off
<START> i watched the first episode of the war at home because i thought it was worth replacing arrested development boy was i disappointed it should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly ripped off of grounded for life <UNK> and married with children since they are all similar in plot and overall mood the so called punch lines are all <UNK> and formulaic even more those punch lines aren't even funny at all to me they're more along the lines as being crass and crude the main character dave gold acts like a white trash thug who thinks he's being funny and cool which he's not even <UNK> <UNK> daughter said so in the episode strip br br in the episode dream <UNK> <UNK> wanted to be a singer but was actually pretty bad dave and <UNK> then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked after that she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to <UNK> after telling dave and <UNK> so and left the room the two of them began <UNK> mocking her also in the first episode dave said of black boyfriend does she actually think we're gonna let her go out with this guy i'd rather drink my own <UNK> that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television and dave is constantly making fun of larry his son when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a geek also let's not forget that he also made fun of <UNK> fat girlfriend dave is the father he's supposed to stand up for his son no matter what the war at home is without a doubt the worst tv show for family that clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it <UNK> a racism and <UNK> agenda it's like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something but the lines are all somewhat forced idiotic and <UNK> juvenile br br another reason why the show's horrible is the acting mike <UNK> and kyle sullivan are terrible terrible actors <UNK> has to always move his hands around when he's in front of the camera he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with boston public sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts he also did this in malcolm in the middle br br so to wrap this whole thing up you all got your reasons of what's wrong with this show 1 it's unoriginal 2 the acting sucks 3 it's not even funny 4 all the jokes are the same 5 has lousy script 6 the characters are pitiful and unlikable 7 the <UNK> a rip off of <UNK> <UNK> br br fox needs to take this trash off the air because <UNK> better than this
<START> like anyone else who bought this i was <UNK> by the 20 pieces of extreme gore and banned in 20 countries or whatever it says in the box i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it tom <UNK> rick baker and greg <UNK> are some of the best in the business the <UNK> make up effects in the 80's today you don't need them as everything is done on computer but computers cannot compare to the visual <UNK> that these three men could <UNK> up but i <UNK> br br watching fantastically gory films like <UNK> gates to hell or even <UNK> <UNK> achievement friday the 13th the final chapter you can appreciate all that goes into making a <UNK> gory film you can't tell the difference between reality and magic br br i can't imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal <UNK> but the gore that is ostensibly <UNK> in this film if that is the reason you seek this film then you are wasting your money as many other reviewers in here have noted most of the gore is an aftermath you don't see the torture or the bloodshed as it happens you see whatever it looks like <UNK> br br the gore well it's here but not as much as one would hope or expect a man does get <UNK> and a women does get <UNK> by her breasts but other then those two scenes and one involving a there is nothing really much else to this film the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but i was expecting a bit more call me sick or twisted but isn't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places br br cannibal <UNK> is just another film that tries to capitalize on a <UNK> of a superior film while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film it is much better than this tripe if you go out of your way to buy this for 20 00 you will feel cheated br br 3 10
<START> bean kevin perry uk tv creations that have made successful transitions onto the big screen now its ali <UNK> turn and i m afraid to say this is not one of them br br ali has always been obscene but funny with it this film was sick and not funny at all scenes involving <UNK> gay sex and <UNK> should not be portrayed for <UNK> sake br br ali g in da house is rubbish and deserves making very little money br br 1 out 10
<START> first of all i'd like to say i'm just an amateur in commenting movies and that english is not my native language but that i felt a strong feeling compelling me to write about such movie possibly as a way to thank and <UNK> c jay cox the cast and the crew for such a brilliant production br br yesterday i watched latter days for the first time br br at first i thought it might be similar to the movie priest which i liked very much for showing a gay priest out of the closet but priest maybe due to its <UNK> catholic <UNK> notions didn't supply my needs by revealing a profound sad end br br latter days on the other hand broke that concept and some other ones as well such as the <UNK> principles presenting a tender and cheerful story leading it to a happy and <UNK> end and yet <UNK> a feeling of god's <UNK> and hope a great movie indeed br br somehow latter days made me feel l a as a city of angels br br i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes <UNK> beautiful gay love stories
<START> this movie <UNK> to show a middle class family's attempt to figure out what is going down in the america of the late 1960's their trip to a rock festival is as far as their old bus gets without exception the characters are superficial stereotypes br br if you want to know which well established hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days just look at the credits <UNK> i had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the <UNK> thank god his career <UNK> before his <UNK> death br br the writers on this television turkey were clueless outside of doing <UNK> their insights into the hippie movement were laughable
<START> i'll give it this i didn't stop watching and it's not corporate which is kind of cool but my internal critic cut it to pieces i suppose i see too many movies wooden script the <UNK> just sort of out of their mouths without any kind of flow editing mentioned before is hit and miss sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel but mostly its irritating jerky quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups the actors were <UNK> though had her moments br br i'm not sure why the audience supposed to care about curtis he's a total <UNK> and the actor is entirely <UNK> and not particularly funny or endearing the directing doesn't help make you love him or hate him even i just wanted him to shut up and get shot already i didn't care about his <UNK> vengeance when that rolled around the completely predictable ending isn't credible at all i'm not sure why we're supposed to believe that some <UNK> successful dealers he are stupid enough to fall for his petty <UNK> oh you just got out of jail and are on <UNK> here's thousands of dollars worth of cocaine go run it around the corner for me now don't steal from me etc br br a good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope but it was let down in the end handling of a rape scene was slightly <UNK> raising if only mildly interesting there are better movies in this genre that don't insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a film school offering 4 10 an f
<START> awful confusing bit of crap from south of the border i've now watched it twice and i still don't really know what was going on it had something to do with a stupid looking aztec mummy a that's the dumbest looking robot i've ever seen bar none and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient aztec chick most of the story is told in a painfully slow and <UNK> manner by an incredibly dull scientist this guy is a marvelous sleep aid his nemesis is a fat <UNK> called the bat which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist br br i guess the boring scientist and his <UNK> assistant <UNK> up the mummy and what a shocker the <UNK> wife just happens to be the reincarnation of the <UNK> girlfriend they keep the mummy <UNK> in a <UNK> for some reason i guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it it takes him five years to do this because he's <UNK> a to steal the mummy or attack it or whatever he's after some treasure that the mummy has so that he can be rich but excuse me if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed why didn't he just <UNK> some of his ideas and get rich that way br br oh well i suppose that would make too much sense instead there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot and it's really hard to tell which one is <UNK> looking or more cheesy to tell you the truth i watched this because i thought a film with a name like the robot vs the aztec mummy just had to be <UNK> cheesy instead it was just <UNK> awful and mind <UNK> confusing
<START> it was so boring no plot whatsoever basically a watered down version of the lion king mixed in with animal farm again no plot at all horrible worst hour and a half of my life oh my gosh i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief i maybe <UNK> twice all of the semi funny parts are in the previews i hate movies like that yeah the movie pretty much sucked i don't know how it got such good ratings and reviews there is no plot or storyline if you do go see this movie bring a <UNK> or a girlfriend boyfriend to keep you occupied through out awful i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 7 50 to see this crap
<START> <UNK> for a lost soldier is a sad example of how not to translate to film a touching complex psychological study of that most magical time in a man's life when he is still a child but starting to become a man the novel records the real life experiences of <UNK> van as told thru the boy <UNK> during the <UNK> days of wwii at age 11 as he deals with his <UNK> sexuality and his deep fears of <UNK> as he has been sent to the <UNK> of north of holland by his parents because of the lack of food in <UNK> and has not heard from them in many months as the <UNK> service has broken down the arrival of the <UNK> soldiers in the film is presented in a painfully corny way with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style then one soldier walt romances <UNK> and the pair is presented as two <UNK> males who <UNK> their love in a sexual experience this taken in <UNK> by the 11 <UNK> <UNK> the reality was somewhat different <UNK> describes his encounters with walt 6 in all in detail but in <UNK> language but there is no <UNK> their nature walt is <UNK> to an intense passion by <UNK> during which he handles him roughly so that in their final meeting <UNK> is <UNK> and suffering a painful wound on the shoulder where walt has bitten him during this encounter walt rapes <UNK> twice <UNK> could have easily avoided walt after their 2nd encounter when walt first <UNK> him as walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers why <UNK> keeps seeking walt out is a mystery of the human heart and not <UNK> by me anyway what the film leaves out is the aftermath the nightmares the the frantic search throughout <UNK> on the chance of finding walt for <UNK> loved walt and nothing could shake that
<START> certainly not a bad little low budget film this bride of the gorilla but nothing special neither and not memorable enough to be <UNK> among the meaningful sci fi efforts of its time director <UNK> <UNK> was an <UNK> scriptwriter during the 1930's and 1940's and delivered stories for some true genre classics i walked with a zombie the wolf man but as a director he obviously lacked the required <UNK> bride of the gorilla is similar to the aforementioned the wolf man in story and atmosphere but the film looks a lot more amateurish and pitiful both handle about cursed men that turn into large animals at night but the titular gorilla doesn't look half as threatening as the werewolf even though the film got released a whole decade later during a cheesy opening speech actor <UNK> <UNK> tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place and hiding many mysteries but actually there's no real mystery in the plot it's just handles about a plantation manager who's jealous at his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and he kills him a native woman witnesses his crime and puts a spell on barney that causes him to <UNK> into a <UNK> big gorilla at night or maybe she just wants him to believe he's turning into a <UNK> big <UNK> himself plays the police <UNK> charged with the murder investigation while raymond <UNK> who starred in about a thousand perry mason tv movies portrays the greedy plantation manager <UNK> gorilla <UNK> attempts to make the film look like a supernatural thriller  is it or is it not all just happening in <UNK> head  fail miserably and it causes way too much talking and too few jungle action several of the jungle settings are nicely <UNK> but the rest of the special effects are tacky and poorly done still the acting is pretty good barbara <UNK> is looking beautiful and  although very predictable  the story is strangely compelling until the very end weird movie it probably voodoo cursed <UNK>
<START> <UNK> around on <UNK> sometimes thought an urban comic book legend the first <UNK> movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears i guess marvel comics now pretends it doesn't exist what with the 2005 version out in theaters earlier this year but it's out there a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad low budget marvel super hero adaptations captain america <UNK> most of the tv movies <UNK> <UNK> is too easy a description for this <UNK> <UNK> due to basically no <UNK> showing the powers of the super <UNK> was limited to very quick shots mr fantastic quasi animation torch and fades invisible girl the <UNK> to do the thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget the face part was especially almost convincing the acting alex hyde white as reed is pretty good the other 3 are ok tho jay as johnny acts like a <UNK> at times to sort of show off his temper the dialog is comic book style and it's the supporting cast which ends up <UNK> trying to make it work dr doom is way over melodramatic and unintentionally comical and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act or write dialog br br the plot not too good it was quite faithful to the origin story of the <UNK> more so than the later big budget version and even though the non budget again <UNK> showing for example the actual crash landing it kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area it's the best part of the picture tho you have to wait a full half hour for it i also found the music odd in places when the 4 are <UNK> in those <UNK> <UNK> a kind of church choir is heard as if it's a religious experience the rest of it however is hopeless even with no budget the story could have done without the character resembling the mole man villain of the books it spends way too much time with him and his underground gang as well as the blind alicia these sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring the climactic struggle with doom his men starts fine but <UNK> into an awful mess as the torch races a laser <UNK> cool animation but <UNK> in a cartoon fans can have a laugh at the bad <UNK> fx and witless storyline if they don't get depressed <UNK> first
<START> just getting released from a six month drug <UNK> program and having served his time for dealing cards in illegal gambling card games frankie machine frank sinatra has high hopes for going clean and finding a new life as a big band drummer however upon returning to his old crime ridden chicago neighborhood he soon finds the pressure <UNK> from those around him including his wheelchair ridden wife <UNK> parker to return to the old money making dealer lifestyle that first got him started on the path of self destruction that is being an heroin addict br br it's very rare that a film has so many great character performances as this one does frank sinatra is superb as frankie machine and realistically portrays the <UNK> of a drug addict going through <UNK> arguably better than anyone else had ever been done before him sinatra seems to possess a keen understanding and awareness of his character here and expresses the constant battle for control over his own life that is forever going on inside the heart of the man that is frankie machine parker as his crippled wife wants to possess frankie forever to have him deal to make good money so as to take care of her and pay her ever <UNK> medical bills she seems terrified by anything she sees as a threat to her control over him such as the freedom the life of a drummer might offer or anything that might change the status <UNK> between them br br <UNK> molly kim novak a girl who lives in the same building and seems to possess real strong genuine feelings for frankie having no desire to control him but only to help him proves the best thing frankie has going for him in the world if he can just stay straight long enough to wake up and realize it darren <UNK> as the heroin drug <UNK> <UNK> however is always there just waiting in the wings knowing just the right buttons to push just the thing to say to get a former addict to <UNK> back to that old habit one <UNK> to <UNK> but deadly for the addict br br the setting too seems to take on a life of its own constantly dark gritty seedy and crime ridden with nowhere near enough positive things to look forward to in life a place where it's all too easy to escape via a bottle or drugs a quick fix that's truly no fix at all but only works to keep one in the dark away from the daylight and all the bright <UNK> the world might have to offer it's a neat touch that when frankie is on the right track the setting always seems <UNK> than when he's headed down the wrong road while some argue it is a bit dated to me this is a gritty film featuring a realistic inner war within a man for control over his own fate one that features very strong character performances by all involved given that the man with the golden arm gets my highest possible recommendation
<START> i never saw doctor who before at least not in any focused way so i was new to the concept i have to say that the new show works very well it's funny it really also ought to say comedy in the genre description many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value it's well written and it's making a <UNK> budget go a long way the human dimension is very strong and engaging which is very rare in current tv shows br br i've seen the first eight episodes and 6 8 were my favorites so far even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up with time travel saving one's dead parents and that sort of stuff works out amazingly well here br br christopher <UNK> is a joy to watch as the witty and light hearted though occasionally <UNK> doctor if they can find a good replacement for him i'll be quite surprised but i'm willing to give the new guy a chance there's little doubt however that the <UNK> episodes are going to go down in history as classics br br the relationship between the doctor and rose is particularly refreshing the doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them which however is much more emotional and human than sexual br br a good show the biggest <UNK> is the low budget a show like this ought to have better special effects and why they don't simply use some cheaper effects i don't know in this day and age <UNK> don't have to cost a <UNK> just look at the star wars revelations fan film br br 8 out of 10
<START> if i had to decide which was the best ernest movie and don't act like that sort of thing doesn't happen all time it would be this one br br all of the ernest movies are entertaining but the best ones are the ones that have jim <UNK> doing a number of different characters additionally i am known to enjoy the comedy <UNK> of bill and <UNK> <UNK> as brothers chuck and bobby <UNK> ernest goes to jail contains all of those elements as well as a funny script and a supporting cast that features several beloved character actors br br and that is why i have chosen ernest goes to jail as the king of all ernest movies disagree with me if you must but deep down you know i am right
<START> edith best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film i love it the film itself has gorgeous cinematography and fine <UNK> of the subject matter the ending is enough to have you in tears as it is so beautifully done lionel has directed some truly excellent films like the amazing mr but this is his best film as director by a mile the costumes were absolutely lovely that matched the beauty of the countryside and the <UNK> and conveniently faithful script helped matters however it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together as it is nothing shorter than incredible <UNK> sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother a much needed characteristic of the character and bernard <UNK> was hilarious as <UNK> in fact i preferred <UNK> on film as he isn't as humorous in the book the children were perfect gary warren and sally <UNK> both gave spirited performances but it is jenny enchanting portrayal of <UNK> that impressed me the most another special mention is the gorgeous music by johnny douglas the title music reminded me of charlie <UNK> smile in conclusion a funny and poignant masterpiece that is better than the book i think 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> this movie starts out with kids telling each other urban legends such as the <UNK> in the <UNK> and getting something extra at a chicken place unfortunately it then turns to your basic anthology movie the first being about a janitor with a bit of a secret this one is okay at best then it gets worse as the next story about this kid obsessed with dead flies is on and it goes on and on and on it is way to long and not all that interesting to begin with after that you get the typical shock scene and it ends you need more than this in an anthology movie you need at least three stories and one shouldn't be so long it becomes dreadfully uninteresting especially considering you can see how it is going to end a mile away
<START> this is an incredibly compelling story told with great simplicity and grace the story itself is the object of the film although the scenery is beautiful the acting is understated even superbly so for the characters themselves come through in all of their eccentric simplicity br br this piece of art will likely not be appreciated by those who view movies casually without due attention it takes work to be brought into the story but once you become involved the is complete
<START> the series finally hits rock bottom with this lousy fourth installment which was thank god the last one none of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the magnificent seven and <UNK> rousing music theme the production values resemble those of a made for tv movie and the characters are forgettable and <UNK> in parts ii and iii you couldn't remember their names here you can't even remember their faces lee van <UNK> was an inappropriate choice for the role of chris but nobody could have replaced <UNK> <UNK> in our minds anyway don't waste your time
<START> i really should have learned more about this movie before renting it it was one of those movies where you keep watching it <UNK> it's got to get better then when it ends you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back ice t did his bad guy thing and well that was the highlight of the evening the pictures of the <UNK> looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits the script was lacking and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because he drove better than i could have on one of my best days all in all i have seen worse but this sure isn't one i'd recommend or want to remember
<START> yep edward g gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world first he's an <UNK> <UNK> who sends the wrong man to the chair played <UNK> albeit briefly by <UNK> kelly then he's so filled with <UNK> his only <UNK> is the bottle throw in a jaded romance a genuinely rapid descent into <UNK> and no <UNK> about who he <UNK> and next thing you know black leg lawyer god i love that phrase he sees the light just in time to save his jaded beloved from the chair yawn br br but really the courtroom action is pure melodrama see him punch out a witness see him drink poison see him argue <UNK> as he <UNK> a bullet hole in his breast be prepared for melodrama br br the hoot of the film though is <UNK> russell with <UNK> <UNK> the laws of gravity and an iq approached absolute zero she is something to see even sings a bit
<START> over the years i seemed to have missed this picture of ronald reagan and due to his recent passing to the big screen in heaven it was shown on tv recently this is a great low budget b w film of the late 1930's however it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this particular time frame i was surprised at the role ronald reagan eric <UNK> the killer's played in this picture along with a great veteran film star sheila <UNK> nightmare circus '73 who was a great supporting actor it was a great film that showed ronald reagan as a very young man reaching for the stars in his career in hollywood at the time god bless him
<START> much like final fantasy if you look at a still shot it doesn't look so bad but when the people start moving it's utterly horrifying uneven jerky motions frightening lack of emotion and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps the characters do not even appear alive <UNK> br br i saw a preview screening with my daughter who actually fell asleep she was not at all engaged for the record i thought her to be easily engaged by both pixar <UNK> films as well as a number of the <UNK> <UNK> films like <UNK> br br the lighting is painful giving the children the appearance of holding a <UNK> under their <UNK> at a <UNK> the lip <UNK> is bad worse actually than final fantasy br br i also seriously question having hanks play five characters this was a major distraction throughout the film the role of the conductor is eerie although in a way i just can't <UNK> it reminds me of my father's fake phone voice when <UNK> <UNK> br br i think this is why the multiple roles are distracting you are aware that the voice is the same but yet distinctly different it gives each character the feel of being acted as opposed to being real human characters the illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of hanks i've seen the technique work a la eddie murphy but hanks just can't come close to pulling it off with a voice alone given the horrifying animation br br i would not waste my money on this wait for the rental
<START> star trek v definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the star trek series despite the good acting efforts by the actors it suffered from a general lack of funding from paramount pictures paramount pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very <UNK> br br the movie begins with the enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a for saving the earth from total <UNK> disaster their shore leave is cut short when a <UNK> occurs on <UNK> iii the planet of <UNK> peace captain kirk and the enterprise arrive at <UNK> iii only to have their ship <UNK> by <UNK> half brother the crew of the enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to <UNK> with god just past the great <UNK> at the center of our galaxy captain kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to <UNK> off the <UNK> br br the only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing william shatner leonard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> laurence and the rest of the cast all give good performances william shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film br br however the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding first the part of was initially offered to sean connery but he refused so laurence got the part second many of the special effects were severely cut back <UNK> the movies entertaining potential third the scene that depicts the arrival at the great <UNK> left much to be desired finally the romance between <UNK> and <UNK> in this film did not make much sense at all considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the star trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly <UNK> between star <UNK> iv and v br br overall this is a very weak film you should probably just skip this film and move on to star trek <UNK> after all the cast and crew made star trek <UNK> partly to <UNK> themselves out after their <UNK> with star trek v
<START> i am really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 or even more than a 2 it is full of bad lines bad acting bad slapstick etc i never thought i could see worse acting than the <UNK> badly acted scenes at the beginning of <UNK> but this was it and just when you think it can't possibly get any worse it does over and over again you actually could have watched this in a theater it wasn't worth free on tv my 4 year old and 1 year old liked it some but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on
<START> this movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and <UNK> those are the stress also given to the drama endured by <UNK> parents without for that reason <UNK> the hatred and desire of revenge they feel or <UNK> the horror that execution represents and the christian vision of all the questions implied we must also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other movies dealing with <UNK> which doesn't lead us to abandon the idea that a <UNK> execution is no more than a legal murder anyway last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the <UNK> shown by the last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so <UNK> as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed legal way
<START> this final installment of the airport franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy like airplane george kennedy shooting a <UNK> gun out an open window to <UNK> heat seeking <UNK> was comical what would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at <UNK> two speed you'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm the passengers were unintentionally hilarious as was the interior of the plane the sophisticated french woman coming on to <UNK> george kennedy was like jackie kennedy coming on to ernest <UNK> ain't gonna happen susan <UNK> a talented and <UNK> actress did not get any points on her resume for this one neither did robert wagner this movie was so lousy it seemed surreal
<START> i think that vanessa is the best actor in the cast she makes sam one of the best character on the show james <UNK> is also pretty good i love it when he worried about one of my favorite scenes in when ed and are beating the crap out of some guy that was funny <UNK> cox is also good and she has great chemistry with josh lara flynn boyle was awesome in her guest role i wish they hadn't killed her off the show has a great cast with no bad actors which isn't something you often see on tv i still think vanessa is the best though she should have got an emmy in my opinion it's a shame the show was cancelled
<START> the sole reason for someone wanting to see this film would be because of john <UNK> i remember the previews and it looked to be another second rate comedy but the fact that mr <UNK> starred tried to redeem it his name how known it was at the time or not tried to sell it br br i was pretty disappointed with the performance of <UNK> his days on house of an in living colour clone were his tip top there is a fine line between <UNK> and idiocy and we'll just say that <UNK> crossed it <UNK> he looked like he was trying to be too outrageous and crazy for the camera as a matter of fact i'll say that he tried too hard <UNK> humor <UNK> over into stupidity and the film was spoiled i can't say i blamed him if you were given this opportunity you'd try as hard if you could right your <UNK> cost you <UNK> though mr <UNK> br br the <UNK> follows in the tradition of any comedy film and plays the race card and more no group is left out from being <UNK> fun at blacks <UNK> whites jews <UNK> germans <UNK> and the blind are among those <UNK> out again here things get too overboard and too much tries to get <UNK> in too little time the resolution of the film takes all of five minutes to clear up and move back to <UNK> br br when you have a film and you're going to <UNK> plot and reality for <UNK> sake just make sure it's funny or all you have is 90 minutes of senseless film which would sum up <UNK> <UNK> quite nicely
<START> a holiday on a boat a married couple an angry <UNK> and a <UNK> is the reason to this films beginning br br i like boobs no question about that but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim my anger just rises to a whole new level take two guys a husband and another man put a pure <UNK> woman in the middle of them ad a deserted island <UNK> all her moral issues ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments fish and a <UNK> lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this br br the acting is i would say good there are some <UNK> but not many as far as i could see the main female character makes me sick this is due to her lack of moral values the man with the most fish <UNK> her attention even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being <UNK> with <UNK> the other man because i must do it to survive how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is away and he won't even benefit from it the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does if she <UNK> get <UNK> for her actions she's a victim br br i recommend everyone to see this movie this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience
<START> what can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man wrestling a garden <UNK> the acting particularly that of lead man jerry <UNK> is embarrassing the dialogue is so contrived and unfunny it makes you cringe the controlling idea is actually not a bad one for this genre <UNK> teen comedy but somehow the director manages to make the least of it i rate it a 2 out of 10
<START> i laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a <UNK> glance and you would think it was something else altogether i adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented these beautiful <UNK> gives us something else here shows us something i had not seen since his last film he is <UNK> exceptional and via his method of <UNK> the camera and allowing action to take place before us he opens the door on humanity and we <UNK> into a place that reflects our own lives our little lives it is powerful stuff it is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity everything in front of the camera is anything but simple attention to detail is extraordinary i believe most scenes if not all are sets built from scratch according to his designs i cannot recommend this film highly enough for me it took me to a place and i came out of it having witnessed a world <UNK> and beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and splendid at once alien and familiar this film is brilliant and life <UNK> i know because i came out smiling feeling wonderful it has taken him seven years to make this if he only made this one film he would still be up there with the <UNK>
<START> here is a <UNK> of a typical <UNK> ray show br br 1 the awful theme song begins to play and <UNK> <UNK> wearing her outfit in this bizarre <UNK> elevator 2 she begins running around screaming and or insulting the audience then yells at them sit down 3 an awkward monologue br br the next are in any order 4 a segment <UNK> own horn i e i lost 500 pounds with <UNK> <UNK> ray saved my life fashion <UNK> 5 a totally useless d i y tip i e how to words into <UNK> <UNK> how to use your <UNK> machine as a <UNK> <UNK> how to build a tube of <UNK> with a light on it 6 the <UNK> of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting audience reaction shots of first bites are never shown 7 a celebrity guest with an awkward interview followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience 8 a person who gets help from one of <UNK> i e the i say yes to everything woman the i own nothing but <UNK> lady and the i can't find time to put on makeup housewife what would they do without you <UNK> gasp br br reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague 1 <UNK> <UNK> ray claims that entire show is <UNK> many people who have attended of the show have claimed that the entire show is scripted many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show br br 2 her show jumps around too much where as oprah who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show jumps around like an <UNK> <UNK> child on crack her show <UNK> perhaps 10 short worthless segments a show on second you will be getting fashion <UNK> from and the next <UNK> will be making gross stuffed spanish <UNK> with cheese and the next their will be a giant <UNK> up on stage and the next well you get the picture br br 3 <UNK> is a poor host with bad ideas aside from her grating personality <UNK> ability is terrible at best her questions for her celebrity guests are poor and often times not even relevant to the interview and her segments are unappealing and offer little educational or humorous value br br in conclusion you need not waste your time with this schlock it will be canceled soon anyways
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> name is a nice inside joke this is the name of the former drug <UNK> who almost single <UNK> made marijuana illegal br br despite this bit of book knowledge the writers go on to have the <UNK> <UNK> and selling fresh <UNK> rather than <UNK> <UNK> br br additionally i always find it amusing that movie makers never seem to be able to find real marijuana plants for filming you would think there would be a business that would make real looking fake ones for the movie business or maybe they could film a couple of scenes in <UNK> or switzerland i suppose that's asking too much for the budget br br probably the most interesting thing about the film is the attempt to cover the notion of exactly what is right and what is wrong in society and how the law <UNK> that line and yet tries to do justice in spite of it br br
<START> cassie sandra <UNK> is a hyper serious police detective as an ex boyfriend once tried to kill her and indeed left her <UNK> wounded she is determined to bring those who harm others to justice as the result of her near death experience also cassie <UNK> one night stands and <UNK> no one one day a woman is found dead in the woods near <UNK> community she has been murdered <UNK> beaten severely and left to die alone naturally cassie will stop at nothing to find the murderers assigned to help her is fellow officer sam ben chaplin he soon discovers <UNK> relentless attitude and all <UNK> instincts when she asks him to pick up a <UNK> of vomit that has been left at the scene for analysis among other actions the trail soon leads them to two high school students richard ryan <UNK> and justin michael pitt could these teenagers really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect joy killing this is an intriguing film but viewers should be warned that the subject matter is grim indeed killing for the sport of it is seldom the topic of films that are of the all <UNK> and light variety and this one is no different that said the cast is great <UNK> without a hint of her talent for comedy is terrific as the police officer whose own past <UNK> her to lock up the evil folks of the world chaplin too is quite nice as the detective who is both attracted and <UNK> by the <UNK> cassie as for <UNK> he gives a most memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul the production values for the movie are good too with appropriately fine costumes settings and photography if you are a fan of <UNK> looking for a laugh this is not the one for you but if you adore mysteries even those with the <UNK> of plots you will find this tale enthralling
<START> when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd they had not viewed it on the silver screen my opinion remains the same the subject matter is <UNK> and the performances are weak
<START> sometimes you're up late at night flipping through the stations bored out of your mind and wanting some light and <UNK> romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel <UNK> and this movie fit that exact billing sure the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s the writing as <UNK> as the hallmark <UNK> card <UNK> legendary poetry and the one dimensional characters were played by a cast <UNK> straight from central casting but it was cute and exactly what i needed last night br br lauren holly and <UNK> <UNK> have great chemistry together i liked it on <UNK> <UNK> and i'm happy to say they still have it over 10 year later <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> is still possibly one of the <UNK> men to grace the screens since ol' <UNK> <UNK> kicked the bucket 80 years ago bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the roller <UNK> on that show about the cartoon lady i always thought he was something straight out of a hepburn grant comedy bravo br br some people will probably say this was the <UNK> piece of cinema ever made and i would probably have to agree but come on it's on the hallmark channel what were you expecting just sit back relax eat some <UNK> sticks and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of trust me you'll love and accept the <UNK> a whole lot more and then you can go to sleep dreaming about <UNK> <UNK> swimming in a sea of <UNK> chocolate feeding you <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> fresh chocolate <UNK> ps now i have a <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> thanks a lot hallmark br br i really wish the evil girl had been cast with rachel ray and maybe that <UNK> food nerd <UNK> brown as the <UNK> instead of the creepy dude with the van beard <UNK> br br that would have made my night but hey check out just <UNK>
<START> definitely not your typical redneck just never worked for me the movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process in their attempt to get away the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they <UNK> a plan to <UNK> the boy the plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to france and the boy is intent on staying with them while i could <UNK> a number of problems i had with the movie i'll focus on the most obvious  the character <UNK> played by telly <UNK> from his work in the dirty dozen and heroes to other italian films like crime boss to his most remembered role as <UNK> <UNK> was a winner i've always thought of him as one uber cool <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> is almost unwatchable in redneck did the director turn on the camera and <UNK> him to act as psychotic as possible it might not have been too bad had his actions been done within the context of a plot i cared about but here he seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre it's appears to be random <UNK> and what's with that accent <UNK> might have been a lot of things but southern isn't one of them he sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent beyond that i found little of interest in the rest of the movie as i <UNK> the plot never drew me in i just didn't care about what was going on and the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle doesn't ring true as for the other actors mark lester is almost as bad as <UNK> and the usually reliable franco <UNK> isn't a whole lot better three name actors and not a good performance between them to make matters worse i believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots i couldn't tell what was going on characters i hate a plot i don't care about and a production values that failed  little wonder i've given redneck a 3 10
<START> life is comprised of <UNK> possibilities some known others a mystery and destined to remain so and what of the vast unknown the <UNK> beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or <UNK> who is to say what exists or what is possible valid questions all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular <UNK> personal journey a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic in k <UNK> ' directed by and starring kevin spacey and jeff bridges in the wake of an incident in new <UNK> central station a man named spacey is transported to a psychiatric hospital in manhattan where he is delivered into the care of dr mark powell bridges who attempts to <UNK> the truth about his patient who claims to be from the distant planet k <UNK> it quickly becomes a challenge for dr powell as with his calm direct <UNK> manner and a <UNK> for produce he eats <UNK> <UNK> and all and red delicious <UNK> are his favorites is quite convincing but it's <UNK> job as well as his nature to be skeptical claims however remain intact and stand up even under the most intense <UNK> and the <UNK> eye of dr powell who finds himself in something of a <UNK> even tells him the exact date and time that he will <UNK> for k <UNK> a <UNK> return trip that allows powell but a short time to sort it all out and powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly if he is ever going to know the truth and he has to know the truth after all is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind br br has created and delivered a sensitive thought provoking film that challenges the viewer by <UNK> the mystery surrounding while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is in fact possible and as you never know for sure about until the denouement you are able to identify with powell seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the <UNK> right along with him creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that just may be what he says he is and in the context of the reality to which the film is <UNK> it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around how do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves while at the heart of the film there is a <UNK> depth of humanity that is evident not only in but in dr powell as well all of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama br br as we've come to expect kevin spacey gives a brilliant performance as presenting his character from the inside out emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time this is a unique individual and spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself for this film to work it is essential that we believe who and what is we do and it does spacey simply pulls it off <UNK> it's a memorable performance from which <UNK> a character that will stay with you for a long long time br br jeff bridges meanwhile emerges on equal <UNK> with spacey <UNK> making a very real person of dr powell it's a fairly straightforward role and the challenge for bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right which opposite the character of was no small task and again for this film to work it was necessary for bridges to rise to the occasion and with exceptional skill and being the <UNK> professional that he is he succeeds without question bridges <UNK> powell with an underlying complexity and is so giving in his performance that it makes the interaction between powell and vibrant and at times intense it's a <UNK> of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring it's a great job by bridges who never attempts to steal the spotlight from which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch br br the supporting cast includes mary <UNK> rachel <UNK> <UNK> dr ajay <UNK> dr vincent <UNK> scott <UNK> <UNK> ferrell betty and <UNK> williams ernie an entertaining emotionally involving film k is a <UNK> on possibilities as well as an examination of the ever <UNK> <UNK> of the human condition it's a film that demands an open mind and <UNK> those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it in the end it makes you realize just how real k <UNK> is and it makes you appreciate journey and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us human or alien and it may just make you reflect upon your own journey where you've been and where you're going and that's the magic of the movies i rate this one 10 10 br br
<START> i was fortunate to attend the london <UNK> of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive br br i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character br br alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler br br <UNK> knightley did a great job and <UNK> beauty and innocence from the screen but it was <UNK> <UNK> performance that was truly oscar worthy br br i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
<START> this movie would have been alright indeed probably excellent if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate into the void is a great song and i hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an <UNK> interview with <UNK> <UNK> that should have been at the end of the film or located in a special feature the best part of concert dvds is to put them on and let the music play but black <UNK> the last <UNK> is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted nevertheless there are a few strengths to this film the concert footage when it does play it excellent black <UNK> returns to the stage after a long <UNK> without <UNK> and this film captures that well <UNK> basically rocks the fans the fans of course have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live of course but also they do not have to put up with the <UNK> interviews that the dvd viewers are <UNK> with shame on <UNK> and monica <UNK> the directors for doing this to the film also shame on <UNK> smith for editing the film in such a way
<START> i love this movie and all aspects of it well directed as a comedy and as a drama the acting is tremendous performed by an all star cast who play the high society new york perfectly the scenery is incredible totally breathtaking i also love the story a successful nyc architect who is going through a <UNK> crisis leaves his cheating wife and runs off to a greek island to hide out with his daughter who chooses to go with him br br i just cannot express my love affair enough regarding this movie show me the magic
<START> this movie reminded me a lot of a song by the dead <UNK> called straight <UNK> however unlike this film the hero of the song turns to suicide you'll wish this <UNK> had <UNK> to killing himself instead of doing the crime he did the whole thing was convoluted and in the beginning you sympathize with the hero of the film then he quickly betrays your <UNK> the long sequences of just showing the hero's face while he delivers a monologue drag the film down quite a bit avoid this if possible
<START> this is a lame comedy br br here's why a man and wife sitcom okay br br the husband is a <UNK> bag the wife is the einstein br br how original is that br br jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld br br the gags are lame no witty one liners br br i have had enough stop this now br br the last word stupid the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc the worst part kevin james is actually a funny comedian he just isn't here <UNK> is great eye candy but is unlikeable wasted talent is the word bad sitcom
<START> ok so this film is not very well known and wasn't very well <UNK> i discovered this fairly brutal gangster gone good movie by complete accident on one of millions of movie channels late on some boring evening but i'm glad i did the opening sequence to this film is fantastically comical in a very dark way this in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movie i think a lot of critics and movie fans that have actually seen this film have been a bit unfair to just write it off as a lower budget gangster movie in the <UNK> dogs vein ok so there are <UNK> similarities between <UNK> and some other crime genre films that it has been compared to but in all fairness i think this film takes a much more darkly comic look at this type of film and the end result is a engrossing well made funny if not totally original film tom jane is good in this and deserves the recognition he will now hopefully get thanks to the the <UNK> his performance as the bad guy gone good is realistic funny and just cold enough to make you believe <UNK> really was a bad ass before he <UNK> thats another thing that makes this film stand out for me the characters in <UNK> gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembled a smooth charismatic but very cold leader nick a trigger happy blood loving sexually <UNK> bitch of a woman dallas and a psychotic hill billy with brains with a <UNK> for torture billy hill throw in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on screen beautifully over played by mickey rourke and you've got a recipe for well for <UNK> really its at times darkly comic sometimes brutal sometimes unoriginal but always engrossing and worth watching 8 10
<START> the next karate kid is a thoroughly predictable movie just like its predecessors its predictability often results in a feeling of <UNK> on the viewer's part who often wishes the story could move a little faster despite its <UNK> and its extreme <UNK> however this fourth entry in the series is <UNK> almost exclusively because of the presence of <UNK> he doesn't seem tired of his role and he does <UNK> some life and humor into the film becoming the best reason for you to see it not awful but nothing much either
<START> this is the movie that pretty much sounded the death <UNK> for the auteur in hollywood at over 40 million bucks <UNK> gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure what really me the most about it is that technically it's very bad an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it john <UNK> <UNK> speech at <UNK> is <UNK> as is a conversation between kris kristofferson and richard at the train station some people seem to think <UNK> intended this as a style he didn't it's just bad sound recording the characters are not particularly well drawn except for the four or five leads in the climactic battle scene it's difficult to tell who's the bad guys and who's the good guys even on that level it's impossible to enjoy the movie the casting of isabelle <UNK> as the town <UNK> is a joke her french accent <UNK> the whole character a fraud the acting is generally stiff without any range or depth of feeling even christopher walken is bad john <UNK> character is the only one with any <UNK> or <UNK> although hurt in his 40s playing a fresh faced <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> under his eyes is <UNK> ridiculous br br i guess to say that it's overlong is <UNK> the roller <UNK> sequence could have been easily cut the <UNK> scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the twilight zone having rod <UNK> appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale actually those scenes in and of themselves are not bad but <UNK> has not earned the right to include them because what he's given us as the meat of the picture is so <UNK> bad the editing is poor especially in the grand battle climax at one point the same explosion with the same <UNK> wheel flying from the blast is used three different times i wish could i say something anything nice about this movie a great scene a great performance even one memorable line of dialogue but i can't it is all just one big <UNK> mess about the only thing i did like was the cinematography and the montana locations which are stunning even <UNK> couldn't screw that up this is a long boring bad movie by all standards and the people who say that it gets <UNK> only because of the cost are just kidding themselves 1 2 out of 4
<START> i love john's work as a singer but the movie was dull and <UNK> worth the <UNK> to view br br i thought he did an <UNK> job at acting his part when he says your having an affair with the ol' man to his co star i kinda <UNK> at his facial movements or lack thereof br br i would suggest the movie if you like john's music but not as a saturday night video br br if you love his music then the video has a little music from him in it but not much br br so so at best
<START> this feels like a feature <UNK> treatment of a comedy routine that could have also been told in a ten minute short also technical credits are par the film really feels like a film school <UNK> project br br the cast is a mix of seasoned stage pros and talented <UNK> but the problems is the superficial <UNK> their lines feel constructed exactly like <UNK> tv show material br br the director fails to take his protagonists seriously therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts br br the film has been cleverly <UNK> and offers a unique selling point but in the end the film disappoints on all levels
<START> the material is poor the <UNK> dreadful the acting mediocre at best and the music <UNK> what the scene is supposed to be <UNK> like a kick in the head br br give this one a miss even <UNK> <UNK> not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe br br i'm amazed people rave about <UNK> butler given what i've seen here and in the couple of other things i've seen her in she hasn't got the depth or presence to be a star and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well br br last thing is where was this shot i don't <UNK> the <UNK>
<START> this movie was so poorly acted what was with jeff bridges accent horrible and unbelievable was it supposed to be french <UNK> the script was lame to have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the jeff bridges character are you kidding me how convenient that jeff brings his dirty <UNK> in the house after he <UNK> of bodies in his lawn do these people just not believe in calling the cops okay i'll get into the car with you why not duh why was daughter obsessed with making her dad have an affair is her mother that evil or just plain dull i did not see the original it would be hard to make myself after seeing this movie
<START> i picked this dvd up for 3 99 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free i never actually was planning on watching this but it started <UNK> at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the dvd player the effects in this movie are horrible and cheap some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy the acting is really cheesy in some parts and the action scenes are completely laughable you'll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained the plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some <UNK> has to get her to los angeles there are also two girls trying to <UNK> drugs there and a few other people that are <UNK> to the plot not that there really is a plot at all don't expect anything from this movie and don't listen to the cover there are not 100 passengers and 3 000 <UNK> there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes br br as for the dvd there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film a <UNK> reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train and the deleted scenes are really pointless if they weren't good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad there is also a really bad making of <UNK> which doesn't really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots i can't recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends i give it 2 kitty cats out of 5
<START> something not so great silence of the <UNK> remains <UNK> only good film and i'm of course including all the overrated left wing <UNK> in big screen <UNK> some of which i haven't seen and never will br br this is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere half way the first half is a little hard to sit through it's neither funny nor particularly interesting daniels plays an over the top dumb as dirt naive moron who is so <UNK> and <UNK> that it defies belief his animated acting is often annoying and barely funny he actually lies to griffith at the outset and tells her that he is married with children when in fact he is divorced in all the history of mankind and movies any man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie if he lies and say that he isn't married later on the not at all credible or believable <UNK> behind this was revealed he wanted to protect himself what a load of crap the fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the dumb things in the movie made me actually look forward to liotta <UNK> on him when he caught up with him in the <UNK> apartment br br what then happens in <UNK> apartment is the classic end of movie fight to the death which the good guy albeit the very dumb good guy predictably wins still at least the last half hour has some action something going on and daniels isn't given any more the opportunity to be animated the film lacks credible characters whether main or <UNK> and the feel of it is too 80s which means the movie has a rather bland look visually ugly <UNK> yet again makes a cameo as a policeman the film is also perhaps a bit too heavy on the <UNK> side griffith once again plays a soft talking dumb sounding bimbo but as usual she is convincing because she is a soft talking dumb sounding bimbo this was an earlier film before her lip <UNK> and breast <UNK> surgery compare the natural breasts she exposes in this film to the ready to explode <UNK> she briefly flashes years later in <UNK> fool br br if you're interested in reading my <UNK> of griffith and other hollywood <UNK> contact me by e mail
<START> i first watched this in black and white circa christmas in the early sixties when it was shown on british television i was absolutely hooked and watched it over again whenever it was repeated on tv possibly two or three times only as it happens if only we'd had video <UNK> then br br as <UNK> by other <UNK> the plot describes the return of the <UNK> after a period spent away to a forties american city he finds that all is not as he left it and his good <UNK> friends who live in the just outside the garden which belongs to a <UNK> and his wife are now under threat from the <UNK> who are <UNK> through the broken down fence which the property using it as a <UNK> br br <UNK> houses are being <UNK> by their feet and are also often burned by cast away <UNK> <UNK> and matches old mr <UNK> and his beautiful daughter honey childhood sweetheart are in grave danger of losing their honey shop to this threat br br to compound their problems <UNK> <UNK> c <UNK> beetle has romantic designs on honey <UNK> himself and hopes with the help of his henchmen <UNK> the fly and <UNK> the <UNK> to force <UNK> to give him her hand in marriage br br will the heroic and <UNK> win the day and manage to save the community of bugs from their <UNK> fate and especially his precious honey from hers enjoy the classic songs <UNK> did <UNK> didn't is a superb swinging upbeat example and the colourful visuals as the tale unfolds br br time has not <UNK> my fascination for this masterpiece of animation and story telling and i was much pleased to find that it had been released to video although i later found out that it was in <UNK> pal format never mind i sent off for the video immediately and only then bought a <UNK> tv video combination complete with <UNK> <UNK> br br i have enjoyed many nostalgic viewings since then and have even discovered that the tv rights have switched from bbc who informed me they were unlikely to ever show the film on any of their stations to <UNK> who have at last been showing it on their digital stations in early 2007 br br my <UNK> aged three was absolutely <UNK> while we watched it together and this is a child who has been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer generated productions br br i would thoroughly recommend this film for any age and especially the youngest of viewers br br give max <UNK> a <UNK> oscar
<START> wonderful movie adult content lots of erotic scenes plus excellent music and dance scenes my wife and i absolutely loved this movie and wish they'd make more like it
<START> i just caught farewell to the king on cable and maybe it's just because i'm a girl but i thought this was on the <UNK> side the script and direction are pretentious once i found out john <UNK> was responsible it all became clear the supporting actors actually weren't bad james fox was outstanding the biggest disappointment was nick nolte who i usually enjoy once he goes native he starts speaking a very stiff stilted english and half the time he seems kind of distracted as if he'd just <UNK> some of the bounty of rain forest and then the end what the just happens to be on the same boat as the <UNK> by the way had the <UNK> dumped the girlfriend or what the boat just happens to run conveniently close to an island <UNK> <UNK> by a crazy <UNK> ex army <UNK>
<START> poor shirley <UNK> tries hard to lend some <UNK> to this <UNK> gag inducing feel good movie but she's <UNK> by the run away sentimentality of a film that's not the least bit grounded in reality br br this was directed by curtis <UNK> did he have a <UNK> since we last heard from him <UNK> can do effective drama <UNK> with comedy as <UNK> by wonder boys so i don't know what happened to him here this is the kind of movie that doesn't want to accept that life is messy and <UNK> and that neat <UNK> endings however implausible they might be might make for a nice closing shot but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through br br my wife and i made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred e g the old man's going to teach her to read and then drop dead <UNK> this is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches <UNK> their emotional problems making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they're that aware of what's causing them toni collette a fine actress by the way and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them spelling out in flashing <UNK> the film's awkward connecting <UNK> at that moment i knew what i was in for and the film was a <UNK> spiral from there br br grade c
<START> this is a tedious movie the real villains are the clunky adaptation it's embarrassingly easy to tell that the source material was a novel and witless screenplay br br on the credit side considering the budget was tight due to wartime <UNK> the look of the film isn't at all bad and the performances are by and large ok except for <UNK> <UNK> who is terrific a miracle considering the potential for a pit into which she most definitely does not fall ms <UNK> with a lot less to go on is as accomplished as olivia de <UNK> in gone with the wind br br the one absolutely unbearable aspect of the man in grey is the dreadfully conceived depiction of a black serving boy no matter that he's meant to be a sympathetic character played badly by a white boy in black face make up it is impossible to by pass this example of condescending racism br br grim
<START> the performances by the male leads make this long hard journey west interesting throughout the soundtrack by the sons of the <UNK> is one of the most beautiful i have every heard the journey itself is somewhat episodic and <UNK> <UNK> is badly miscast overall this is a very heartwarming and heartfelt western
<START> watched this on with frank <UNK> commenting as i recall have never seen it since but would like to find out where it is available br br it is amazing how good something can be but be in black and white and have zero special effects in fact amazing how much better something like that is
<START> i've been watching attack of the show <UNK> for about 6 months maybe longer but not much i was very <UNK> with olivia and i found kevin to be very witty and the <UNK> between them very good lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me first my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called around the net that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like youtube that are generally funny or of people getting hurt inadvertently some intentionally <UNK> this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff i really haven't seen anything that good and i can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their <UNK> and being <UNK> so many times the show is like a late show wanna be <UNK> report wanna be with it's politics also if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal this humor gets old also <UNK> is old yeah yeah whatever <UNK> have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would <UNK> themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves so it's almost every show bash <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> so we get the same old of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some <UNK> political humor that never at itself out of it's own weakness i'll keep watching since i watch at work and it's all that's on hoping that i'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old i did like the fill in <UNK> of chris and alison though they were actually a good change of pace maybe this show could do a <UNK> host thing olivia who i thought at times in the beginning was really funny has <UNK> to this constant <UNK> response and it's getting old lol 7 of 10 it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger baby <UNK> like me mid 40's maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do there is a ton of stuff available they could use
<START> there is as many reviews have observed a strong dark streak to this movie the director it most recalls to me is john <UNK> yeah go ahead and <UNK> about what a <UNK> i am <UNK> has the gift of exploring <UNK> things in a bleak gray kind of way then turning round and exploring the horrors of life with a lighthearted touch br br the cast is without exception above average thomas gibson as david is outstanding as the moody and self <UNK> center around whom the rest of the characters <UNK> he talks a good <UNK> but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993 it was difficult to look at him and see greg <UNK> let alone agent of criminal minds br br perhaps not the best scene but the one i enjoy most my <UNK> scene is the section where candy is expecting a visitor and one <UNK> person after another shows up at the door as <UNK> <UNK> environment <UNK> further and further out of control david just grows <UNK> and more enthusiastic like a <UNK> gen x
<START> with such a promising cast and a director that i have heard great things about i was utterly disappointed by this film it started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes and yes i did watch the full length version i love robert deniro and as usual he did a fine acting job but in all his other gangster films no matter how many people he kills i always still had respect for his character but in this movie he was a <UNK> drug addict rapist with no care for anyone but himself also james woods another fine actor had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him i thought the parts where robert deniro called him crazy and he <UNK> out came completely out of left field and towards the end the writers just throw in this random comment about how his father died in a nut house and that's why james woods didn't like being called crazy so much was left undeveloped in this movie also we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill <UNK> and we never find out more about joe <UNK> character it seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them the only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids the story ran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job overall i was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and i don't see how anyone can even compare this to the godfather 1 and 2 or even <UNK> i am sad that i wasted four hours of my life watching this film
<START> louis khan was one of the most influential <UNK> of our time and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew his son's desire to find out who and more importantly what he was is moving and emotional br br this film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about what good design is and the emotional price that is paid for it equally haunting is the sound track if you see the film and then listen to the sound track you can <UNK> the film simply by listening as a practicing architect of over 30 years my heart <UNK> and <UNK> over the film and its very straight forward albeit emotional honesty and sincerity br br i had the honor of seeing this film <UNK> in chicago at the national convention of the american <UNK> of <UNK> the film was introduced by daniel and he was kind enough to do a question and answer session afterward during the entire presentation of the film not a sound not a <UNK> not one distraction took place the entire audience sat <UNK> and the real treat was <UNK> mother was present during the showing of the film br br i will always remember the film and play it over constantly in my mind every time i listen to the soundtrack
<START> warner brothers <UNK> considerably with american history in big trail director <UNK> <UNK> first rate western they died with their boots on a somewhat inaccurate but wholly <UNK> biography of <UNK> officer george armstrong <UNK> the film chronicles <UNK> from the moment that he arrives at west point academy until the indians massacre him at the little big horn this is one of errol <UNK> signature roles and one of <UNK> <UNK> greatest epics walsh and flynn teamed in quite often afterward and they died with their boots on reunited olivia de <UNK> as <UNK> romantic interest for the last time they appeared as a couple in seven previous films this <UNK> minute black white <UNK> is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences humorous romantic scenes and stern dramatic <UNK>

in fact the <UNK> was robert e lee as the earlier flynn film santa <UNK> trail showed another historical <UNK> concerns lieutenant general <UNK> scott scott was not the commander of union troops throughout the civil war warner brothers presented <UNK> as a <UNK> probably because flynn had a reputation for drinking but in real life <UNK> neither <UNK> nor <UNK> nevertheless these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film br br they died with their boots on opens with <UNK> riding into west point military academy in a fancy dress uniform with an african

<START> masterpiece <UNK> top blows the screen away never has one movie captured the essence of the human spirit quite like <UNK> of the board 10 10 don't miss this instant classic
<START> that is the answer the question is what is the single reason to watch this movie i loved her in my name is julia ross that is one of the best films noir of all time noir or whatever one may call it it's a very unsettling movie br br she is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time too that would be the guilt of janet <UNK> this one has a spooky promising title it has a good cast it has a fine director i was expecting something dark maybe something a little <UNK> instead it's an uninspired routine espionage movie it's pretty much is a total bore at least it was to me ms <UNK> is captivating and that is about it
<START> the golden door is the story of a <UNK> family's journey from the old world italy to the new world america <UNK> a middle aged man who hopes for a more <UNK> life <UNK> his family to leave their <UNK> behind in <UNK> take the <UNK> journey across the raging <UNK> and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk in short they believe that by <UNK> everything for the new world their dreams of <UNK> will be <UNK> the imagery of the new world is optimistic clever and highly imaginative silver <UNK> rain from heaven upon <UNK> as he <UNK> how <UNK> he'll be in the new world <UNK> and <UNK> twice the size of human beings are shown being <UNK> to suggest wealth and health and rivers of milk are <UNK> in and flow through the minds of those who <UNK> what the new world will <UNK> all of this imagery is <UNK> with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the <UNK> people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the new world br br the voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness especially when the <UNK> <UNK> and nearly kill the people within the dark reality i referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world the old world is depicted as somewhat <UNK> and primitive this is shown as <UNK> <UNK> together to sell what few <UNK> he has left <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world i thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to <UNK> to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their <UNK> and setting <UNK> for the new world this shot shows an <UNK> view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another depicting the <UNK> between the old and new worlds this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were <UNK> to enter a world that held more promise br br as later <UNK> to how the new world visually looks the old world seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet <UNK> new world i thought it was particularly interesting that the statue of liberty is never shown through the fog at <UNK> island but is remained hidden i think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to <UNK> the purpose of what the statue of liberty stands for give me your poor your tired your hungry seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the new world once they arrived in the <UNK> they had to go through rather <UNK> <UNK> i e <UNK> <UNK> etc in order to prove themselves as fit for the new world these <UNK> completely changed the perspectives of the <UNK> people in particular mother had the most difficult time <UNK> herself to the rules and laws of the new world feeling more <UNK> than treated with respect where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would provide the reality of what the new world required was <UNK> and rude <UNK> doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually was seemed disappointing to him this attitude was shared by mostly everyone who with him their character <UNK> deal more with a <UNK> dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted br br the film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing <UNK> to enter a heavenly and <UNK> society <UNK> marriage and intelligence are <UNK> <UNK> to these rules is to prevent disease <UNK> behavior and stupidity from <UNK> perhaps this is a commentary on how america has learned from the <UNK> of other nations and so was <UNK> established to secure that these <UNK> did not <UNK> and <UNK> though the rules seemed rigid they were there to protect and help the people <UNK>
<START> in comparison to other sand and <UNK> fare the egyptian leaves much to be desired the film is very loosely based upon well <UNK> novel which centers around the egyptian <UNK> adventures at the court of as well as his travels throughout <UNK> <UNK> and africa unfortunately due to the moral <UNK> of the time much of story which is <UNK> with romantic and sexual exploits remains on the cutting room floor and instead the audience is treated to <UNK> and <UNK> of victor <UNK> wooden acting even gene tierney  a leading lady <UNK> of the time  can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather <UNK> performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time there is a great deal of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> over the idea of <UNK> vs but michael <UNK> is so <UNK> as the revolutionary that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and <UNK> the old religion before the second reel my advice buy the book from e bay rent something more entertaining like <UNK> and <UNK> and then call it a night
<START> in the book of life martin <UNK> plays jesus who shows up at <UNK> airport on december <UNK> to <UNK> in the new millennium by battling with thomas jay ryan satan and deciding the fate of the world there is also david kurt the <UNK> from amateur as a <UNK> homeless <UNK> br br as usual hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and <UNK> flows through <UNK> framed scenes and urban industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow as usual he introduces seemingly incidental details early then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected <UNK> the humor is simple but <UNK> and <UNK> hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and <UNK> moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous as usual he creates a tone that is jaded and world weary but at the same time vulnerable open and honest he moves within minutes from <UNK> humor into language that is <UNK> and poetic the kind of writing that is so dead on and perfect that it's difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion another awesome and highly entertaining film the book of life is shot a digital camera with a <UNK> effect a sense of the <UNK> hand in hand with impending doom and a hyper awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments all of hartley's films have a way of the present but this unique effect <UNK> it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it the final shot is spectacular all this may sound precious but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of <UNK> judgment day and ' although it is actually quite profound moving and life <UNK> it is for the most part lighthearted and playful the acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that hartley has developed in his films a tone that some people don't get and that <UNK> them to judge such acting as hollow the same people who have a negative response to peter <UNK> as always there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and <UNK> people put off by hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or techniques but who has time to consider the opinions of such dull and <UNK> fools anyone who is a hartley fan will love this film if they can get a chance to see it that is it's hard to say what it would be like on video
<START> love and human remains directed by <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> pathetic film as it is completely different from the kind of films he has been making all through his career making a different film is not an <UNK> matter what is <UNK> is the fact that if a film from a master is complete out of tune then it is a really bad event the film begins on a good note as there is some suspense created however as the film progresses what is shown is just a <UNK> attempt at creating something meaningful as <UNK> shows us half a dozen oddball whimsical characters whose lives are <UNK> with each other homosexuality and <UNK> are not of any consequences here what is even more <UNK> is the feeling of guilt related to the characters who are rather in a fix regarding their feelings towards each other and sexuality such a film would be of interest to some who wants to see a different <UNK> <UNK> film all in all there would surely not be many <UNK> for this film
<START> i have nothing but praise for this movie and cast especially ann margaret but more importantly i have praise for my in laws who were are the <UNK> parents of warren and frank in real life i met most of the children at <UNK> wedding in 1989 this is an amazing story and is even more incredible to me knowing the family and what everyone went through it is also enjoyable for me to see how my in laws were portrayed in the movie it was pretty accurate my wife even enjoys seeing some little details such as a <UNK> that she remembered from her childhood yes it is a hard movie to watch but so amazing and heartfelt br br the beauty of this story for me is how many of the children passed through my in laws lives and as a result of marrying their daughter and having warren as a brother in law how many i have met in mine for the past 20 years this story has been a part of my life because of what my mother in law has shared with me that and knowing warren for what it is worth warren lives in california with his family he married his high school sweetheart who he with at his 20 year high school reunion br br there was a show in the 1980's called that's incredible they had a reunion of the family who also got to meet the cast of the show br br for anyone's interest the dvd is available in great britain and australia it is a tough video to come by here in the united states and i have not been able to find a dvd here yet
<START> it's hard and i didn't expect it but it's really the worst film me and my wife saw awful dialogs that <UNK> <UNK> through time without any apparent reason except to fill time the storytelling doesn't follow a <UNK> <UNK> everything is a mess the action and the dialogs appear at jumps the thing that disappointed me most was to see <UNK> one of my french favorite actors involved in i don't even know how to describe it without being the rest of the actors where at the most poor susan made a terrible interpretation of her character making a flat <UNK> performance poor special effects i don't think that it was a complete waste of film but it's close if i'm to say i would advise everyone not to see this movie i think it would be a complete waste of time sincerely i never though i would say something like that about a movie there's always a first time
<START> you know those films that are blatantly awful but you can't help but love them well that's what evil ed is possibly the best awful film in the world the sound is rubbish the dubbing is crap the screenplay is nonsense and the special effects are <UNK> however i can't help but love this film <UNK> and i have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years sam campbell or the guy who plays him should be featured on the actor's studio series as he is that memorable possibly the greatest movie villain not named tony montana seriously if you don't expect a lot then you won't be disappointed keep a light hearted approach to watching this film and you'll soon rate it a ten afterwards
<START> being a middle aged mom myself i very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us br br diane lane beautifully portrays <UNK> and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through wanting to do what is right for her children but still have a happy life herself br br i am not a big richard gere fan but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk but learns something about himself br br criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies when nicole kidman and hugh jackman fall in love riding across australia with barely a conversation between them its considered high romance we get so much more here with she <UNK> him he sets her free its beautiful br br the <UNK> they create by sharing their deepest <UNK> fans into a flame of passion how long it takes is irrelevant perhaps the movie was a bit too subtle in the point that it was the letters they shared over the following year that <UNK> their relationship again another real life time <UNK> way to get to know a person br br as much as i enjoyed the plot and themes the dialogue was not consistent in quality some lines <UNK> so true and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat br br i also enjoyed the relationships with <UNK> teenage daughter and her best friend reminding us that there are many types of love not just romantic love br br this is not a lighthearted romantic comedy more a romantic drama it does have a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow br br the beach house is a work of art fabulous look for the <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> in the first pan over the house very beautiful i also enjoyed the music and scenery which combined to create the effect of the location as being the third main character it was this place away from their regular lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light br br if you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood for a good cry get out the <UNK> and enjoy this movie
<START> couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door if they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die do they push the button br br this is an odd film based on a richard <UNK> short story has a few chills but mostly is a messy affair the trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director richard kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones at times it seems like it with talk of moral choices <UNK> and the <UNK> is it a science fiction film possibly there are lots of questions about that mars project and what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy is this invasion of the body <UNK> or a demonic take over film don't know maybe and that's the problem there are lots of questions most of them intriguing but there are too many little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude even in an open ended way i'm all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer kelly fills his script with simply too many that director kelly can't handle or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit it made me crazy i won't get into the two leads cameron diaz and james <UNK> who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting br br it's a <UNK> mix that doesn't work there are ultimately too many holes i got to the end and suddenly realized i had no idea what i just saw i really didn't like it but its more in a this isn't good because it just misses sort of a way rather i'd take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything
<START> i was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews this has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me <UNK> to watch it br br the concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on american idol you watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings but we knew this movie didn't have bad actors so how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an american idol <UNK> it would be pointless as this movie was br br the use of <UNK> is over rated we've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes i feel that is <UNK> <UNK> can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves if you like that drew carey <UNK> show of <UNK> you'll probably like this film br br overall the jokes were poor the <UNK> was <UNK> and the over acting by guest and company was campy and those are my <UNK> of this drivel if a guy playing a <UNK> and the <UNK> drum at the same time is funny to you fine for me i prefer more <UNK> stuff like i love lucy or <UNK> <UNK> br br but remember i think snl lost its humor in the 1980's so maybe you'll like this g rated humor i kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the <UNK> keeper and then tell us there was no <UNK> in town that's the humor you can expect br br my only wish was that i could give this a minus rating
<START> i have officially <UNK> in my own mouth thanks to this movie br br i expected the absolute worst with this movie but i expected a heartwarming and <UNK> absolute worst this is just terrible absolutely terrible terrible like nazis <UNK> the black plague let me explain ewoks are speaking english it's horrible br br the villain girl looks like she <UNK> from the future set of power rangers i really really want her to rise up from the ground and say at last after ten thousand years i'm free it's time to <UNK> earth the er i mean the big bad whatever the heck they are they <UNK> a lot many of them look like an even <UNK> version of the <UNK> the <UNK> was pretty cool but these guys were not br br the only merit to this movie was paul <UNK> this movie might have been better if he'd went to the bad guys and said if i have to come in here again i'm <UNK> it would have been even better if one of the ewoks was played by judd nelson who mouthed his words as he said this br br also that <UNK> little creature is pretty <UNK> word to that br br no word to the movie though i want to give this movie a two i want to so badly there's a passage i have <UNK> the path of this movie is <UNK> on all sides by the <UNK> of <UNK> and the <UNK> of spin off awfulness blessed is nothing for this movie blows
<START> when i checked out the review for this film after i'd watched it i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings br br this is a film of bad camera work everything happens off screen usually accompanied with a <UNK> of someone yelling did you see hear that well no we didn't see that we can't and when there weren't any close ups the camera was doing something weird like <UNK> upside down or shaking back and forth really really quickly to either convey action or to make us physically sick br br the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes they started screaming the same thing over and over again i don't care if that's what it would <UNK> be like i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things i expect <UNK> things like aliens demons or good acting they were stupid too let's go have intimate relations in a cave with all of our clothes on speaking of which the ending somewhat <UNK> what <UNK> said immediately before he died this <UNK> me a bit though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a serious invasion of one girl's <UNK> br br no plot no climax no good acting terrible camera work what's left oh right the ending may have had a <UNK> but generally with horror movies the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film sixth sense does it explains a lot hide and seek did too but the <UNK> had a lame twist that served as an if you could call it that as it doesn't explain anything br br don't see it please
<START> here's why this movie fell very short of its potential i don't read much so i don't care what the novel was like 1 i think brendan <UNK> copied his <UNK> man from <UNK> tarzan it was stiff and while his tarzan call was a little more realistic he had no humanity 2 they screwed with the story maybe that's how the book goes but for as long as i can remember the first <UNK> of tarzan were me tarzan you jane jane is the first human tarzan encounters i did like the natives a bit more than the midget in <UNK> version but those <UNK> and <UNK> were a bit cheesy 3 tarzan is primarily a love story i'm sorry but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture that qualifies her for a supporting role at best supporting roles and leads don't fall for each other not enough screen time sorry not only was <UNK> <UNK> over pathetic most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked the chemistry scale between tarzan and jane was a <UNK> 0 i never believed they loved each other which made the <UNK> <UNK> closing voice over quite frankly silly when tarzan sees jane for the first time in the jungle he feels an urge if you will a feeling he's never felt before jane brings out the humanity in him and he brings out the <UNK> side of her its this chemistry that the story of tarzan not that lord dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him even a good face lift couldn't help this movie it needs massive internal <UNK> oh and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place final judgement 4 out of 10 sorry tin man and by the way if you want to see real acting drop <UNK> and check out <UNK> <UNK>
<START> pathetic <UNK> crap appeal to all who are not this is the worst of indian cinema made by the worst piece of <UNK> trash the story is boring and clichéd the way <UNK> and <UNK> view india go for it if u want to be bored to death br br the movie deals with the plight of <UNK> in india before independence a lot of it is true even now in remote rural areas but not to the extent as depicted maybe because its a period movie br br there are plenty of other indian movies directed by extremely talented directors that are worth <UNK> this one is a definite miss watch a documentary instead or look up information on the net if you are genuinely interested in the plight of the <UNK> in india br br i wasted my time
<START> this is a very very very bad movie br br the plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse br br the special effects are unconvincing the dramatic scenes are a joke every step of the way you can see coming a mile away the end is disappointing and there is no suspense the best aspect of the film is the soundtrack br br the only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a tv movie and i believe the budget was low to start of with br br i do believe that the young female fans of luke <UNK> will still see this movie however he has done better work again this is terrible very very very terrible if you have a choice look at something else
<START> one of the best western movies ever made unfortunately it never got the recognition it deserved the storyline the action and the music was in my mind one of the best i give it a double a randolph scott gave a terrific performance along with the other members of the cast the ending was one of the best of any western made
<START> take a bad script some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get something that is supposed to pass for quality family viewing br br seven alone is the story of a family in the 19th century who travel across america in a <UNK> train hoping for a new life in <UNK> there are seven children three boys three girls and a baby whose sex i'm not quite sure of hence the title of the film br br the story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere <UNK> son john is a <UNK> teenager and good for <UNK> as his father constantly reminds him we see right off the bat that he has a <UNK> for practical jokes when he ties string to the hair of his sleeping sisters and <UNK> it to a nearby <UNK> when the <UNK> is moved of course the poor girls are <UNK> out of bed john is caught by his father and is immediately <UNK> with a <UNK> br br that same day a <UNK> train passes through <UNK> is tempted to join up as it promises a new life in the wild wild west so the family <UNK> up their <UNK> and head off br br from the very beginning the film seems weak and amateurish the acting is below grade as if from one of those films shown in school about the <UNK> i can't blame the actors however because the lines in this film are silly and just too <UNK> sweet and optimistic br br i must tell you that i caught this film while flipping channels one boring saturday afternoon on a christian television station not of a religious mind myself i watched in horror as seven alone offered up moral statements that were not only outdated but downright offensive if i were a good christian i would hope that i would have had the good sense to complain to the television station for airing such trash however because i am a cynical non believer with a wicked sense of humor i chose to sit back and laugh myself silly br br in one of the opening scenes the role of the father as the stern <UNK> of the house is established when he <UNK> the idea of heading off for <UNK> to his wife her response is a <UNK> over my dead body we are expected to laugh i suppose as the film cuts to the next scene with <UNK> and ma smiling as he <UNK> the <UNK> along through the <UNK> oh i suppose even the most <UNK> feminist would have to admit that this <UNK> knows <UNK> attitude was the norm in those days and one could argue the need for such <UNK> rule when living conditions were difficult but i somehow got the feeling that this film supported that notion even for today lovely message coming from a christian television station br br anyway things get worse for the family and the films moral integrity is further <UNK> an indian or native american <UNK> john as he lay sleeping in a field like a common savage the indian takes <UNK> clothes and <UNK> thankfully <UNK> with the help of <UNK> carson is able to kill the indian as well as a couple of his <UNK> friends <UNK> carson tells john that his father is a true hero br br the family is accompanied by the <UNK> <UNK> resident doctor dr dutch played by <UNK> ray he shares sentiments about john stating that he is a useless brat perhaps so but he also the best thing about this film <UNK> <UNK> doctor is <UNK> who seems unable to tie his own shoes let alone treat one of the girls for a broken leg thankfully the young child didn't cry when the <UNK> ran over and <UNK> her leg in two because dr dutch didn't seem to have the appropriate <UNK> manner we know the <UNK> of constantly <UNK> a child here's a film that <UNK> that behavior br br later on <UNK> develops food <UNK> or something i wasn't paying much attention and he dies his death bed scene is the stuff great acting is made of frankly the man didn't even look sick br br soon after ma dies too the children are left to <UNK> for themselves and that's when the real adventure begins <UNK> it through the <UNK> <UNK> more indians these ones are nice though and <UNK> through snowy <UNK> these children do it all and i was left thinking what a bunch of garbage br br sorry but there was nothing redeeming about this film this low budget little house on the <UNK> is a shameful waste of time and an insult to everywhere i'm surprised that in 1975 at the tail end of the feminist movement and at a time when treatment of native americans was coming into focus that something like this could actually be made br br
<START> the film has no connection with the real life in <UNK> in those days should be more realistic and shows the viewer real <UNK> that were happening to common people during the war please see some films of <UNK> authors <UNK> kusturica e g <UNK> a barrel of <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> <UNK> and me gore beautiful <UNK> burn beautiful etc just this is the real way to know about so called <UNK> problem hollywood is definitive not <UNK> right address to make films about the <UNK> <UNK> maybe vietnam <UNK> ii but not of the living in former <UNK>
<START> a friend of mine decided to rent this thing lucky it wasn't my money pretty much wasted my time though a story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing directing maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird over acting gary <UNK> character for example all the over acted characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting as they grabbed your attention for all the wrong reasons obviously where the movie in itself failed miserably in short a waste of time and money br br 2 10
<START> if i didn't know any better i would have thought <UNK> was made in the late 80's early 90's when crap sold as film in hollywood br br i don't understand why people like christopher <UNK> he speaks like he's reading off of cue cards and turns into a <UNK> whenever he has to <UNK> he was easily the movie's weakest aspect the other actors were ok nothing horrible br br it's easy to see where the majority of the budget went the special effects the killings look pretty professional but hardly make up for the film's <UNK> br br i wouldn't go as far as to say <UNK> is a <UNK> copy of <UNK> but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it <UNK> on a religious minded murderer on a modern <UNK> the detectives investigating his work have to rely on bible <UNK> and christian history to piece together the killer's puzzle <UNK> however is <UNK> of <UNK> clever storytelling cinematography acting well everything that makes it good instead <UNK> lies to the audience and uses the scooby doo method of mystery to surprise it br br in conclusion <UNK> was about as bad as i expected it to be i almost feel bad for <UNK> this movie since i knew it would be bad going in but sue me
<START> i'm not sure what <UNK> me about this movie so it is grainy poorly written <UNK> out often ridiculous and at many points mind numbingly dull the person i was watching it with fell asleep twice and yet there is something in this film that <UNK> me though i am not sure what perhaps the character of sam an enormous former patient who was by the former head doctor and who is <UNK> sucking on an ice pop or the <UNK> played head doctor i forget her name br br anyway watch it and form you're own opinion it has one of the greatest endings i have seen in film
<START> roy has managed to craft something that defies nearly all conventions of what a film should be a piece of art that is both beautiful funny and <UNK> at the same time the end result is a moving if somewhat <UNK> tale about humanity in its <UNK> and most honest forms br br this is unlikely to appeal to everyone in fact the humour is so finely tuned that many are unlikely to get on its <UNK> the almost <UNK> long takes awkward <UNK> and consistent medium shots will most definitely put off even the most willing of audiences but it is within these disjointed tales and unconventional thinking that <UNK> a world where every character seems to take centre stage in their own absurd way each scene is absorbed by the desolate <UNK> with the characters seemingly left alone in their own <UNK> its a difficult piece to watch at times not least because like many of its scenes it requires patience but whilst some may <UNK> it upon an artistic throne others will simply look on in confusion its a film that <UNK> understated humour with own brand of heart
<START> <UNK> massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the <UNK> party massacre series if that's what they were doing which it is considering one actress from the original returns in a small cameo role they have failed miserably and made by far the worst installment of the <UNK> massacre <UNK> combines bad acting a horrible plot a dumb killer dull and boring deaths boring scenery and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made did i already mention how bad it was don't get me wrong this cheesy and retarded excuse for a horror film is nowhere near as bad as <UNK> dynamite but it is undeniably a horrible movie br br <UNK> massacre is an exact polar opposite of the original <UNK> party massacre stay away by all means this movie is utter garbage
<START> i was hooked in by the premise that the show was about demons from hell and a <UNK> to hell what i didn't realize was that i would be watching some guys run around <UNK> chased by small children who may may not have been demons for the entire movie sure there was some dialogue in between and great underground scenery but the lack of a plot developed characters any twists or development in the story at all was sorely lacking oh and out of interest there were no special effects the entire budget was spent on actors <UNK> sets and lots of time running around with a camera underground br br the ending was one of the typical lackluster boring endings that makes you say i endured this film of boredom for that if you want to see demons and a <UNK> to hell i promise you that you would be better off served watching the trailers to the game london which while shorter than this movie at 5 minutes pack more dialogue character development action plot and satisfying conclusions than this br br the second star is for effort but overall a low score for failing to make a movie that stands out and for promising in the <UNK> much more than what was delivered
<START> when one stops to <UNK> upon the frequent on screen <UNK> of errol flynn and olivia <UNK> they died with their boots on 1941 is most likely the film remembered best it is the sweeping saga of general <UNK> flynn told from the time he enters west point military academy and falls for the <UNK> elizabeth bacon <UNK> through his <UNK> during the american civil war and finally with his death at little big horn director <UNK> walsh <UNK> his historical epic on the <UNK> of highly questionable of historical <UNK> <UNK> by screen writers <UNK> kline and <UNK> until truth and fiction are <UNK> all out of <UNK> hence the battle against chief crazy horse anthony quinn is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians california joe <UNK> <UNK> and a absent corporation which wants to <UNK> the land <UNK> gave to the indians through the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> first peoples br br flynn who cleverly plays <UNK> as though he is one part arnold to two parts albert has never been more <UNK> he literally <UNK> charm and sex appeal from every <UNK> that easily <UNK> the heart of his loyal heroine resident warner stock players arthur kennedy and sidney <UNK> deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them br br overall then despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn they died with their boots on is ample film fodder for a saturday <UNK> or sunday night with one's sweetheart <UNK> dvd is pretty nice looking although film grain is often obvious the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep solid blacks and very clean whites some <UNK> is obvious during scene transitions the audio has been very nicely <UNK> up and is presented at an adequate listening level
<START> the plot of sally of the <UNK> is the usual melodramatic stuff an orphan <UNK> to <UNK> but the film rises above most <UNK> thanks to three people br br this is not of course d w <UNK> masterpiece but it does showcase his film making <UNK> in full maturity he uses all his <UNK> which are techniques we take for granted now close ups cross cutting a mobile camera and the ability to <UNK> acting from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic subtlety br br w c fields also showcases his skills not his signature gruff delivery but his remarkable <UNK> as a physical comedian he does a few inventive <UNK> acts cut too short to be fully appreciated and some very <UNK> <UNK> but it seems that every prop that comes within reach gets manipulated for comic effect hat <UNK> car roof dog cash he's a joy to behold br br finally there's carol <UNK> much has been said against this actress but her performance here is also richly comic she was 22 at the time playing a teenager and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and <UNK> that may not be wholly convincing but she truly <UNK> the eye when she's on screen particularly when she's dancing she's not a beauty though she's positively <UNK> in the one scene where she's <UNK> up like a <UNK> sister but her <UNK> only adds to <UNK> character especially in the many moments when she shows very obvious affection for fields as her guardian father few if any hollywood performers could compete with fields when it came to comedy but griffith gives his leading lady every chance to match her co star and <UNK> absolutely holds her own
<START> if you suffer from insomnia then <UNK> would be the best way to send you into a 7 year coma the film is so <UNK> overwrought and mundane that it's hard to imagine that director steve could overlook such obvious <UNK> br br the story has an <UNK> doctor who we never get to see move out into the desert to create a <UNK> that will cure all <UNK> by filling the <UNK> full of <UNK> that can combat any <UNK> yes just like that episode of <UNK> the don't work and the human guinea pigs become infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours br br not wanting to be caught by the government guys in masks the group head into the desert for cover hoping that the sunshine will kill the virus all of this is narrated by michael the only one of the <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> and it's the most boring narration ever they could have cast someone with an interesting voice but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than clive owen br br on top of this the editor insists on fade cutting more than half the movie giving it a weird dream like feel and increasing the audiences desire to go to sleep it's no surprise that half of the audience walked out of this i was not one of them for some reason but i bloody well should have br br the ending is supposed to be shocking and clever and foreboding but it's plain and simply not a relief yes but not dramatic in the slightest br br the utter <UNK> of this production and <UNK> sound that <UNK> a lot of the dialogue <UNK> <UNK> what could have been an interesting sci fi story if it had better actors <UNK> locations and a sense of urgency as it is <UNK> is a <UNK>
<START> hit and run is a shattering story starring the always wonderful margaret colin as a society lady who has it all until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene hence the title the tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns but is frightened away by angry <UNK> by who think the <UNK> abandoned the scene this was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story br br <UNK> guilt and anguish are <UNK> and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self loathing hole causing her to make a bad situation worse br br this is a very thought provoking story and one can't help but to feel this <UNK> pain wishing throughout that she would simply come clean br br as a tv movie thanks to colin and a strong script this is a well above average tv movie
<START> when it was released this film caused a sensation i watched it and was thrilled beautiful usually young naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director <UNK> photography his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie today i saw it again and was <UNK> disappointed the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes all filmed with some <UNK> on the <UNK> actually is all there is there is no real story the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies but they are not real creatures with a soul actually nothing happens it is like hamilton is <UNK> using moving pictures rather than stills and this gets so boring after a while i even didn't watch the whole thing the second time for i fell vast asleep that is all that remains of this masterpiece it is a very good sleeping <UNK> and you will never become addicted to it br br back then 7 out of 10 now 3 out of 10
<START> alfred hitchcock's remake of the man who who knew too much is usually not considered to be as good as the original but for me it is one of the best films ever i prefer it over vertigo and rear window br br like north by <UNK> it is the story of an average man who is <UNK> thrown into the world of international intrigue james stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy he will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family br br while the original was good for it's time it is hard to watch by today's standards the remake has excellent production quality an endearing doris day and a really creepy villain br br don't bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over
<START> i watch this movie every time it plays on tv a simply brilliant film three men return home from war and try to return to <UNK> life with great difficulty all three led opposite lives during the war executive <UNK> became an army <UNK> a <UNK> jerk became an air force captain and the high school football hero loses both his arms in battle and now each must <UNK> his life and connect with a new reality the homes they return to with grown children and independent working women along with a depressed economy only add to the <UNK> it's the scenes just off camera and the <UNK> dialog which <UNK> the most <UNK> however the awkward <UNK> of <UNK> march and myrna loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader both at home and at work are heartbreaking br br dana andrews is riveting as the handsome <UNK> captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform br br the film is filled with honest characters and each is portrayed by a gifted actor br br this film however took on a whole other level after seeing saving private ryan the reality and <UNK> of what these men lived through for love and country and obviously it didn't end on the battlefield br br this is an essential for any collection br br
<START> without a doubt the most impressive recent gay oriented film i've seen c jay cox hit the nail on the head with this one the way he handled the issues surrounding faith family and sexuality were very well done casting was perfect wes <UNK> did a fantastic job at pulling off the character of christian and steve will knock your <UNK> off in the role of aaron both brought an incredible amount of realism to the roles and the <UNK> these issues have on young gay men as a gay man who grew up in a very religious environment though not mormon the <UNK> with <UNK> character was phenomenal for me strongly recommend this film to anyone faithful or not who is interested in how young gay men have to deal with family and friends in an <UNK> times <UNK> world by the way the music in this film rocks another great job by c jay cox
<START> they made me a criminal is a remake of an earlier warner brothers film the life of jimmy <UNK> which starred douglas fairbanks jr as the <UNK> on the <UNK> br br even with the <UNK> now upon production by the <UNK> office this remake actually turns out to be better than the original douglas fairbanks jr is horribly miscast as a <UNK> john garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play br br they made me a criminal was directed by busby berkeley who jack warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals berkeley in fact would soon be leaving warner brothers for mgm br br berkeley does do a fine job here keeping the action flowing at a good pace i particularly like the scene where four of the dead end kids and garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down they get it out of it quite <UNK> and with some good <UNK> br br other performances besides garfield and the kids to remember are may <UNK> who runs the summer camp for the kids and claude <UNK> as the obsessed detective on <UNK> trail
<START> i caught this movie late night on tv and was expecting a low budget campy masterpiece i was surprised with a pretty decent movie angelina <UNK> unique acting <UNK> or should i say lack thereof make her perfect as an <UNK> and the other actors while terribly average are at least not terrible br br there is a plot a fairly intricate plot at that involving <UNK> and the <UNK> a couple one human one <UNK> will go to pursue their illegal romance with a big brother type figure and <UNK> assassin thrown in the mix the production and sets also were much better than i expected i haven't seen the original cyborg so i can't really compare it to much else granted this film is no blade runner but as a late night futuristic guilty pleasure its worth a watch
<START> this is probably the worst film i have ever seen mike myers tries to be a dramatic actor and fails miserably the children who have the major roles are almost impossible to understand and are really unpleasant characters it was not even worth the price of the rental
<START> poor bela lugosi just another day at work a group of <UNK> attempting to <UNK> the american war effort from the inside it's pretty hard to figure out at first because while we know these guys are up to something their method of operation just isn't very clear i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing there are a series of murders <UNK> by our hero a police force that doesn't know what is going on what a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house there are comments like a true <UNK> would do this or that it's obvious while suspicion <UNK> most of the world wouldn't know a spy or a <UNK> if it jumped up and bit them i also was surprised to see <UNK> moore the lone ranger in a romantic role i never realized that he ever did anything other than sit on a horse there is of course the <UNK> of the criminals as they think that they are <UNK> from the killer's guest list anyway bela is sort of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it as a curiosity and a period piece it may be fun to watch for some people
<START> i've read the comments on las vegas and do agree with some of them it's not brain surgery tv but then again i was under the impression that tv was mainly for <UNK> especially with what is going on in today's world let's face it a show about vegas that isn't a reality based programme isn't going to one based on reality because to me vegas is pure fantasy it's the sort of place where we can go and pretty much do what we want when we want subject to <UNK> obviously br br therefore the fact that las vegas is pretty sexy and cliched with characters that reflect all this seems to be on the money in my eyes if you don't like it don't watch it that what we have a million channels for br br we're coming up to the third episode here in the uk and i know that i will be making a <UNK> to watch it again i just hope it's not cancelled something that seems to be happening a lot with most of the shows that come to the uk that are half decent <UNK> and jake 2 0 anyone br br it's harmless great looking fun and <UNK> i watch it i want to go back to the real thing
<START> hbo created this show for purposes of making us see the most realistic view of prison possible and they did a hell of a job oz was created by the creators of homicide who wanted to show a raw version of prison this show is what launched the idea of every other hbo original program such as the sopranos sex and the city the wire <UNK> <UNK> and six feet under amongst others oz is the <UNK> for the <UNK> state a fictional prison in some us state which is never stated though with the accents crime scenes and racial distribution ny is assumed the main prison unit looked at on the show is <UNK> city a seemingly ideal prison unit with more than others thought out by a liberal unit manager named tim <UNK> overall this show shows us what it is really like if one wishes to survive in prison br br there are about 10 gangs shown on oz first we have the muslims a group of blacks who wish to destroy the <UNK> of the criminal justice system and help improve living conditions for blacks everywhere they are led by <UNK> said a black <UNK> minister who wishes to destroy everything racist about the <UNK> system as a group they are not so much anti white but rather anti injustice our second group of blacks is the <UNK> who are essentially the street blacks who wish to keep all the bad ghetto <UNK> up and run the drug trade their <UNK> <UNK> mainly because they are always losing members due to violence in this group one character who is acted <UNK> is simon is an african <UNK> who is essentially the most <UNK> evil character alive this gang as a whole gets side help from the irish at times and is always in conflict with the <UNK> and for drug distribution purposes being that oz is mostly black the <UNK> have the most soldiers of any gang inside br br the <UNK> and like the <UNK> have varying <UNK> due to violent deaths that occur throughout the show the pretty much have the most substantial say in how any illegal activity gets <UNK> in oz the <UNK> make their presence known so that they can at least be <UNK> well if they are not in control unlike the <UNK> however these gangs do not have as much internal battle for power and are usually more stable when it comes to drug usage the irish who are mentioned above are a smaller gang led by a manipulative and ryan <UNK> <UNK> always manages to stay in good <UNK> with all the drug powers and manages to manipulate things in his way whenever he wants they are in no illegal control but they are at least on good terms with all those who are br br amongst the <UNK> inmates we have the <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> are merely a bunch of <UNK> drug users who help the <UNK> out most of the time the <UNK> are the most hated and hateful gang to most any viewer of oz they are led by <UNK> who is amongst the most racist <UNK> and sadistic characters one will ever see both gangs control nothing illegal they just merely let the darker skinned inmates see that they are a substantial threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft we also have the others the others is a gang of <UNK> prisoners who are not necessarily a problem to any other <UNK> in this group we see <UNK> a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life is forever altered by prison we also see <UNK> hill a black man bound to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who <UNK> the show and introduces the audience to every <UNK> the character's crimes are shown as they are introduced and <UNK> lets us know how long they will be in prison finally amongst gangs there are the christians and gays the christians merely stay religious to keep from going mental and the gays are a bunch of cross <UNK> who are often raped by other inmates br br this show gets in depth on a lot of issues dealing with the criminal justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison since language is <UNK> we here more racial <UNK> and <UNK> words than we would on any other tv show <UNK> <UNK> commentary provides a good way for us to truly understand each and every issue involved with oz this show as good as it is is not at all for the light to medium hearted it <UNK> shows drug use and distribution by any means possible prison rape murders fatal <UNK> and general gore than anything anyone else has seen in my opinion it is the most influential and greatest show ever created but i can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show if you are at all interested by shows and movies about prison oz is a must see
<START> what a ridiculous waste of time and money this movie was the biggest loser of the year all the hype was a warning i am disappointed for julia roberts by far she is the most talented cast member i think her ability to truly act carried the film the buddy buddy boys club was a little too phony and to add insult to injury why bother to cast catherine zeta jones she only has the ability to ruin a film she lacks the ability to have on screen chemistry with anyone not to mention she lacks the ability to act she lacks chemistry with the other characters kind of reminiscent of america's she made the <UNK> <UNK> this movie is headed nowhere what a shame please please don't tell me 13 is on the way
<START> why did i have to go out and buy yes buy jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman maybe it was a burst of temporary mental <UNK> but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost it was a silly but funny horror comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george that and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy <UNK> by this giant <UNK> coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all so i thought if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter gore in it it should be fun right well i was so dead wrong br br let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot i mean a mutant killer snowman on a <UNK> island that <UNK> mutant killer baby <UNK> which can only be killed or <UNK> by <UNK> as much as i love the premise i really hated the movie first of all while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie seemingly being shot on real film and all this sequel has the look and feel of a third rate soap opera it has this way too slick shot on video look the lighting is just plain awful bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night the acting well don't even go there the dialogues range from stiff to extremely <UNK> that <UNK> man was just moronic saying man after every sentence and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all i could think of was a seventh rate <UNK> from child's play <UNK> dumb and supposedly witty one liners before he kills someone br br the best joke was were one guy asks why are you talking to your watch and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked thank god for that oh yeah and that little scene over the end credits with those two japanese <UNK> on a <UNK> ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too but the worst thing about this movie was where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings a lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all off screen like i've read in many other comments there were indeed nice set ups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being <UNK> out tongue ripped out but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood <UNK> on the floor or nothing at all that frontal shot of that british guy being <UNK> from the back cover of the dvd wasn't even in the movie i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back meaning i didn't see sh t i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then i get to see nothing what a let down could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie that would be a shame 'cause only a decent amount of splatter fun could have saved this movie if you ask me seeing a lot of killer <UNK> reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me speaking of those <UNK> they were done very poorly they made <UNK> look like state of the art <UNK> but i guess that was the whole point of it at some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi boy you really have to see it to believe it best is to not see it actually 'cause this flick is just too bad okay i did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse just stick with the first jack frost 1996 and you'll be okay just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror comedy but fun in it's own right br br it's funny but writer director michael <UNK> somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2 and then focused on writing turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside starring ryan <UNK> and identity starring john cusack so the man seems to have some talent after all br br now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny <UNK> and one point for those completely retarded <UNK> babies way to go mr <UNK>
<START> this must have been one of <UNK> most ambitious projects he throws in virtually everything from visual gags and <UNK> comedy sketches to social relevance romance even some violence the mixture is challenging and intriguing and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences like the one where chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a <UNK> that will order their self sacrifice but the ingredients don't always click together and the mix and tone seem kind of <UNK> as for the famous final speech though undeniably honest it also seems a bit naive today with its <UNK> to a better world where man will overcome his hate and brutality and his soul will fly great by jack <UNK> and the beautiful <UNK>
<START> bad news for anyone wanting to film a full length parody of a lifetime network movie the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it albeit unintentionally all of the lifetime <UNK> are there a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker an <UNK> ex husband who of course cheated on her while they were married and a police department that <UNK> her complaints forcing her to stand up for herself especially jaw dropping is the scene where the heroine after enduring a break in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly <UNK> stalker decides to <UNK> the stress by going shopping having seen first hand the <UNK> of a co worker by some creep she met at church i know stalking is not a joke but it certainly is in this movie
<START> i rented the movie and liked it so much that i bought it <UNK> wood <UNK> and joseph bobby are outstanding as the two boys their new <UNK> physically <UNK> bobby the abuse is implied for the most part not seen and a lot of passion in me to help abused children there is a magical quality to the movie as the <UNK> imagination helps them find a way to deal with the abuse you have to try to understand the story from a child's point of view i'm still thinking about the ending i've watched the movie 3 or 4 times and each time i think of possible new meanings i'm not sure exactly what richard <UNK> intended me to think but this is an excellent film joseph and <UNK> wood will make you go hug your kids
<START> i saw wicked little things as part of the 8 films to die for <UNK> and this was the only film that disappointed me to wit a mom her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the <UNK> mountains every night however the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they find br br i guess the director was <UNK> on his viewers being <UNK> that children would be capable of murders and eating human flesh of which there are lavish close ups as a nice homage to george romero because the film just isn't scary otherwise simply put there are far too many establishing shots of the evil kids <UNK> to their next murder site if someone's gonna get it in the <UNK> there will be a shot of the kids arriving at the <UNK> oh the suspense and then moving in for the kill br br come to think of it why do the kids suddenly walk so slowly when they corner their prey and not that i have any experience in this but i think a shotgun blast will throw a child a lot <UNK> than this film implies nor does it help that the mom is one of the worst parents i've ever seen in any film the lock on the front door is <UNK> you have an eight year old daughter in the woods with bears and mountain lions fix it you moron plus mom and her oldest daughter look <UNK> too close together in age even for a teen <UNK> and there's a pretty unbelievable death which involves <UNK> up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt br br i'm giving this a 3 because it tried as a splatter film it's not bad but for good scares go elsewhere
<START> synopsis <UNK> high school senior <UNK> b <UNK> justin long finds himself without a college to attend he has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college board of eight <UNK> his mom and dad are very disappointed that <UNK> hasn't been accepted into college his parents think that if <UNK> doesn't go to college he will have no future several of friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the <UNK> they applied to to satisfy their parents <UNK> comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site they <UNK> an abandoned psychiatric facility into the south <UNK> <UNK> of technology they will be the only students however the web site states that we accept anyone on the first day of school they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all <UNK> with a million dollars in <UNK> money <UNK> must make his fake college into a <UNK> one he hires uncle ben lewis black as the college dean the fun begins when they design their own <UNK> make their own rules and party all night br br my comment the premise of starting a college without a teaching staff is a little off the wall since it was a fake college <UNK> really didn't need a staff the movie reminded me of the classic movie animal house the college setting the <UNK> lots of gags and pretty young women these new college <UNK> had a different notion of what the college experience was all about the movie not only has lots of humor it also has a good message for life people should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do the ending was a little unrealistic but it is only a movie the movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun universal pictures run time 1 <UNK> rated pg 13 7 10
<START> one good thing this hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end an example of low budget film making at it's best writer director skip woods uses seemingly everything he could find ex <UNK> super model cow phone and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all of his camera set ups br br another good thing this movie seems to be made for the dvd era with several segments that <UNK> a larger story similar to the work of tarantino and robert <UNK> each chapter of the film features thomas jane's main character spending one day at home <UNK> quick and memorable performances by aaron <UNK> plummer mickey rourke michael <UNK> james <UNK> and an unforgettable role by br br even another good thing not exactly a good thing but incredibly shocking and memorable every person who sees this movie remembers one important scene much as deliverance will always be remembered for it's awful rape of ned beatty <UNK> will go down as the movie where a woman <UNK> rapes an unwilling man unforgettable br br one bad thing the title makes people think it is somehow related to or derivative of the friday series of films featuring ice cube br br grade a
<START> this film shows up on the <UNK> cable channels quite often and i find that i keep watching it over and over again the performances are wonderful and the material has so much happening that there is always something new to take away from the film br br maybe i am too often distracted when watching films at home you know the <UNK> the dogs <UNK> the phone rings the popcorn finishes during the credits but this film is about people and what <UNK> us what <UNK> us what causes <UNK> between us and what <UNK> us br br for me it is films like the love letter that keep me taking a chance on new films frankly i am surprised that the film is not better known i would love to see <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in many more roles they are a delight to watch kate <UNK> is wonderful and i had no previous idea that she would be ellen <UNK> plays a role that is much more complex than simply being the comic relief br br this film provides interesting visuals as a proper background to the characters and their interactions i find it refreshing every time i take the time to watch it
<START> a couple move into their dream home unaware that it and its <UNK> have been built over land <UNK> used as a cemetery the film is said to have been based on a true story although how much of it is supposed to be true is not <UNK> the plot is hardly unique see spielberg's <UNK> 1982 within a short time they experience various supernatural <UNK> these range from the disturbing mysterious shadows the serious illness of the daughter to the frankly ridiculous <UNK> continually <UNK> and garage doors going out of control there is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery we do not learn anything more the plot does not seem to develop the characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable nor is the atmosphere particularly special the film could be disturbing to some viewers there is no sense of <UNK> or any kind of positive message from it
<START> so americans make t v series based on movies whilst us brits make films based on t v shows it should never work but on this occasion it does because of a sublime meeting of character and actor cliches are sometimes <UNK> so and leonard was born to play this is one of the great comic creations kind of how norman bates would have turned out if he'd been <UNK> instead if murderous
<START> worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the <UNK> after she is linked to the death of her husband and sister determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state her peril increasing at each stop chasing after her are the traditional <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> pair of partners one is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home this pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her all the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some br br wow this was a bad movie the lead acted as if she was the cops couldn't find a suspect if he or she is in the police station this happens twice and everyone else is as one dimensional as can be avoid this one at all costs br br
<START> i remember watching this as a child as part of the children s film <UNK> friday film <UNK> on <UNK> and have recently happened upon a copy br br in the twenty or so years since my last viewing this film has lost nothing br br it is an atmospheric tale which <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and adds elements of truly creepy imagery of the ghost of the young <UNK> billy br br shot in the wonderfully <UNK> <UNK> area of <UNK> the film <UNK> the mixture of rugged <UNK> and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believable br br there is much packed into this drama something long since lost from children's television today and well worth a look if you can track down a copy
<START> is it a poorly acted cliche ridden pile of trash of course anyone who doesn't realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesn't have any right judging movies in the first place thus i will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10 br br violence and gore 4 for this genre there are very few deaths and the gore is almost non existent anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere the only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things which raises the bar a little br br suspense 1 okay i feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of <UNK> looking kids br br nudity sex 7 lots of <UNK> from three different women one of whom is the mtv <UNK> julie brown there are two sex scenes but little is shown in them br br unintentional humor 4 there are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary but all in all it's just bad not funny bad br br overall 4 it's not unwatchable there are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie however only watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's slasher flicks this definitely falls on the lower end of the scale but it's not all the way at the bottom the real downside is the disappointing ending it almost ruined the movie for me
<START> i was so looking forward to watching the documentary self of the mastermind behind <UNK> saints one of the most <UNK> and pointless movies i've ever seen but the makers of overnight buddies ex of the mastermind in question also need to learn how to make a movie various <UNK> remarks yelling <UNK> into the phone and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make mr <UNK> look like a <UNK> but it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place what his creative process or vision is what's <UNK> saints even about how hard is it to meet patrick <UNK> what are these strange <UNK> <UNK> in which our disgusting heroes are caught because the film doesn't try to answer these questions in any coherent way it doesn't end up having doo to say about hollywood either so who cares
<START> this latter day fulci is a totally abysmal <UNK> dealing with an <UNK> <UNK> brett <UNK> who decides <UNK> style to pay off his ever rising <UNK> by <UNK> some of the <UNK> <UNK> you will ever lay your eyes on and who just happen to be wealthy <UNK> the fulci penned script also <UNK> to <UNK> a few <UNK> comedic elements which only result in some unfunny business involving a corpse which won't stay put an opera singer victim who won't stop singing etc not to mention a <UNK> theme straight out of the student of <UNK> although in this case the two <UNK> communicate via pre recorded radio messages in the end i can't say i'm surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of mario <UNK> <UNK> for the honeymoon 1970 which it resembles in several ways and that it is content to merely pile up the <UNK> gory but none too convincing effects of <UNK> limbs and <UNK> or melting faces with which alas fulci had by then become completely associated
<START> san francisco oh you <UNK> town thank you god for destroying it and making <UNK> fall on our collective heads and for <UNK> into oblivion <UNK> of thousands of your innocent <UNK> sheep oh lord who art so <UNK> in <UNK> heavenly ways these should have been the lyrics to the title song of this oh so inspiring and utterly mindless film br br the movie starts well enough with gable discovering a cinderella with a highly annoying but much appreciated operatic voice and she soon shoots to stardom one of the many problems with our cinderella is that she is played by <UNK> macdonald who if one takes the time to look through all that make up and 30s <UNK> <UNK> realizes that she is kind of ugly too ugly to be playing this role anyway yet gable and everyone else <UNK> all over here as if she were some damn beauty or something another problem with cinderella is that her character is so utterly humble wholesome innocent god loving kind and generous enough to make you vomit for a full hour macdonald plays her admittedly one dimensional role with the sort of <UNK> oh and <UNK> that serves to annoy rather than make her sympathetic br br tracy has been better and had better roles than playing this clichéd heart of gold god loving non child <UNK> priest who boxes in his free time as if priests have anything to do how cute even the ever reliable gable is not up to his usual standard he is far too animated and his character is far too <UNK> for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious western <UNK> though this obviously is the <UNK> fault br br the plot is basically this gable and his rival holt play <UNK> <UNK> with cinderella using her as the ball how well first she is working singing for gable then she works for the square holt then she goes back to gable only to return very soon to holt and of course both want to have her as girlfriend wife and if the <UNK> hadn't interrupted this table <UNK> plot it's a safe bet that she would have been <UNK> back and forth another ten times the <UNK> <UNK> little princess that she is br br there are many far too many in fact musical numbers it's almost as though they tried to make the first disaster movie musical ever how silly the stuff she sings in <UNK> joint is okay but when she starts <UNK> out those high pitched annoying <UNK> during the opera segments that is when i felt that my ears were and <UNK> attacked by enemy sound fire in fact there is an opera number that lasts 6 damn minutes 6 may seem like little for those who haven't had first hand experience with such horrors of audio torture but it's like with dog years a <UNK> year is equivalent to seven human ones a minute of opera is equivalent to 100 minutes of chinese torture or a dog <UNK> acid on your leg br br i thought this was a disaster movie but it's more like a near disaster movie i read that some of the dialog in this film was written by a silent era film director jesus the melodramatic and only occasionally amusing proceedings get interrupted by the real star of this movie namely the <UNK> only after well over one and a half hours when joe the <UNK> finally does shake up the city and our clichéd characters in it i almost felt like saying thank god death and destruction are finally here unfortunately joe comes too late into the movie to save it from its increasing mediocrity the scenes of <UNK> are very good but even the <UNK> part of the movie gets ruined pun by a highly annoying religious ending you see gable who <UNK> to be an <UNK> all along without actually using the word itself finally finds macdonald alive after having searched for days and suddenly he is converted into a believer because cinderella is alive how stupid all that tells me is that <UNK> character is a weak minded moron br br the movie ends on a very dumb note indeed gable having said thank you to god for saving his girl and he does his on his knees finds god sees the light and the movie's little old devil gable <UNK> himself into a believer how very god american an ending br br of course no one thought of asking this god why the hell there was an <UNK> in the first place the sad and unintentional irony is that gable in the end becomes a sucker all along he had made fun of <UNK> who fall for the <UNK> of them all namely religion and in the end he himself becomes one now that's what i call a triumph of the human spirit another irony is that the ending was supposed to have improved gable as a person but i see it quite differently on the contrary it took only one big joe to turn gable into a god <UNK> meek little <UNK> believer who joins the world's sheep family and as if this intellectual downfall of <UNK> wasn't pathetic and disappointing enough this first ever <UNK> musical ends with a truly hair raising take this word as you will noble and hope beautiful mass choir scene dozens or hundreds of <UNK> survivors and proud proud citizens of <UNK> <UNK> or did god perhaps <UNK> it sing all together the title song in hope for a better <UNK> joe less future <UNK> if you are a sucker for hollywood sentimentality do not skip this movie
<START> there are no saving <UNK> in this dreadful <UNK> boring <UNK> fest which brings to mind the <UNK> of red chief br br even though there are some big stars in this film the acting is almost uniformly terrible br br glenn ford normally a laid back kind of guy <UNK> it up with forced emotion br br donna reed is so over the top as to prove laughable br br leslie <UNK> is woefully miscast and is terrible br br the son is such a repulsive little brat i found myself rooting for the <UNK> br br the only decent performance in this <UNK> mash is the relatively minor role of the butler br br perhaps i'm being too harsh on the actors after all all they did were to read the lines given them in the script ah the script that turgid piece of contrived dreck that would like to <UNK> on your heart strings but merely turns your stomach
<START> there is a point in the film where the female boss of the death machines a multi ethnic trio to please everyone being <UNK> i think it's called these days talks about using <UNK> on a business man except such is her delivery that it sounds like at which point this viewer <UNK> up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of <UNK> but it didn't the boss lady had to do the talking as the death machines did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does <UNK> there is action in the film but it is not that exciting and the plot <UNK> from one cliché to another the three mute death machines live to survive another day at the end of the film hopefully there wasn't a sequel
<START> pretty terrible but not entirely unwatchable another review mentioned predictable and that's almost an understatement you can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be every character is either stereotype or <UNK> the good guy in a bad situation the struggle between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline the repressed sexually emotionally <UNK> woman returning to the small town after failing in the big city engaged to the feeble minded beau from youth the <UNK> bad guys two lost boys looking for a sense of family they're all here and none of them with even the <UNK> spin of something new from the first few minutes you can figure out exactly what will happen by film's end the story isn't entirely lame but direction acting even from a cast with some talent everything is thrown together without skill as to the storyline we've all seen it before in a movie called sister act this is also one of those films where <UNK> to small details show up in an even more glaring light as example the nurse and our hero drive into town but park several <UNK> away from their <UNK> post office and <UNK> store yet both walk across empty parking lots for no apparent reason or the passage of morning to night during a scene that seemingly should occur in no more than half an hour the movie is filled with that kind of stuff and then <UNK> on an improbable denouement
<START> this is one of those movies where i just want to move my feet and dance around the house it's a very positive and happy type of music the movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy gary busey did a great job as buddy holly buddy holly kept on going even tho his <UNK> his parents and the <UNK> record producer told him no buddy holly didn't give up on what he liked i didn't know much about buddy holly until i watched this movie i've been to the surf ballroom where he last played but didn't give much attention to it until i watched this movie it's an incredible movie with lots of fun so get on your feet and see this movie
<START> after reading the novel which is about a one hour read watching this film became a sad disappointing experience just as he did in prince of egypt simon wells somehow managed to direct a script that took away all the drama and mystery out of its source material and turned it into this <UNK> nonsense now i'm a sucker for cheese and camp but this movie made absolutely no sense there was no joy in any of the performances or any humor there were no thrills and that silly <UNK> with character of throwing his hat in the air was the last straw i felt very <UNK> when this movie was over and i still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes it went on forever i wondered how the studio and director could have <UNK> such a lousy script but then my friend pitched the movie to me exactly as it was and i said wow that sounds great but what happened to the movie
<START> i must say it was a let down overall its great to see the way <UNK> has handled the issue of <UNK> i am not much <UNK> on this and got whatever it was depicted in a beautiful mind and here too its interesting portrayal br br but the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of english its true that a new class is being formed has been formed in india which talks in english even at home but i am sure its not as <UNK> as in the movie moreover <UNK> did not seem very comfortable talking everything in english dialogue in <UNK> tone was seemingly much more realistic and <UNK> br br the second thing its about the abstract flavor she has tried to give to the movie i generally like movies with open ending but here there were many loose ends its like cut pieces are joined together to make the movie also there seemed no central theme to the movie for sure was the main line but <UNK> sister sister mother daughter adding doctor <UNK> relation no real use of brother wife relations all were not required and made the audience loose track of what actually did she try to depict br br on the whole a watch for people who like off beat movies a must avoid for the ones who just see movies as an entertainment tool
<START> as i've <UNK> from film to film at the <UNK> film festival this film from the opening night has stayed with me curious because it is a dark comedy with quite an <UNK> premise br br a family of hyper <UNK> <UNK> in a small community of like minds is changed by an auto accident three of the four have the same near death experience in which they are fully opened as each receives a <UNK> of the concept of original sin i won't spoil this scene with the <UNK> the fourth a middle school <UNK> is not just the only one physically hurt but also is <UNK> and is now witness to what has become her crazy apparently <UNK> <UNK> family every new moment brings a new <UNK> as they have become <UNK> naked and frank in every way horrifying her and then the community br br <UNK> the has the most beautiful sexual <UNK> scene between a husband and wife that i have ever seen to the sarah song deliver me a song that can now bring tears to my eyes br br the cast is terrific robertson dean as the dad vince as the son and as the <UNK> daughter are excellent <UNK> <UNK> plays peggy the mom's questioning neighbor and best friend perfectly a much more nuanced fleshed out real character than what might have been everyone in middle america knows a peggy and <UNK> willis positively <UNK> as betty the mom there are lots of risks taken by the actors playing the three changed characters and these risks pay off br br i hope this film gets a wide release if so i plan to see it again br br very accurate review at http www com phil <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i can't remember the worst film i have watched total waste of actors and audience time if you prefer sitting by your tv and think when will be this film over then this is the right film for you maybe this film is recorded to make people believe that <UNK> has some <UNK> past but i must say i have not expect anything else from <UNK> <UNK> but i have expected more from vincent <UNK> the film lacks a plot character development denouement entire movie is about underground <UNK> and how they are <UNK> i must be fair there is some camera effect but even that is too poor over and over are the same pictures total waste of time
<START> there's a certain irony in a parody of the gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story's purpose was or just didn't care all of the <UNK> of your average family film are present <UNK> younger siblings a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the <UNK> and of course a romantic subplot the movie has very little in common with <UNK> original story which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic gothic <UNK> that were all the rage at the time if <UNK> saw this version he'd probably laugh and then of course write a parody one can only hope that the children who watched this bland mass produced <UNK> eventually discovered the wit and <UNK> of the original version
<START> the whole world is falling prey to a lethal disease and rain never stops <UNK> down nevertheless in this atmosphere of nightmare a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors thanks to a hole in the floor of the man's apartment they fall in love at least all would not have been lost although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and the weakness of human being there is also some room for hope in the shiny singing scenes
<START> awful in a bad good way this movie has officially become the worst made for tv movie in my book except for the camp value it offers i give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value suggestion watch with friends <UNK> and plenty of popcorn you'll want to throw some at the screen preferably friends who like chris <UNK> from his <UNK> in the city <UNK> this movie is dreadfully funny this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast members honestly i don't know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered daniel j is absolutely pathetic everyone <UNK> in the school of over acting and poor joan van <UNK> i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriously she is credited as a producer though her mom <UNK> and bad plastic surgery are scene this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social <UNK> when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as with <UNK> intent has anyone else had the pleasure
<START> <UNK> <UNK> 1990 marked a small but important <UNK> in my appreciation of horror flicks this was the date that <UNK> broadcast for the only time i'm aware of jeff super creepy 1981 shocker just before dawn and it made a huge impression on me nearly twenty years later i'm delighted to report that i've finally got my hands on the two disc <UNK> show media <UNK> special edition and it's just as eerie and unsettling as i remember it if not more so br br the plot as is usual for genre flicks and this was first film as a for though he did at least remove all the religious cult snake handling <UNK> <UNK> from the screenplay is a bit thin five likable twenty somethings including chris lemmon son of jack in a pair of <UNK> tight white <UNK> venture into the dense <UNK> <UNK> to do a spot of camping and to check out a <UNK> of land that's been <UNK> to one of their number but just before dawn stands out from a crowd of <UNK> because wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular <UNK> of mountain with a complete innocent <UNK> and a drunk <UNK> truck shoved down a hill and <UNK> in flames within minutes of the film beginning the youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> on the soundtrack and before you can say texas chainsaw massacre they've <UNK> an innocent deer with the front <UNK> and had their first taste of from the heavy set maniac responsible for the opening <UNK> forest ranger roy george kennedy warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further but they go ahead with the trip anyway <UNK> to give the <UNK> preacher a ride even though he's understandably scared witless and finally <UNK> camp miles from anywhere needless to say things go downhill from here br br although this film's not short on bloody horror and well handled action scenes the standout moments for me are those where lets his camera zoom out long and slow from apparently <UNK> shots of the fun loving kids <UNK> around in the wilderness or just lets it settle for a while on the dense <UNK> people <UNK> <UNK> he makes the <UNK> <UNK> as threatening and as ominous as kubrick made the overlook <UNK> <UNK> interiors in the shining and brad score <UNK> the horribly distorted <UNK> that runs over the titles stays the right side of <UNK> <UNK> the slowly <UNK> menace with subtlety and flair there are plenty of surprises along the way <UNK> to deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky disturbing family and a truly bizarre kill technique <UNK> shortly before the film's end i won't spoil it for you i've said enough br br quite why this <UNK> horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a <UNK> hit is hard to <UNK> but hopefully it will be <UNK> and appreciated for years to come it deserves to be
<START> boogie nights is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director this film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people this movie has an unexpected emotional impact also you will remember it long after it is over
<START> all right i'll grant you that some of the science in <UNK> or journey to the far side of the sun is kind of dopey the idea of an entire planet existing <UNK> because we can't see it on the other side of our sun doesn't hold up at all any <UNK> 101 student knows that another planet the size of earth would cause <UNK> in the motions of other planets that's how <UNK> <UNK> the existence of <UNK> after all and that's how they find and <UNK> and <UNK> on a regular basis br br and the idea that a mirror image earth somehow evolved in almost perfect parallel to our earth down to english speaking scientists and human counterparts for each human born on our earth that takes things out of <UNK> fiction and into twilight zone territory that's not necessarily a bad thing but it requires a major suspension of critical thinking to accept and enjoy br br but man this movie knocked my <UNK> off as an adolescent i was still used to fairly cheerful upbeat science fiction films when the hero won through in the end even 2001 could be interpreted as having an ending br br but in this case <UNK> attempted to <UNK> with his <UNK> so he could return to his own earth only to be <UNK> back out of his <UNK> <UNK> something about 'the not being <UNK> because his wasn't doing the same thing apparently <UNK> had decided he was happy in his new home <UNK> ship started the descent back to the launch site and i was certain that he would somehow get the damaged craft to land safely and try again armed with the new info that would let him and his <UNK> succeed he was the hero after all and the hero always wins through in the end br br instead <UNK> couldn't maintain control of the crippled craft and the <UNK> subsequent crash into the launch site was so horrible and devastating that it killed everyone except for the chief project leader and destroyed all records of the project and <UNK> existence <UNK> never got to go home and he <UNK> <UNK> his secrets never revealed br br except for the planet of the apes series i had never seen such a sad and downbeat ending and it always stuck in my mind especially the <UNK> <UNK> of the crash scene near the beginning of the move you knew that spaceship was never going to fly again and the one at the very end br br i'd love to see this movie again and see how well it held up over the years
<START> first off this movie is not near complete my guess is that someone actually bothered to steal every other page of the script br br the movie contains bizarre time travels without notice inconsistent dialogs misplaced details all over the music isn't very bad at all other then misplaced tracks and besides the fact that the volume goes up and down between the different tracks the cutting room did a descent job actually and that says a lot sound effects ruin the tension though br br luke perry does what he does best just looking worried and occasionally <UNK> up <UNK> from hell br br i seriously rate this movie as the worst of 2007 and i've seen a few bad ones do not spend money on this one it's not so bad it's a laugh it's worse ratings above 1 star should render a <UNK> at imdb because it's a damn lie
<START> unlike what one reviewer said this is not a ripoff of <UNK> force in that one lieutenant hal <UNK> put together his own little squad from academy <UNK> to <UNK> repeat <UNK> in extreme justice this operation has the <UNK> from the higher ups of the <UNK> just how far they <UNK> the exact methods used is open to question br br this special <UNK> squad seems to be quite the <UNK> for the <UNK> of the <UNK> those that have forgotten their first duty is protection and service which is why scott glenn thinks lou diamond phillips a detective with more than his share of <UNK> with internal affairs for excessive use of force is perfect for the squad br br what should have sent him running from phillips is the fact he's got a nice live in relationship with a reporter <UNK> field that one certainly threw me in this film you'd think that lou would be the last guy he'd try to <UNK> for his team br br and what his team is is a death squad they target <UNK> follow them and wait to catch them in the act then it's open season br br extreme justice went very overboard in trying to make a point there sure would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and taking them down outside no civilians got hurt when the citizens of did that to the or waiting until three <UNK> finish the job before moving in that's what were asked to believe here br br and frankly i couldn't buy it a lot of good players get really wasted in this one
<START> unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie i'm really not the much of a <UNK> <UNK> fan to say the least however when i saw that the movie had fred <UNK> and robert <UNK> both great actors i just had to watch the film <UNK> is a <UNK> smith an alcoholic cop who is to <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> and even worse having to team up with <UNK> at the <UNK> of the captain robert <UNK> <UNK> is always watchable it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichéd it also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to be committed to celluloid <UNK> would return to the <UNK> character in a few more films the next one being down n dirty br br eye candy nina richardson shows some t a mary goes topless br br my grade d br br where i saw it showtime extreme
<START> bad bad bad those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema and its 1 movie in america what is this country thinking mike myers looking more like micheal jackson some <UNK> lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes a lame plot with dirty jokes it's <UNK> and awful when green eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i'll be so happy not eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two <UNK> trying to find the lost green eggs and ham they'll try to chase sam i am and that mean guy who are running away with it i hope they don't ruin the classic book don't waste time and money by seeing this
<START> <UNK> hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is everyone out there will like it <UNK> between the amount of breast shots the times <UNK> <UNK> herself the various times jackie spends <UNK> to herself and the times spent <UNK> in the mountains this could create one hell of a <UNK> if your career were to end br br unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless <UNK> with <UNK> green <UNK> this one takes awhile to the performing is good other than great acting by dan the pizza delivery guy must see there are no <UNK> but no notably bad <UNK> from my recent dinner either and i do mean recent excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which you'd find in movies of the four skin related data fields or in the <UNK> found in any <UNK> shop in addition if you see a female in this movie the <UNK> is that she will be butt naked by the next scene now that i think about it there is quite a bit of action in this movie between the first and the second <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from a hot chick and the time you observe her <UNK> naked keeps <UNK> <UNK> i loved it
<START> i don't know if i'm wrong or everybody that says this movie is good are sincerely i just wanna do a favor to people that has doubts about seeing it renting it or even worse buying it don't do it really br br the trailers and very early previews might seem fun in some way or another but its not funny at all it gets to fall in a series of you're supposed to laugh here scenes that tend to get in really bad jokes bad very very bad acting tasteless scenes cheesy effects this movie has it all all wrong that is br br as final comment the movie would have been funny due to the basic concept but believe me is really way far from that
<START> i think this is one of the best <UNK> movies i've seen in a while i love the fact that it doesn't <UNK> around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly the cast did a great job and i especially <UNK> the girl she was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother best of all are the songs beautiful music and moving lyrics there are some great songs in this move <UNK> especially and great songs both of them i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting and superb songs cheers
<START> christmas in <UNK> is an absolute gem and a must see for christmas elizabeth lane a <UNK> to martha stewart is a magazine <UNK> and the <UNK> plus ultra of the perfect wife mother and domestic <UNK> only thing is she is none of these things a total phony unfortunately for her she is about to be found out her <UNK> mr alexander <UNK> a brilliant comic turn by sydney <UNK> gets the bright idea of <UNK> a famous war hero to <UNK> perfect farm for the christmas holiday only thing there is no farm perfect or otherwise the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real identity under <UNK> so she will not lose her job <UNK> colleague john happens to have a farm in <UNK> so that <UNK> that problem however he wants to marry liz but she does not want to marry him he offers her marriage though he knows she doesn't feel the same way about him that he does about her he makes the offer anyway and <UNK> her that he is willing to wait and here barbara stanwyck as liz delivers one of the most devastating put downs i have ever heard with perfect innocence she replies could you wait that long <UNK> in addition the scenes between <UNK> <UNK> and s z are hilarious they don't seem to like one another though one suspects they really do they are rivals in the household and s z <UNK> english is <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of his name mr my name is felix it is amazing how christmas y these black and white films are great character work by all involved don't miss this one
<START> this is definitely a touching movie and a great expression of charles personal struggle the movie is not only about his struggle to get his book the origin of species published but also his relationship with his oldest daughter his daughter was at start the only person in his family to <UNK> of his views something that she as well had to pay for <UNK> more than him at times br br now this is not an <UNK> propaganda film as a matter of fact i think it managed to stay very neutral a hard thing to do in my opinion of course it does not <UNK> the way the characters was treated by the church quite the opposite actually if you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film it will be liked by and <UNK> alike but goes away from the movie talks about evolution and that's it br br paul <UNK> as charles <UNK> was incredible of course we all may think of <UNK> as that old man with the funny beard but this movie centers around the man in his late <UNK> early 30's jennifer <UNK> emma <UNK> is great as always but the actor who impressed me was martha west as annie <UNK> daughter definitely on of the best child actors of the decade the story is about <UNK> and his daughter and it is beautifully acted br br except for a few jumps in time that was <UNK> confusing the production of this film is pretty flawless some scenes were <UNK> <UNK> nature is just marvelous and is almost like taken out of a high production national <UNK> documentary br br i must admit though i'm not quite sure of why they chose creation as the title i doubt it is an irony the movie is too <UNK> for that well i'm sure there's a meaning too it just don't let it scare you away br br i give this movie a 9 10 this is truly a great tribute to charles <UNK> and please give it a chance
<START> i've watched a lot of tv through the years so much that when i start seeing new shows that basically seem like reruns of old shows i get insulted luckily i am not too sensitive because all hot <UNK> does is <UNK> the cast meaning make them <UNK> of <UNK> women and drops them in new york city instead of georgia br br the jokes are more tv 14 ish but it does not make the show any better the only thing that this show has proved is that nicole sullivan is so good that she could have made a show like my mother the car a classic her comic talents remind one of a modern day lucille ball only funnier unfortunately the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy which might be good for some brainless soap but they just aren't funny br br fred
<START> i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie the acting is astonishing the movie itself is powerful and clear and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth br br this is an important movie it could be profoundly <UNK> br br i would pay good money never ever to see it again because it is so good and so complex it is extremely difficult to watch i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important those of you with greater <UNK> than i have may find it easier to handle br br but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once preferably with others so you can talk to each other and have someone around to remind you that there's more to the world than the movie
<START> i thought this was a beautiful film it is not my favourite of his films <UNK> express holds that spot this one is quite different from anything else i have seen of his it is slow but not annoyingly so it takes its time and <UNK> the characters there is minimal movement in the frame the <UNK> is wonderful the acting is great the film feels like a long warm <UNK> drink
<START> thomas hardy is one of my favorite authors some truly wonderful movies have been made from his novels far from the <UNK> crowd tess of the the mayor of and i had high hopes for this one the hallmark hall of fame of return of the native totally <UNK> it the cast was terrific the photography excellent but the script was dismal and the direction positively <UNK> people walked up to people said lines walked away a <UNK> excitement developed when clive owen and catherine zeta jones very young very beautiful <UNK> a bit of flesh <UNK> but even clive who is a superb actor couldn't save it it was <UNK> with the usual hallmark romantic strings background music and pretend <UNK> offering plot exposition and what could have been dynamite turned out to be awful the <UNK> of the above three movies was absent
<START> while i agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix bronson paul once again takes to the streets given a license to kill by the chief police no less and moves into his friends apartment who you guessed it was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood which looks like it's funny that people who associate with bronson have a habit of getting killed bronson <UNK> kills them off one by one as the people in the neighborhood are used against him there are some dynamics between bronson and who leads the street gang you can tell they both enjoy their work at one point in the movie after they <UNK> in the city jail <UNK> i'm going to kill a little old lady just for you catch it on the 6 00 news the a purse thief who laughs as he's committing his crimes is also enjoyable to watch the movie was made in 1985 and most people probably could identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are cast in the movie it's enjoyable watching bronson paul rid the streets of these thugs watch for the appearance of the <UNK> a serious piece of <UNK> that bronson <UNK> i also really liked the soundtrack to this movie
<START> i have great memories of this movie br br i was only 12 when it was released and it scared the <UNK> out of me i really miss my <UNK> br br zombies <UNK> how can you go wrong it's like retarded cousin br br this movie was released 1 year before the pg 13 rating was <UNK> br br i submit that one dark night is the <UNK> pg movie not scariest mind you that has ever been released br br can anyone come up with a <UNK> pick br br <UNK> i don't consider <UNK> to be <UNK> scarier yes but not <UNK>
<START> gen y cops since i heard of the film being in release i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen x cops i was a little disappointed that a nicholas <UNK> didn't return and b too much slapstick nevertheless i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own way br br stephen <UNK> returns as the ladies man match who has a steady girl in note where is <UNK> and sam lee returns as the insane alien this time sporting a <UNK> and speaking a lot of english the real star of the film is newcomer edison <UNK> he makes a great replacement for nicholas <UNK> as edison i also enjoyed paul <UNK> performance of agent curtis he seems to be the tough as nails fbi agent you'd love to hate but soon you'd like his character br br the fight scenes are a lot better in this one even though there are very few but they are great courtesy of jackie chan <UNK> <UNK> li br br look for a cameo from ron as a cage fighter who has a <UNK> little fight with match also is the stunt double for rudd br br if you liked gen x cops you'll love gen y cops
<START> this is the greatest show ever made next to south park i love this show it is so funny and <UNK> laugh is hilarious you need to watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before one of my favorite shows of all time br br if you can try to see some of the later episodes such as i dream of jesus or tales of a third grade nothing but there's never been an episode i didn't like all of the episodes are absolutely hilarious it's got a great satire to it as well you can find a lot of clips on you tube if you're somewhere near a computer or a tv see it right away however you can
<START> midnight madness is a movie that is unfortunately highly underrated and <UNK> with a <UNK> of classic edgy teen college movies this one was forgotten as a child i would watch this movie over and over again luckily i had it on video this movie shows a more tame but most exciting side of the eighties in the cynical society we live in this day and age with drug abuse being the coolest thing it's good to see once in awhile a fun innocent movie that is midnight madness that is if you can find it
<START> as a former <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> player i feel like i can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been put forward i think that i am also in a position to offer some insight into the club and back stories oh and this is gonna be a long post i can tell already br br first off the people who said that the movie doesn't show real <UNK> have a valid point the movie is full of bad <UNK> people in the wrong places and much much more if you want to know what a real <UNK> game feels like you won't get the best idea from this movie but the thing is anything short of actually sitting down and watching a highlight reel or jumping into a game yourself is not going to be satisfactory it's hollywood not <UNK> really how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game not many that i have seen i think it's important to keep in mind that the movie is about <UNK> players much more than it is about <UNK> br br next the is very much a part of <UNK> <UNK> it is not something that they just threw into the movie to be honest i don't know how the tradition got started but <UNK> <UNK> the all blacks in many ways the uniform is based off of the all blacks as well the movie did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the and to be honest i don't think that that is right but i can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means as for the person from china who said that only a can perform a i would suggest that they take a look at the all blacks and tell me if they think that they are all believe it or not <UNK> has a very large <UNK> community and a good portion of them like and play <UNK> for the local teams i myself am part <UNK> whenever possible the is led by a the team does not do it because they think that they are they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie the concept of <UNK> and those who have gone before is a huge part of the <UNK> culture and the message behind the for any of those that are familiar with it support those values it's a <UNK> by a chief who thought he would die <UNK> mate and those around him supporting him telling him he will live <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> him up how appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do it is not for me to say but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done <UNK> is also a well used team <UNK> even if the actors had a hard time saying it br br also for the people who <UNK> <UNK> playing ability i would just remind you that you were not really watching <UNK> play in this movie many of the extras were former players from <UNK> and other teams but the main characters were all actors believe it or not <UNK> really is pretty good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community granted some years produce better teams than others it's what you would expect with any sports team but you don't <UNK> win record by just being okay the year after i <UNK> 1998 <UNK> was one of 12 teams to be invited to the world schools <UNK> championship in <UNK> the teams were hand picked from around the world and represented the best of high school <UNK> talent at the time <UNK> obviously didn't win first place new zealand did that but they did manage to take third place in the <UNK> beating the national <UNK> in their last match and while american <UNK> may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about <UNK> also has a tradition of <UNK> new zealand every few years and usually comes back with more wins than <UNK> br br the majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based off of real people and real stories i watched this movie with my brothers who also played for <UNK> and between the four of us we were fairly certain that we were able to identify almost every main character nobody knew a white <UNK> of course as this wasn't a documentary hollywood did take some liberties but to tell you the truth not as many as you might think the film was actually pretty accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practices as well as the mandatory personal running and weight training sometimes it really was running until you threw up it also showed the service and other team activities like the chuck a <UNK> <UNK> that were very much a part of team bonding br br and finally the movie in my obviously very biased opinion it was a pretty good movie and i think that the reason for it is that i watched it as an inspirational sports movie i didn't think that it would be a pure <UNK> movie or an academy award winning drama it was just an uplifting movie about a <UNK> team complete with morals <UNK> and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment i hope that i addressed some of the problems that people have had with the movie and hope that you can now enjoy it for what it was br br <UNK>
<START> i caught this at the chicago and have to say you are alone is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think not ha ha wedding <UNK> funny but sick twisted i can't believe she just said that but it's so damn true funny br br jessica who deservedly won best actress is amazing to watch there's never a moment when you think oh i'm watching a movie and she's an actress she's too damn real for words br br in fact there's 2 scenes that i'm still <UNK> over and i won't give them away but in one she's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how awesome it is i almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing br br in another she talks about a teenagers definition of sex versus an adults and if it isn't the <UNK> dialog i've heard in a movie in a long time i don't know what is
<START> i have never watched a movie that frustrated me more than lord of the dance frustrated because it could have been fantastic frustrated because the dancing might have been astounding frustrated because the women could have been gorgeous how would i know though by the time your eyes have moved to the area of interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the spot to be admired the insane editor has moved the shot i completely agree with the other comments here about the crappy lighting and terrible camera editor work it makes me <UNK> just watching ten minutes of this would be spectacular movie br br give me an opportunity to get a front seat to the live concert and i would be there in a shot br br nicholas t
<START> making a film for under 1 million might be a triumph for a line producer or an <UNK> but doesn't do anything for the audience the balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor br br what will be a triumph for irish cinema is when people realise that production values and the script can't be sacrificed br br i don't understand why people <UNK> the energy it takes to put a film together when the production quality is worse than a low grade tv show br br the <UNK> of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and i totally agree with what was written what i would add is that the film <UNK> the surface of several genres without ever <UNK> in one of them the film would have <UNK> from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social political commentary br br my overall impression was that the film was rushed <UNK> under developed and visually not up to standard on a positive note the performances and music were very good
<START> this movie was so dumb and slow was it ever slow the only good part of the film was the girl in the tight gold pants there was no gore and what is a 80's horror movie without a little gore plus the killer wasn't at all scary nor were the murders but if you like to watch the world's worst horror movie then this is for you don't waste your time like i did watching this
<START> for the first fifteen minutes the story of naked fame is interesting two late thirties male porn stars in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try for the world of singing and acting the two very buff and <UNK> men are <UNK> ford and blake <UNK> with the aid of kevin and marc <UNK> <UNK> makes a dance track that is then <UNK> in new york with the hopes that <UNK> ford will become an instant star a unique disco singer <UNK> his background as a porn star for <UNK> br br the remainder of the film is <UNK> and in fighting and commentary by porn producer <UNK> <UNK> and the film slowly sinks into <UNK> and <UNK> not a bad idea for a film if there were a bit more depth revealed in each character's drive to move away form a successful career though one greatly influenced by the youth both characters have lost into an alternative one it is just that a one note song wears thin quickly grady <UNK> november <UNK>
<START> after the return of horror movies come on scream isn't scary i didn't have very high hopes for this low budget three story horror movie but i was positively surprised man this is scary the first 2 stories are simply brilliant the first one about a new <UNK> couple driving in a dark forest with their <UNK> when they <UNK> into a fierce watch the movie the second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl who is home alone for one night i know it doesn't sound any special but it is scary i promise you the last story isn't scary but <UNK> not bad it's about a biker and a <UNK> in fact the stories are based on real urban legends i guess kevin <UNK> can steal ideas too rent this movie it is good i'd say <UNK> the scariest three short story horror movie ever made
<START> this version of the lost horizon is actually not a bad film at all i think the problem is people like to pick on musicals especially those made in the 70s i saw the film upon its original release in 1973 i was ten and really enjoyed it the music especially burt <UNK> has always been a favorite the story is fun the acting is good and technically it's excellent sure there are one or two rather silly dance numbers but hey you can't win 'em all i have this film on video and watch it every so often and i enjoy it each and every time
<START> this movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap first let me talk about the pros sandra <UNK> in a black bathing suit br br now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad we have said computer <UNK> angela bennett who's online profile is angel how witty i bet the directors <UNK> over that one for an hour who basically <UNK> other <UNK> <UNK> for errors <UNK> etc so we start with her <UNK> pizza on the internet and then putting on a <UNK> on her <UNK> extreme computer skills shown thus far this is after she finds some virus on a <UNK> program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key this is apparently a huge problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple <UNK> file br br any event we move on she gets this call from some other bloke that works at the same company and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret internet <UNK> to a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> data <UNK> angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this <UNK> are out to get her this of course is only after she <UNK> up with one of the bad guys only before he tries to kill her before she jumps in the ocean off his boat before she winds up in a random hospital br br problem 1 you can't create a <UNK> on the internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret fbi data where the hell did this come from since when can a group of <UNK> control the basic flow of the internet even in 95 problem 2 angela would need proper <UNK> before a hospital or clinic would release her she could not just pack her things and go br br then these or whatever change <UNK> id so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her id is gone so she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on br br apparently all police and fbi people are stupid and don't believe her so then she has to <UNK> a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works where the person who is now filling in for her is and get back to her old computer she starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some <UNK> <UNK> address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe br br then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the fbi she apparently has to use a <UNK> to email stuff to the fbi but then the same fool that tried to kill her before throwing her in the water catches her and easily <UNK> into the fbi again wtf but remember that cool virus well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on <UNK> it now works on the entire system too it brings down the whole <UNK> which has all the fake information because the <UNK> was just sitting in the middle of some convention what the hell is this crap anyway the now uber virus works and angela the real one now runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire <UNK> he of course has a gun runs up to her so he's like 2 feet away and then decides to aim classic hollywood br br all in all this movie is so full of <UNK> and crap anyone who doesn't know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers or the net and i honestly doubt i'd see a virus for mac and a <UNK> computer <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where max is choosing a ring in a shop much of what follows reminds us of shakespeare's a mid summer <UNK> dream in which and fall in love with each other's girl friends here max and <UNK> both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with lisa and alice and alice <UNK> things when she calls herself lisa on top of the merry mix up max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago and because max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film i wasn't quite sure if i was in the present or the past there is much running down corridors through <UNK> into <UNK> etc i accept all that in a fast paced film but do we have to have so many people <UNK> with each other after four <UNK> it <UNK> to have any impact if you'll excuse the pun high marks for art design the apartment itself is really beautiful with its <UNK> <UNK> but i do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in paris saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when max almost <UNK> at the same time however a kiss or two soon makes him feel better if you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks you'll finally find yourself at the airport where <UNK> devoted sister gives him a most <UNK> kiss it can be said it is she who <UNK> the complications of love like <UNK> in a mid summer <UNK> dream
<START> geoffrey wright the director of <UNK> <UNK> shakespeare's <UNK> in the contemporary criminal underworld of melbourne australia the result is a semi awful piece of cinema sam is <UNK> and walks around looking very self conscious and bored victoria hill who wrote the script with wright is lady <UNK> and she's neither awful nor good <UNK> <UNK> who plays is the only actor in the cast who exudes any kind of authority the rest including gary sweet are wasted and <UNK> shot on <UNK> by the late will gibson the movie's visuals lack character everything is too clean and too deliberately lit <UNK> direction is uninspired in the extreme and the action sequences are confusing and inept <UNK> <UNK> as the most violent australia movie ever the film is violent at times and reasonably bloody but it fails to deliver a single <UNK> moment slow moving and terribly pretentious this <UNK> silver screen version of the classic play is the <UNK> of wrong headed
<START> ok so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever there is no spoken dialogue no subtitles not even any real characters you see three people in the entire movie that are alive and two are just there for very little reason the main guy has no emotion and just <UNK> corpses for no apparent reason that is the entire movie i love to see very gory movies especially since in america real gore just isn't very common in modern movies so yeah the gore effects were pretty cool but it just isn't really disturbing why does everyone think it's so disturbing there are no characters at all there are just 3 living people and 3 corpses no one has any personality or back story you see three corpses being <UNK> apart and you can't really identify with it unless you just identify with death itself and how this could very well happen despite the guy losing his job and going to jail very shortly after to be disturbing the viewer has to care and to care they have to identify with the victim for example in a good horror movie you should really care about the main character here it's just a guy and a corpse it's as deep as a <UNK> made from only a single rain drop they never give you any reason to care about anyone in the movie all it is a guy <UNK> up a few bodies then he has sex with a body now with the sex scene here is an odd thing about it he makes sure to wear <UNK> but doesn't use a <UNK> so he couldn't care less about catching some weird <UNK> from having sex with a corpse but as long as his hands don't get messy there is no problem now that is really logical i don't really dislike the movie i liked that it was very gory but when it ends there is no reason to watch it again no reason to even care and it just isn't a very compelling movie i say if you can find it for under 10 dollars then you might as well get it but if it's more than that it just isn't worth it
<START> in this approximately <UNK> second thomas edison produced short we see <UNK> moore performing the fuller choreographed <UNK> dance in two different <UNK> flowing <UNK> br br moore was one of the bigger stars of the late victorian era she was featured in a number of edison company shorts including this one which was among the first <UNK> films shown in london in <UNK> br br fuller had actually <UNK> the <UNK> dance which moore performs here in <UNK> as well as entire frames that are frequently hand <UNK> in the film <UNK> one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era supposedly the moore films were popular enough to have to be frequently <UNK> including the version available to us now may be a later version remake moore became even more popular when it was <UNK> that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in new york city she later went on to star as the gibson bathing girl in the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> she appeared there until <UNK> br br the short is notable for its framing of motion which especially during the second half becomes almost abstract it somewhat resembles a morris louis painting even though this is almost 60 years before <UNK> relevant work br br you should be able to find this short on dvd on a number of different <UNK> of early films
<START> as stated by others this is a <UNK> horrible movie not a film it is not bad in a funny way just painful to try to endure don't waste your time br br erika <UNK> is pretty hot but there is one scene where she is in a <UNK> and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the <UNK> also she's getting fat br br the fight scenes are so bad as to be unwatchable if you know or care anything about martial arts or even decent choreography and the editing effects are abysmal br br there is no payoff it goes nowhere and sucks getting there
<START> has aged really well still thrilling and suspenseful today certainly one of <UNK> best movies beautifully shot with a great premise for suspense sex appeal provided by beautiful ruth roman because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end if you find yourself losing faith in <UNK> and <UNK> his title as the master of suspense i recommend this nice little movie as an <UNK> 5 out of 5
<START> 2 is harmless <UNK> and plot less i would add brainless to that list but the movie within a movie gimmick although not done very well helps it to <UNK> escape that label the scenery has changed from the california <UNK> to the greek islands and the only returning cast members from the first film are <UNK> the <UNK> guy and <UNK> collins who at one point falls into a mud pit bringing back memories of her classic <UNK> with pam <UNK> in the big doll house all the other actors are new but apparently brad is supposed to be playing the same character <UNK> as grant <UNK> did in this sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie and doesn't come close to matching it in the <UNK> department either of course brenda <UNK> and are both very pretty but the <UNK> roberts cindy silver <UNK> <UNK> team is <UNK> 2 is not the worst of its kind by any means but if you only want to see one of these movies the original is the one to get 1 2
<START> i had no expectations never saw previews for and enjoyed the characters contemporary music and sharp dancing in this light hearted movie even though 98 of the dialog is english great thing for me i wish the dvd had subtitles to help with some of the quick moments when the character's accent can be difficult to understand i wouldn't judge this movie against bollywood films but just on it's own merits as fun entertainment a musical people movie br br i'm hooked on ali as an actress and her interviews in the bonus material indicate she is a nice person i have since watched this movie several times gets better each time
<START> like most sports movies it's not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it as a soccer <UNK> i have yet to see a movie or tv show get it right when depicting a match forever has good actors but i found sean <UNK> to be a bit young to be an <UNK> in a juvenile jail i was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into <UNK> players and taking on <UNK> as well as <UNK> which gets to <UNK> a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the <UNK> baddies are <UNK> rick <UNK> even though <UNK> is not a <UNK> high school sport <UNK> the team is a school based club sport much like <UNK> that said i find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds that just isn't done in this day of aids and <UNK> i don't care what the tradition and macho image is despite that it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults and sometimes actually did sadly far too many <UNK> are like or worse
<START> when i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world she has beautiful and charming body when cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body i think male have hard to resist i think its time for cute girls like <UNK> <UNK> also do nude scenes at least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like <UNK> <UNK> to c in <UNK> queen i <UNK> with what b has said the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of <UNK> on the original content emotions aren't conveyed properly i guess a couple of not so good performances also contributed to its mediocrity in my view <UNK> would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of <UNK> <UNK> in some of her scenes she looks a bit <UNK> which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed i also noticed a bit of over acting in some of her scenes i'm a bitter critic of <UNK> <UNK> can't help it sorry for that was a good movie by and i saw <UNK> <UNK> after seeing <UNK> i was not at all impressed
<START> i watched a long time ago i <UNK> if i'd tell that i remember it in detail what i remember most vividly is the <UNK> it <UNK> me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the director's br br supposedly is a critic of presenting us i'm an <UNK> too as little people who take credit for and even <UNK> about petty ridiculous <UNK> and think we're the best thing that god who is also an <UNK> created i'm not going to argue that it's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population the part i despise by the way and even if this weren't true that's not my point the worst sin committed was to express such a statement about its own director br br the continuous impression i received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for <UNK> a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good even a mediocre movie many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless the director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones and there's no plot at all br br moreover this movie proudly presents a <UNK> <UNK> before the opening titles only to <UNK> its principles afterwards for example by including the director in the credits another sign of his pride br br i found the movie offensive not as an <UNK> but as a watcher i felt <UNK> is simply one of the worst movies i've ever seen
<START> i like money i stumbled on this brilliant film in a local video store last week wasn't sure what to expect brought it home set up the player and then my journey in to stupidity began the first viewing i did a lot of <UNK> no laughing out loud really it wasn't until the second viewing the movie really started to take a hold on me and the humor was that much funnier it reminded me of austin powers first viewing it was all right then the real fun began telling people about it just talking about each scene and the set up i'm making all my friends watch this movie everyone i know this movie may very well be one of the most accurate future movies ever made this movie is more then just <UNK> minutes of entertainment it's a warning to the future of our civilization mike judge the fantastic mind who brought us office space has brought us a vision of life in the <UNK> future luke <UNK> dead pan humor as average joe enhanced the movie that much more watch this movie then once you're done read more write more think more for the <UNK> sake if not for your own
<START> cheesy 80's horror co starring genre ken <UNK> and <UNK> cash along with brenda <UNK> are some of the featured players in this tale about a haunted health club goofy dialogue and some nasty gore effects make this movie watchable not bad but no great shakes either br br recommended for the bad dialogue and acting b movie fans only br br b
<START> ho hum just another flick with steven seagal pretending to be some spiritual being but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing he of course <UNK> it in the end by <UNK> the money to an <UNK> how sweet lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl this time he is <UNK> with ice cool anthony <UNK> gotta have someone to lay all those cringe inducing lines on man and there are plenty the dialog is pure crap br br they go after bad guys nick <UNK> and kevin <UNK> two people that were born to play the <UNK> br br he's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> soap star sarah how cute br br i guess if you gotta have some july force excitement this may suffice if nothing else it will help you get your degree in
<START> ignore the comment before mine the show is comic genius most underrated show ever 3 reasons why reason 1 the flashbacks are hilarious who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story they make me laugh so hard it hurts and isn't that the idea of a good comedy programme people who think this isn't funny just have no sense of humour who cares if they are random its a t v show you can do what ever you like with it and people say its not realistic neither is a cartoon its animated reason 2 the jokes are just generally hilarious seth <UNK> and the other writers are funny everything from the star wars references to making fun of celebrities i love them all and reason 3 the story lines are just brilliant and funny they set up all of the jokes with their crazy nature and <UNK> just all the more funnier br br i caught this one late night on <UNK> and have never gone back i have all 7 seasons plus the kind of movie thing <UNK> the <UNK> story i have several t shirts posters and my collection is still growing i've never got a collection of any tv show before but this was so funny i just had to get everything br br just watch season 3 and trust me you will be hooked for life the funniest show ever created and i hope it never ends
<START> i think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it is hilariously funny from start to finish the plot is simple and straight forward but it keeps you watching and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it when i went to see this movie i hadn't heard much about it and i didn't know what to expect i thought it was going to be an old <UNK> type of film like <UNK> girls or something but it took me completely by surprise even though i am still a teenager and the film was probably not directed at my age group i still found it excellent and i think that people of all age groups would like it i think it is a shame that it is not at all famous and it deserves more publicity so that more people will go and see it and realize what a great movie it is
<START> this show is the worst show ever norris and his family write it produce it direct it etc etc the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain no trees no building just <UNK> thin air he always <UNK> the case or is the best at whatever skill there is no co star ever gets the glory its all norris its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content terrible acting terrible script terrible series
<START> this is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary i have ever seen the images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning on top of that it is a wonderful learning experience i'm not one for educational documentaries but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end you'll be so hooked and <UNK> by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching tv this series is available to buy on dvd and i highly recommend picking this one up with all the evil and death in this world this documentary series gives us proof that life is beautiful and worth saving and <UNK>
<START> holy cow what a piece of sh t this movie is i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie i guess they didn't know either i don't remember any <UNK> or <UNK> in the book do you br br they took this all times <UNK> classic added some <UNK> <UNK> and sexual <UNK> and <UNK> it into a <UNK> joke this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like i have to say visually it was interesting but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor if you even think that kind of thing is funny i don't want the kids that i know to think it is br br don't take your kids to see don't rent the dvd i hope the ghost of doctor <UNK> ghost comes and <UNK> the people that made this movie
<START> this film and the 1st film both all over the whole aliens and predator franchise br br they are awful films badly acted badly scripted and terribly directed they just seem like <UNK> desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out quality production they came up with the br br the original alien aliens predator predator 2 films were great they <UNK> the horror thriller genre by <UNK> these insane and yet still believable creatures who took the role of the <UNK> <UNK> as opposed to a human br br these films are just <UNK> the franchise and do nothing but <UNK> its name br br the aliens vs predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story they were true to the alien predator mythology didn't crap all over the original stories etc why didn't they make the comic book into a great film because hollywood are idiots thats why
<START> here is another low quality movie from the disney company there is no more disney spirit the story is boring all emotions are fake it is not cute or moving disney company was at a time a sort of magic company which provided dreams for children it is now all about making money shame on the people who exploit disney name for their personal benefit it is the fall of an empire and by the way pixar is not disney
<START> i have been an avid jane austen fan for many years i had never seen this adaptation so when i had heard of it i came here and read all the excellent reviews on that basis i eagerly ordered it from netflix what a cruel disappointment they have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression a single tone upon which to base their flat characters although this adaptation seems to have used every word that jane austen wrote they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion even though it was done as a miniseries this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as rushed as if it had been done as a movie of the week br br mr bennett too harsh mrs <UNK> just a <UNK> <UNK> mr <UNK> as lifeless as a <UNK> the bennett girls almost <UNK> and mr a man who no one would look twice at hardly the appealing <UNK> i'm quite put out
<START> while watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard tv movie though through out the picture the plot changes if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot are by the book and unoriginal and with every one the movie kept getting worse br br <UNK> cameron <UNK> famous for her role as dj <UNK> on the hit tv show full house is not very convincing as a possessed twenty something trying to avenge the death i believe she is fine actress just not in the thriller range br br the filming was trashy and like i said the plot stale though watching it i knew i was in for automatic cheese i had no idea how much worse this film could get br br i highly do not recommend this movie unless <UNK> <UNK> and poor writing is what you looking for
<START> i was <UNK> this dvd by the director of a film i am working with in which i play an actor who is playing <UNK> knowing his own style i did not expect anything resembling a classical interpretation of the text br br what i have found is sometimes striking sometimes <UNK> but often meandering and tedious like most experimental music i find that in films such as this the building <UNK> of powerful film making are crafted even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format br br thus we have a who is more a clown than a threat and who not even miranda seems terribly afraid of which is odd since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once a <UNK> and who are more annoying than funny an oddly young <UNK> who looks like <UNK> and a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized <UNK> br br interestingly enough i do not have an issue with the way in which or miranda are portrayed his stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate br br i do not say that this is a bad film but an experimental one one that takes huge risks but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the <UNK> for its own sake
<START> when it comes to any movie that was made in or about the south the characters are labeled racist or <UNK> or even worse that awful racist term <UNK> this movie was a murder mystery plain simple it was a great murder mystery did demonstrate some of human feelings about each others race the same type of observations made by black character actors toward in <UNK> movies before watching this movie one should get the <UNK> burning chip off of <UNK> shoulder enjoy the plot wonderful acting reminiscent scenes of simpler times that while are gone they will not be forgotten mr <UNK> did his hometown of <UNK> miss justice by having this movie shot there the producer noted while shooting the movie there his stereotypical perception of whites were that he observed white black <UNK> locals getting along with each other in the same way so sit back enjoy one of mr great classics try to figure out who the killer really is
<START> clint howard brother of more talented ron stars in this <UNK> awful horror comedy about a mental case who serves ice cream to children and kills people <UNK> to be a movie that's of the <UNK> bad that it's <UNK> variety this film misses that mark by a good mile and instead has to be seen as <UNK> bad that it's well <UNK> it's the constant cinema the <UNK> stuffed <UNK> <UNK> or the sleep inducing <UNK> that <UNK> me on the film i don't know all i know is i <UNK> the film and this from a guy who has a soft spot for b horror films paul norman choose to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after this his only <UNK> film a wise choice indeed as horrible acting nonsense storyline and ludicrous dialog are much much more <UNK> while seeing a porn <UNK> do her thing <UNK> enough this turkey has absolutely no nudity another reason to steer clear br br my grade d
<START> oh god why didn't you give this money for charity i thought i saw the lowest crap by now but i was wrong who did this script anyway a retarded who did this cast i can't believe that there are people that spend money and time to do garbage like that i was under the impression that i'm watching a porn movie only without sex scenes that bad was the so called acting did this film have a director i believe not and i'm convince that everybody had upon them a page with some lines and red it in front of the camera i can't explain myself how all the characters in this garbage died without a fight nobody can do lower than this please <UNK> it even from imdb <UNK>
<START> i purchased this video on vcr tape in a good will store for us 50 cents i have taken quite a few videos i purchased back for them to sell to others after i viewed them considering the 50 <UNK> cost as a rental this is the only one that will never go back it is an explosion of artistic talent color and sound i don't know if i should calls it circus dance or both it is bigger than life itself they will only be able to do this well for just a few brief years in their life these are the performers for the performers if gene kelly and burt <UNK> were alive today and saw them live they would be awe struck i would lend it to others to watch but i know if i do that i will never get it back
<START> sometimes when seeking a movie nothing will do except a good thriller dead line certainly fits the bill br br a little warning however if you are going to watch this film you are better off not knowing too much <UNK> about the plot br br the plot <UNK> as the film goes by a really remarkably well built tension <UNK> br br it is deep and horrifying it goes all the way to the darkest places in human mind br br the plot also has some very surprising shifts br br just wait till <UNK> turn off the light and watch this film
<START> this is a very interesting <UNK> two <UNK> tales contains three foolish and childish episodes genre isn't actually horror or action more like something in between where's the <UNK> where's the fun where's the common sense definitely not in here but if you don't expect to get it you don't necessarily miss it br br first segment is called showdown it's a violent absurd western i failed to understand the whole idea of it king of the road is a stupid story starring brad pitt at the time of two <UNK> tales he was just a pretty face who really didn't know how to act yet luckily he learned the skill later and now he's a fantastic talented actor one of the big ones of the younger generation story is almost ok in all of it's <UNK> final episode yellow is the only segment that's almost entirely successful it's foolish but funny we have to thank kirk douglas for that br br this movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn i should know that's what i did if you loved tales from the crypt you'll love two <UNK> tales too because basically it's all the same i understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare piece of art and very difficult to find anywhere i have the whole package on vhs but i don't think it's a big <UNK> you'll have to be a fanatic brad pitt fan to search it out otherwise don't bother it's not worth the effort silly crap
<START> i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i must say it was simply awesome for those of you whom loves 'the never ending <UNK> this is one that would bring back memories of that movie even though it is a 1996 movie it has a <UNK> like setting and look which makes it feel like it is a fantasy the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning battle song and end song to those of you who have yet to see it watch it i recommended completely
<START> this is definitely a must see film the excellent director <UNK> <UNK> also acting as <UNK> has managed to capture the very essence of the adventures of the french comic books it's based upon and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which is also an homage to the world of animated films this movie is so funny so full of jokes both visual and spoken that it might take you two or three <UNK> before you notice them all between your bursts of laughter the only <UNK> is that a non french audience or at least a non french speaking audience might not get all the private jokes there are so many dialogues impossible to translate so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life that the fun might be <UNK> however it's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture the amazing stunts the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting all actors are great but the film would not be the same without <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and please don't ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books et <UNK> <UNK> and directed by claude
<START> <UNK> spoilers <UNK> <UNK> anthony hopkins is back for a travesty of a movie now he's in italy <UNK> our food including people such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but comes back to the states for <UNK> <UNK> moore and to even the score with a former victim mason <UNK> gary <UNK> br br let me tell you this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with silence of the <UNK> and <UNK> because it's truly completely absolutely totally bad br br i mean the scene near the end with ray <UNK> <UNK> being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain wtf then why the hell was everybody so annoying including <UNK> and why did the story keep going nowhere i suppose that this is the chapter of the <UNK> series terrible stupid gory for <UNK> sake and totally embarrassing br br don't watch it especially if you love any other of the <UNK> movies <UNK> red dragon <UNK> rising br br <UNK> 1 10
<START> i have seen both the mst3k version and the uncut version i rather enjoyed it either way it wasn't that bad of a movie sure it moved a bit slow at times i liked it br br as far as mst3k goes they only did the movies they could get the rights for not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies it was just so easy to make fun of them take for example br br joe <UNK> and robert characters where so <UNK> and <UNK> silly i couldn't help but laugh i couldn't take them seriously it really created a unique feeling though br br vivian <UNK> did an excellent job with the script a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today her role was played well not too not to <UNK> but just right the camera really likes her in this movie i would have casted her in that role after ready the script br br anyways this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given please watch the uncut version if you see the mst3k it deserves that much
<START> as many of the other comments i have read have noted i fell in love with this movie when i was a kid my sister and i had a copy of the movie on <UNK> before vhs that we wore out of course it didn't help when our parents sold the <UNK> at a garage sale since then we have been trying to find a copy i like another <UNK> did eventually locate a rental copy at a local video store the owner would not part with the copy after any number of attempts to beg <UNK> and cry my way to <UNK> the tape good news i bought a brand new newly released vhs copy of midnight madness for 9 99 on amazon com two days ago finally disney has <UNK> up now if they'll only song of the south if you love the movie grab it if you haven't seen the movie it's worth a check totally stupid humor but a lot of fun stephen <UNK> is hilarious
<START> before going any further i have to admit that i only saw the first episode of this show if i had the time i might have considered watching it every week if only to see how the season played out however it was very clear to me from the beginning that martha stewart's version of the apprentice just doesn't fit in martha stewart made a career of being a happy <UNK> a domestic <UNK> of the likes of oprah <UNK> and julia child it was only since her <UNK> legal troubles and subsequent <UNK> that her public image began to reflect the true <UNK> of her character sure she was compelling for a while and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business does she have to come off as cold and tough shouldn't she br br but the truth was by the time stewart came out of prison her attempts for a public comeback though certainly <UNK> were never going to <UNK> <UNK> interest for very long perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home <UNK> and waited a year or so after her often <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was removed instead she <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> with 2 series at once the other being her <UNK> daytime series martha much like her old show but more mainstream with famous guests like bette midler of course even at her peak stewart was never mainstream so it's too much to ask that american audiences immediately accept her <UNK> into reality tv maybe america wants stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it br br the show was basically a tired <UNK> of <UNK> apprentice which still holds my interest depending on the tasks the cast and <UNK> firing decisions often controversial likely for that reason the letter bit was certainly not cliché but obnoxious in the least the fact that stewart never says you're fired mentioned in the message board on this site is particularly <UNK> producer mark <UNK> should be admired for dealing with stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice <UNK> again never mainstream stewart lacks the and of oprah <UNK> and the admirable charismatic <UNK> of donald <UNK> yes this can be a gender biased <UNK> of her character but i mean it to be more about the nature of her business br br it comes as no shock that stewart has been fired but i wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season
<START> i'm a fan of low budget b movies and campy horror flicks but this was too much even for me br br if you can get past the weak plot the cheesy effects and the uninspired acting then the horrible writing will kill you or you'll wish it would the dialog was most likely written by high school <UNK> who thought that saying sir yes sir over and over again made these guys sound more military br br the characters were all the typical cardboard stereotypes <UNK> ho <UNK> sorta <UNK> ho other guy with sensitive side evil scientist with secret agenda bald or course bitchy <UNK> chick who would be hot if she tried too dumb sexy chick with vital piece of information idiot genius nerd random other sorta military <UNK> who die soon enough and spoiler character alert crazy scientist who was in charge until something went horribly wrong oh yeah i almost forgot there is a secret military navy submarine sitting on the ocean floor 5 minutes from <UNK> or so it seems full of <UNK> <UNK> ok and dead bodies your mission is vague and poorly defined br br if you watch this don't say you weren't warned
<START> this movie <UNK> too far from novel for me to enjoy barely made it to the middle of the film besides changing don from <UNK> nephew into his son the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life what was left was trash version was far superior to this poorly executed film i don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the <UNK> society members either hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime i just hate when hollywood <UNK> the works of talented authors because they think their version so much better makes me sick
<START> as soon as the credits rolled on saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back br br watching those iconic moments where christopher <UNK> met <UNK> <UNK> was the beginning of a huge long adventure br br with this new series it brings with it in which the previous version of the show lacked for the emotion between the doctor and his companion which they seemed to dismiss in the old series as well as the doctor actually falling in love with a companion and receiving her love in return yet as we know the doctor shall forever remain lonely as the end of season 2 proved he could not stay with a companion forever watching those moments your eyes filling with tears as the doctor says his final farewell to the only companion he has ever loved were moments beautifully written and acted br br this show however proved it can live on as the doctor meets many other companions along his lonely yet exciting journey through his never ending life br br new doors and secrets every episode it's a sure show for the family to enjoy br br as christopher <UNK> once described the show the journey of a lifetime
<START> oh dear oh dear oh dear br br to think that films such as this were made and probably enjoyed by thousands at drive ins really <UNK> the mind how innocent we were in those days br br to put it <UNK> this film is crap the hero is so wet you can hear his <UNK> <UNK> footsteps in every scene my lord but he's just one of a whole slew of awful awful actors that appear in this turkey no wonder mst3k picked it the story such as it is <UNK> around a stock car driver who is so incompetent you really believe it is the actor driving the car that he gives up and gets in with the wrong crowd <UNK> scary stuff however the wrong crowd turn out to be the biker equivalent of the three stooges and their hand me round slut of a biker chick as an example of how lame this whole thing is the writers obviously <UNK> their brains to come up with a frightening name for the biker gang if four people can be called a gang that is the result the gang is called <UNK> angels i kid you not br br such dire acting and dialogue along with ridiculous scenes make for a wonderful beer and <UNK> movie but otherwise its just the worst kind of rubbish br br as i said once this may have been considered good but today it just makes you laugh and cringe with every minute that goes by avoid it except for a good laugh and make sure you're more than half drunk too
<START> this show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar <UNK> with the pretty and sometimes <UNK> seeming wife and crazy in law s with this show it's fat unfunny comedian kevin james as doug who works as a delivery driver for a <UNK> service he has a pretty wife carrie <UNK> who works as legal assistant and <UNK> father in law arthur <UNK> jerry stiller who lives in his daughter and son in <UNK> basement kevin <UNK> doug is your typical beer drinking sports loving tv watching <UNK> of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues he also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show's couple beyond the few laughs <UNK> by jerry <UNK> crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny kevin <UNK> <UNK> behavior usually caused the show's problems that usually resolved by his wife this show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on abc for some reason
<START> being a huge horror movie fan one of the most difficult things to be considering the lack of abundance of good movies in the genre and having seen hundreds of them in my lifetime i have to say that dracula 3000 is by far the most uninspired lame and poorly done piece of trash i have had the misfortune to see stay away from this movie it's so bad it's not even laughable the special effects did i say special were probably achieved spending a couple of grand the acting is terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash bin after the first read by the studio that decided to take on this miserable project the whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse also for you guys out there who like nudity in your movies don't be fooled by the r rating if you're thinking you get a chance to see erika <UNK> even half naked you're wrong she is fully <UNK> throughout the entire movie and the cover art is completely misleading there is no scene in any part of the movie that even <UNK> resembles the awesome cover art they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fans br br too bad the rating is only 1 to 10 i would give this movie a 10 be warned don't waste your money or your time on this one
<START> <UNK> is one of the best <UNK> releases ever br br better than this game well star wars rogue <UNK> star wars episode i <UNK> and the legend of <UNK> <UNK> of time are far better and superior games but i still love <UNK> br br this is the best adaptation from a movie second only to star wars adaptations the story is perfect it's like you are in the movie itself br br the graphics are excellent the movements are extremely realistic the <UNK> artificial intelligence are the best part in this game i loved playing the stage in which james and break from the <UNK> base as the <UNK> <UNK> to burn it escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult <UNK> cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects in the <UNK> br br it's also the <UNK> game i've ever played <UNK> games are usually very very easy <UNK> is the one exception i'm still trying to beat the 00 agent difficult level but winning the easier levels was already a great victory i loved when alec asked for england james i answered no for me it happened just in the moment i <UNK> him to death just like in the movie i love <UNK> every objective br br the <UNK> <UNK> is even better at first i got killed every holy second now i know how to win i love forcing my <UNK> by playing at license to kill br br the music and sound are astounding super mario 64 looks like an <UNK> next to this the only thing i still wanted to hear was the <UNK> theme song that plays at the end of the movie br br after <UNK> was released i nearly forgot i still had this game it's still excellent even if it's already <UNK> i hope other <UNK> games are produced br br fantastic job <UNK> was very smart to release this game on the <UNK> exclusively magnificent job <UNK>
<START> the movie is about a futuristic video game on a <UNK> system that is almost like virtual reality the only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer jennifer jason leigh unless it can be <UNK> the many years and <UNK> million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste the only way to <UNK> the game however is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust jude law this movie was pretty good but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film the best thing about this film were the twists toward the end definitely worth seeing 7 10
<START> larry clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director but he has made some undeniably important films kids bully and to a lesser extent ken park all achieve their intended purpose shock <UNK> and even disgust these films are <UNK> in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth kids exposed us to the <UNK> of a i d s and sexual <UNK> among the young bully touched upon similar issues ken park dealt somewhat ham <UNK> with sexual abuse and suburban <UNK> <UNK> all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth br br <UNK> <UNK> is about a group of poor hispanic from south central las angeles who go to <UNK> go to beverly hills to <UNK> that's it br br <UNK> <UNK> is nothing br br it has no substance it has an essentially nonexistent narrative and like kids it features a cast of first time actors who were drawn out of the films setting however unlike kids none of them have any semblance of talent there is better acting in porn this film features without a doubt the most terrible performances i've ever seen in a feature film one can respect larry clark to exposing these young men to the film making process but these kids are absolutely cringe worthy folks might i add that apparently these <UNK> also produced the soundtrack which features some of the most <UNK> inept garage punk you'll ever hear my advice is to pop a couple of <UNK> <UNK> before you enter the theater or you'll regret it afterward br br but then again it's not like they had much of a script to work with every line that is <UNK> is a contrived <UNK> delivered and irritating beyond all measure the story itself is ludicrous it starts out reasonably enough but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity this begins of course with a <UNK> with a pair of rich white girls followed by a series of clichéd national encounters characters being killed off for no reason and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti climax shots go on much longer than they need to be prepared to watch people fall of <UNK> for about fifteen minutes straight overlong lingering shots of characters doing nothing or <UNK> down streets but then again with the script at a <UNK> <UNK> pages they need as much useless filler as possible perhaps <UNK> <UNK> would have worked better as a short film br br anyways i could go on like this this is the worst film larry clark has made yet for those of you who are interested in seeing a clark movie if only for his shocking <UNK> antics look elsewhere this is by far the <UNK> film he's made yet and it's also the worst it's flat out horrible like uwe boll horrible definitely the worst one i saw at the festival br br 1 10
<START> what was bruce willis thinking when he signed on for this one this one made no sense to me i was so confused by it it <UNK> funny at all i dont even know why disney made this one bruce is a great actor whom <UNK> liked for a long time and this disappointed me a lot pass this one by on the video shelf
<START> a paranoid scientist creates a <UNK> by wolf blood into a meek quiet but very large <UNK> in order to prove an <UNK> so the <UNK> begins <UNK> <UNK> and the scientist tries to use him to <UNK> his <UNK> but is <UNK> by his former colleagues for <UNK> with nature island of dr <UNK> frankenstein and various <UNK> films all <UNK> together into a terribly dated goofy morality play br br though the subject matter is <UNK> and unoriginal at best this film is not too poorly made and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time like most mad scientist films this is a weak warning against <UNK> around with mother nature it doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of frankenstein but it doesn't ever <UNK> its reach anyway the acting is passable as is the cinematography and the film moves along at an entertaining clip some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous but hey it's just a movie and a b minus one at that there are also a few nice shots of a wolf and a <UNK> of humor tossed in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously always a plus for this genre
<START> br br lets <UNK> murders your wife my father seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers bruno anthony and guy haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey guy a solid respectable <UNK> player whose problem is that his wife the <UNK> <UNK> won't divorce him so he can marry <UNK> daughter anne laughs the whole conversation off as a joke the following week he isn't laughing any more in a scene of classic hitchcock suspense bruno stalks <UNK> through a carnival and <UNK> her as he does her glasses fall off and we see the murder <UNK> reflected twice through her <UNK> cold hearted and amoral bruno his part of the deal completed approaches an appalled guy expecting even <UNK> him into <UNK> his bit ' matters are not helped when <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> younger sister turns up <UNK> guy of murder so accused of a murder he didn't commit and expected to commit another what is guy going to do the power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature and this hitchcock does to perfection
<START> no matter how much it hurts me to say this the movie is not as good as it could have been maybe i was <UNK> by the countless exaggerated reviews here on imdb but i expected so much more br br sure the idea is a good one the violent scenes and the camera work are outstanding the imagination of genius <UNK> is breathtaking but the movie is <UNK> by a couple of mistakes that i find unforgivable first of all am i one of the few people who feel that the heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes simply rips the atmosphere apart with a different kind of music <UNK> during the <UNK> scenes it would have been <UNK> intense instead the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension secondly the final killing scene and the last few moments of the movie are simply silly and uninspired i don't want to say amateurish cause i love <UNK> movies the ending left me feeling empty talk about a final impression this is hardly what happens in most of films though admittedly <UNK> also suffers from a rushed finale even if most of it is brilliant br br in short watch this movie try to make the most of its good points but be prepared for some bad ones as well this is not a perfect movie by any means
<START> i'm amazed that of all the reviews i've looked at nobody seems to have noticed one of the main points of this film or at least how i saw it it seems like one big homosexual fantasy camp clothing a <UNK> nude <UNK> a definite sexual tension between ariel and <UNK> and as a final climax a group of men in tight sailor suits dancing the this whole approach once you get used to it provides you with all sorts of fantastic scenes and images the sight of an innocent ariel being pulled towards a disgusting nude in order to perform her <UNK> and <UNK> is one of the darkest i've ever scene in a shakespeare film however by the end of the film i'd grown tired of the style and the final dance was just too much to take still overall its an interesting interpretation of the play
<START> then the second half of this movie is hard to follow i got the first part with the spanish but the film <UNK> many years forward with the french <UNK> spain the movie does little to fill you in on what happened and i don't remember much about it so the movie gets confusing then the movie begins when daughter of a rich <UNK> is accused of by the church specifically father <UNK> she is put to the question and forced to confess even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison her father forces <UNK> to sign a confession saying he is the <UNK> of a <UNK> in hopes of getting released all it does is give a reason for the church to <UNK> <UNK> who runs off to france br br then the movie <UNK> many years and the french revolution is in full force is released from prison it was very good make up work to make natalie portman look that <UNK> up she finds her family dead and seeks <UNK> for her help she tells him she had a child in prison <UNK> sets up a meeting between her and <UNK> whom is now with the french and in power he is the father <UNK> sees the daughter and tells <UNK> whom decides it's best to send her off to america so no one will find out but before his plans get carried out the british join the and spain <UNK> power and he is now the <UNK> that part is not well told in the film it's like the film shows this to happen in a day br br final verdict the movie is good until it <UNK> many years in time after the then the movie expects you to understand what is going on it just got too confusing to me then
<START> is the story only russians could tell about the second world war the largest front of the whole conflict has been ironically the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war while the western allies war effort has been <UNK> in almost every possible detail and manner the east has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value br br there is no chance that could compete with band of brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with <UNK> petty visual effects in mind that the soldiers are russians is enough big reason to forgive the less eye captivating battle scenes and you can concentrate on the story that is the most interesting so much different was the war in the eastern front and the nature of the russian army that you might wish people to produce more <UNK> from the other <UNK> and of <UNK> br br is no way perfect but it has some rare <UNK> that <UNK> the overall rating it tends to crush <UNK> people have about the second world war the true heroes were russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only <UNK> another great myth bust is that it presents the enemy who does not pick up his gun as an equal human being an <UNK> that has been difficult to try in many acclaimed films as well shows how the war in the eastern front was a war of survival and how the clash of the <UNK> <UNK> people into dust
<START> before watching this movie from beginning to end i happened to just catch the last half hour <UNK> i don't watch a movie if i haven't seen it from the beginning but a friend had it on and once i started watching it i couldn't stop br br i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release this is quite a funny movie often <UNK> humor and the monster and monster truck in it are quite menacing the monster makes <UNK> look pretty and the monster truck is a like a cross between a world war i german <UNK> vehicle and a giant coffin br br a <UNK> twenty five year old virgin guy is on a long drive to stop the woman he loves from getting married his ex best friend <UNK> along and <UNK> on him constantly they're <UNK> on the road by a vintage black <UNK> and the aforementioned monster truck they also pick up a <UNK> played by the very sexy <UNK> brooks br br i also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary and the electronic press <UNK> and i found those both to be interesting i would bet that the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is pretty enjoyable too but i have so many other movies to watch i've never seen before
<START> michael film <UNK> based on the character of the same name created by robert e howard is a disappointing fantasy action adventure film that despite having a few scenes of genius falls flat with its awkward pacing poor characterisation and general <UNK> <UNK> kane james <UNK> is a <UNK> of queen <UNK> army fighting in africa where he comes face to face with the devil's <UNK>  a demon who <UNK> the devil's <UNK> i e souls  <UNK> to go to hell just yet he <UNK> the <UNK> and starts a new life in an english monastery with this new life <UNK> has left behind his culture of violence and bloodshed and instead now <UNK> the values of peace and non values but once he is <UNK> from the monastery due to the fear of the devil's <UNK> returning he must travel back to his home in <UNK> and along the way he befriends a travelling family of <UNK> heading to the new world on their journey through the british the family is attacked and their daughter meredith rachel <UNK> wood is <UNK> by the evil <UNK> army which is lead on the front lines by the mysterious masked rider now a man of peace <UNK> must go back to his former life as a man of <UNK> violence and destruction to save meredith br br despite having great source material to work from and build upon to create potentially an exciting and enduring medieval action adventure film the film fails in three key areas the pacing of this film is terrible which may have a lot to do with its incredibly short run time of only one hour and forty minutes and this is most likely a consequence of the fact that they wish to turn this film into a trilogy constantly jumping between of drama and self characterisation to that of action and <UNK> bloodshed somewhat kills the excitement of the action sequences instead of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats <UNK> with the eagle eyed anticipation the film instead feels incredibly subdued and this follows on the next piece of criticism dull despite being <UNK> as an <UNK> <UNK> film or in some circles an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is almost most certainly not the action is mundane and dull and is generally finished before you have the chance to admire the beauty of a <UNK> finally aside from <UNK> himself there is very little characterisation within this film for example we know little and because of this care little about the young woman that sets out on his journey to save and i imagine again the filmmaker would refer this criticism to the fact that there is most likely going to be a second film which will hopefully touch upon these aspects that this film surely missed br br it isn't an entirely terrible film however james <UNK> is gives a fantastic performance as <UNK> the <UNK> who must decide whether or not to fall back on his conscience or his blade and how his decisions will impact not just upon himself but those around him as well while respect admiration and <UNK> must also go to <UNK> and his crew as well for creating vivid locations that beautifully reflects the period in which they are filming at times it is hard not to get carried away with <UNK> the beauty of the locations shot composition and <UNK> en scene at show here which certainly shows that a lot of time and effort has been placed into this film unfortunately however that is not to say the same for the story and characters at hand <UNK> certainly had the potential to be something more than simply an <UNK> epic ' however it seems that once again the lack of any real depth in the story and characters has resulted in michael <UNK> creating nothing more than a one dimensional look at <UNK> during the medieval period
<START> certainly not a great show but better than most other sitcoms out there at the moment it reminds of shows like married with children and <UNK> as they go to places not <UNK> dealt with in sitcoms it's sometimes funny even if you ignore the laugh tracks but not rip roaring hilarious br br some of the characters are pretty funny the gay friend and some of the other drop ins this is also one of the few shows where the characters <UNK> sorry for the butchered spelling actually is effective and funny br br is this an all in the family or seinfeld type show absolutely not however it is certainly better than a show like <UNK> probably the worst tv show of any type out at the moment br br oh and the mom is not too bad looking and the <UNK> character is a little <UNK>
<START> this movie i saw it 15 years ago and in the last years couldn't remember it any more name or anything else just it was about a romanian country man played superbly by anthony quinn the impression i got from this drama will be eternal finally i found the name of the movie i hope i will be able to buy it and honestly this movie worth 10 oscars ten times bravo i was quite young when i first saw the movie i asked my friends if they heard about this story but nobody would know anything about anthony quinn playing the role of a romanian <UNK> i remember when a german officer came and saw anthony and told him he was a good breed but in fact the german was cheating on him for few bucks you won't get rich in case you buy the movie but you will be rich if you have it
<START> opera is one of the greatest achievements in horror genre this masterful picture has everything what should be in the pure horror movie good captivating story a lot of symbols wonderful visuals and plenty of gore the killings are very shocking and bloody an unforgettable atmosphere of dread and fear a must see for a true <UNK> fan so if you get a chance watch it
<START> by far one of the best sci fi films out there however it does take viewings to understand the concept of the film and to be able to appreciate not only the special effect but the main plot of the film itself it is my own feelings that this film film got such poor reviews because no one took the time to watch the film the way it was meant to be seen it does have some moments you wish would hurry up and pass by but they are few and far between hooper who directed tcm 1 and 2 along with a remake of <UNK> from mars and the <UNK> does his best work here great score good acting and great effects makes this a film to add to your collection if you get the chance see the widescreen version on dvd highly recommended to any one who is a fan of sci fi
<START> it <UNK> me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this really let's forget for a second that the plot doesn't even give a single hint of originality most of the movies today are based on other <UNK> stories so a simple lack of originality is not that big a deal br br but i can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this because let's be honest that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous to be sincere i think a 6 years old child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable some examples following br br the scene that really drove me crazy is when the <UNK> turn off when they regain control of the plane when they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like ok push the 1 and 2 buttons on the <UNK> now those are not buttons they should not be pushed they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot that's something only plane addicted would know you say wrong the next scene you can see their fingers pushing the buttons and of course the so called buttons don't move at all not even a single <UNK> and note that i haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft <UNK> are not like cars engine that you just turn the key and the magic happens you have to do quite a complicated <UNK> to turn them on come on guys you could have <UNK> the movements at least not to mention the hilarious final impact where the plane crashes against every single thing along the <UNK> light <UNK> along the <UNK> what where they thinking and the wings don't even get ripped off it happened to me too once except the plane was made of <UNK> what about the flight attendant she's actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the <UNK> 1 and <UNK> 2 <UNK> are in the middle of the <UNK> behind the <UNK> should we mention then the guy that can drive an <UNK> and fly a plane behind the <UNK> using his computer and how did he turn the other airplane <UNK> on br br really i could go on hours with this stuff this is the dumbest movie i've ever come across and i'm including garbage like alone in the dark and other stuff in the list want to do yourself a favor don't watch it
<START> clever <UNK> drama about a wounded union soldier clint eastwood who seeks <UNK> in an isolated <UNK> school for young women during the civil war slowly eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight until the tables are turned and he becomes the pursued in an unsettling gothic toned finale never has a film been so deliciously erotic yet <UNK> macabre at the same time br br this is undoubtedly eastwood's finest hour those who tune in for dirty harry will indeed be surprised while the rest of the cast gives uniformly superb performances try to see the film on video as television <UNK> usually <UNK> crucial flashback scenes between <UNK> page and patrick
<START> how living the dream managed to get into the 5 in west hollywood is beyond me as it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life i should have known when the first scene opened in gasp eugene <UNK> that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their <UNK> days from high school but can't as they are such losers is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad br br then cliché the three high school losers end up in la and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting but no one works as a used car salesman the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent and they <UNK> get money from an insurance <UNK> to set up an executive <UNK> firm with no experience just showing the supposed good life in la night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad they better not have <UNK> cards br br i could go on and on about this bad film but i ended up walking out of the theater which had at the start six people and when i left four men were the only ones in the audience i wanted to like this film but i couldn't find one merit in the story characters writing dialog nor the actors whoever cast this film should <UNK> <UNK> enough
<START> this year's royal <UNK> wasn't really bad but last year's was definitely way better br br first match shawn michaels vs edge even though this match did take a little too long it was still alright edge wins after using the <UNK> to pin shawn michaels 4 10 br br second match undertaker vs in a <UNK> match now i don't really like <UNK> matches this match was boring sloppy but in the end it picked up it's pace as undertaker nailed the <UNK> then rolled in the <UNK> for the victory 4 10 br br third match <UNK> vs kurt angle vs big show in a triple threat match for the wwe women's championship not a bad triple threat match too bad <UNK> wins again to retain his title after <UNK> a <UNK> from hell on angle for the win 5 10 br br fourth match randy <UNK> vs triple h for the world <UNK> championship great match by these two men the match was a bit sloppy but it was still good it picked up pretty towards the end even though <UNK> lost the match was fast paced great towards the end <UNK> nails the <UNK> on <UNK> for the win to retain his world title 5 10 br br fifth match royal <UNK> this was a cool royal <UNK> every royal <UNK> is good after all 30 men entered the last four remaining <UNK> in the <UNK> were cena edge <UNK> <UNK> edge was able to <UNK> <UNK> out later <UNK> cena edge out together it was now up to cena <UNK> first after <UNK> an f u <UNK> went for the <UNK> bomb but suddenly both men <UNK> on the outside at the same time after a controversial decision mr <UNK> making his way to the ring to settle the matter the match was <UNK> again as <UNK> cena <UNK> it out but <UNK> got the better out of cena nailed a spine buster threw cena out to win the 2005 royal <UNK> go on to <UNK> 21 to face the champion in the 10 10 this was a very good royal <UNK> but last year's would always top every royal <UNK> in history br br overall i'll give it 8 10 b
<START> supposedly a movie about a magazine sending <UNK> to investigate reports of <UNK> with one being more or less <UNK> or <UNK> about the whole affair and the other an aussie a hardened <UNK> who laughs at the <UNK> nonsense it's all a <UNK> some kind of money making <UNK> br br turns out this movie is actually a <UNK> and a trap to actually christian <UNK> and the christian explanation of <UNK> one i've heard before this is an ad <UNK> explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern <UNK> who can fit anything and everything into their mythology the <UNK> it's real just demonic unless it takes place in a christian context then of course it is of god simple if it isn't of god it's the of the devil stupid so i suppose since <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wasn't inspired by god it must have been written under demonic influence or so would the logic lead ad br br we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe therefore there is none a version of the ad <UNK> and that god created the universe so huge so grand to show us his almighty power i think of carl <UNK> remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth it'd have been a tremendous waste of space br br so what are <UNK> they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be <UNK> christian event the <UNK> i mean rapture before the <UNK> the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en <UNK> causing mass panic confusion car and plane crashes whatever therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien <UNK> and alien <UNK> which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event all part of <UNK> plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the <UNK> br br this ad <UNK> explanation also <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by explaining away one mystery with another in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown the strange and the mysterious in as much as possible first by the known if not solely by the known br br it's like jumping straight to an alien <UNK> whenever a child is missing and <UNK> for i think i'd look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away gotten lost or been kidnapped for <UNK> or <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> before <UNK> aliens or the supernatural or satan or some such br br this kind of <UNK> or trap on the part of <UNK> is nothing new as young people are often <UNK> to free rock <UNK> that may start out with something <UNK> then suddenly switch to overt christian music followed by a <UNK> and an <UNK> call this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more <UNK> <UNK> but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death <UNK> these guys feel that anything goes any deception or <UNK> or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive which is facing serious opposition from both as well as competing <UNK> like islam the world's <UNK> growing religion which may well replace christianity as islam is far more cohesive and <UNK> and <UNK> more <UNK> than christian <UNK> although this should offer little advantage to mankind as it would be replacing one <UNK> thought system with another br br and of course the movie ends more or less with a <UNK> of <UNK> the aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told well if you are right about there being no <UNK> and death is nothing but rotting in the grave no worry but what if you're wrong br br basically statements <UNK> that reality is going to <UNK> to nothing but an viewpoint or christian fantasy is a false dilemma or black and white <UNK> even if the <UNK> are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by <UNK> nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its <UNK> that the <UNK> <UNK> are therefore correct by <UNK> br br for all we know native american <UNK> might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better br br this movie should be <UNK> right on the box caution contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes
<START> when i played the first soul <UNK> on <UNK> i thought it was great when i played the second i was hooked and finally when soul <UNK> iii was released i bought a <UNK> 2 and the game br br this can really keep you up for hours with a huge amount of characters loads of content and not to mention a great fighting system this really is the greatest fighting game to date br br the games strong points is foremost the vs <UNK> were two human players battle each other either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and <UNK> character the create character option is vast and allows the player to make thousands of different <UNK> br br the only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style <UNK> edge only kicks has to wear those ridiculous shoes br br this is absolutely the greatest fighting game one could wish for now i'm just hoping the planned movie won't be crap
<START> i have to hold barney <UNK> my head every day well i guess there must be reasons first i'm convinced that our kids are not they are just kids but they know my 1 and a half years old son <UNK> what to see what's nice or disgusting did you see the news do you think your kids have to know the reality as it is maybe or maybe not we the adults have the responsibility about what we want for our kids and what to teach them a film of drug dealers news about <UNK> in middle east of course the kids must know there is a real life but they are kids let's give them some mercy what do you want for them if you wanna have kids trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor go ahead <UNK> them lethal weapon kill bill any anime tell them <UNK> a <UNK> who enters through the <UNK> directly to <UNK> them i want <UNK> for my son don't get me wrong i'm not saying barney and friends is the best in fact the show have a lot of <UNK> i read other comments and i agree with most maybe the happiness is made of dreams or <UNK> at least i want to teach him to grow without fear but <UNK> that learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or <UNK> whom they're reasons to worth to grow that at least he can be a little happy with his own dreams so parents don't <UNK> your kids they know what they want
<START> i was fortunate enough to catch this film at the phoenix film festival and i must say that i very much enjoyed it when i asked the director if he had attended film school i was very much impressed that he had not films like these don't come from people without talent to get a start in commercials and then produce a heart felt family comedy like this shows real range i'll certainly be keeping an eye on what he does next as a good indie movie should the film is very character driven as <UNK> to your average hollywood movie which are mostly plot driven the film centers on a jewish family in new york the who have all been invited back for their fathers suicide party the film is stock full of witty quick <UNK> dialogue the fact the small jewish family is obsessed with being jewish and anyone who is jewish grounds the unrealistic situation of a suicide party in reality director jeff <UNK> does a wonderful job at pulling the characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on screen the production design brings the sets to life with lots of attention paid to small details making the setting feel like a home that's been lived in for 40 years the editing keeps up with the dialogue in such a way that it makes you sit on your seat wondering who's going to stab who with the next witty phrase or punch line and when appropriate the film slows down to let the audience dive a little deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden inside these lovable characters if you're a fan of woody allen or films like as good as it gets go see this film
<START> those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow to them and must be <UNK> if they go off with someone else fortunately human nature is much deeper than that loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering though if we are fortunate only on their death br br this film is true in setting atmosphere and dialogue to <UNK> original novel 'a way through the <UNK> and by a seemingly <UNK> dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly <UNK> lives and the depiction of english upper class country life is very accurate br br i loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an uk <UNK> dvd
<START> what a mess and i'm not referring to the destruction in the title i could go on about the hackneyed plot the lousy effects the actually notable cast <UNK> as they deliver the worst lines of their careers etc i'll just say there weren't any palm trees in chicago the last time i checked and leave it at that br br hmmm need ten lines to get this posted on imdb ok well i think a dvd release with <UNK> could be interesting maybe <UNK> will reveal what favor got called in for him to appear in this thing maybe <UNK> will show us the bag of money it must have taken to get her involved maybe cbs <UNK> will apologize
<START> apart from some quite stunning scenery this steven seagal vehicle is devoid of reasons to spend any time watching it for a seagal movie it has very little almost no action but he does put in some reasonable for him acting in contrived character development scenes not recommended to anyone
<START> well at least this was the last sequel that i could find at blockbuster because this movie was just downright horrible i mean i can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house we're talking starting a horrible fire <UNK> etc but a mirror how hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror this was the most horrible movie that could've put the title of <UNK> into the picture br br well a group of friends who are pretty much from the start are a bunch of freaks one of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy teaching me a valuable lesson don't buy things from homeless creepy guy of course the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group though i can't imagine anyone missing them br br please skip <UNK> a new generation i've already got a few complaints about my generation so i think this was a <UNK> not to sound so crazy p but believe me this is horribly acted not well thought out and not even scary i feel so bad for the original writers of the <UNK> horror they must be crying every time person witnesses this film br br 1 10
<START> the <UNK> has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family the twenty years old emily <UNK> taylor roberts is retarded due to a fall when she was one and her <UNK> mother martha <UNK> amy <UNK> blames her <UNK> for the accident the <UNK> years old <UNK> lauren <UNK> loves her sister and reads <UNK> and stories for emily their father harry <UNK> john savage a bank <UNK> lives in the basement with his models of trains and <UNK> mysteriously <UNK> her interviews for different <UNK> being rejected and teaches the of her own to emily when martha hears emily repeating the <UNK> she takes notes and shows them to the english teacher stewart worthy christopher lloyd who believes that emily has had a moment of geniuses when only friend james <UNK> reads the notes he immediately <UNK> the truth about the authority of the but when martha becomes aware she finds the reality of <UNK> a series of revelations br br is a very powerful drama about <UNK> of love and guilty complex the performances are stunning and this is the first work of lauren <UNK> from six feet under that i see and she is amazing this independent movie is an excellent choice for the viewers that are looking for a refreshing story based on the acting of the cast my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK>
<START> i was laying in bed <UNK> through the channels and boy do i have channels 500 of them with over 70 movie channels i probably watch a movie on cable once or twice a month dvd has me br br anyway i'm <UNK> through and i come to this movie and because i see portman i take interest <UNK> minutes later i am still interested how could this be when i first saw the previews to this movie in the theater i remember making fun of it i never thought i'd watch it <UNK> like it br br the story is based on a book and you can tell the movie is very episodic not like the movie has a great plot it just sucks you in may be its that performances that do it i'm pretty sure in must have been br br this movie was good for no reason br br <UNK> movie rating out of 10 7
<START> not having seen the film in its commercial debut we just caught with it via dvd expecting the worst <UNK> proved to be a pleasant experience because of the three principals in it thanks to andy <UNK> direction the film has an easy pace and while predictable the comedy has some winning moments br br <UNK> is a sort of date <UNK> for losers like albert who is not exactly what one would consider a hunk yet albert is a genuine guy who without some professional help would go <UNK> by the same women he would like to take out enter <UNK> to prepare him to overcome the obstacles that he can't overcome and even though albert stays overweight and never gets to master social <UNK> he <UNK> us because he is a real in sharp contrast with all the <UNK> making the rounds in manhattan br br the basic mistake most production <UNK> make when preparing locales for hollywood films is how out of touch with reality they are the apartments in which they these characters are so rare to find that only by the magic of the movies can these people live in places likes these evidently most of the movie people are dealing with fantasy since most city <UNK> would kill for spaces so fabulous as the ones they show in the movies let alone these same people depicted in the film would not be able to afford them br br will smith is a charismatic actor he has a <UNK> way to charm without doing much the surprise of the movie though is kevin james who as the overweight albert not only win us over but he proves he can hold his own in his scenes with mr smith eva <UNK> is fine as the main interest of <UNK> in minor roles we see adam arkin <UNK> michael <UNK> and phillip among others br br <UNK> is a fun film to watch thanks to the inspired direction by andy tenant
<START> this is a better than average entry in the saint series it holds your interest and as mysteries should keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from br br many films from the golden age are not for all tastes especially younger viewers they date themselves by clothing cars settings etc who nowadays asks for a or wears a suit and tie everywhere and the legal process was so much simpler must have been a <UNK> of lawyers back then frankly much of value is missing from those days br br in any case go with it and enjoy it's good in an old fashioned sense
<START> minor spoilers will follow br br this movie is even more odd and unconventional than songs from the second floor there is no main character we follow around there is no plot in the conventional way there is no emphasis on an happy end there is no in other words roy is back with a vengeance instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula roy concentrates his film around an idea i will not go into what that idea is but even if you don't get it i promise that you will see the greatest visual depth ever put to film the <UNK> scenes from songs pale in comparison here a work of visual <UNK> br br so be kind to your fellow man because after all we are the living and only you and i have the power to change our lives that is at least what i thought when i saw the final scene in the movie with the <UNK> <UNK> planes sweeping in over the city in the film to take our lives away br br and of course don't forget to see this movie when it gets a limited release near you this is one of those movies that actually have the power to make you a better person like de <UNK> <UNK> thieves a very warm and <UNK> film
<START> i am ashamed to say it but i have to admit the first time i saw this film was only about a year ago after seeing it i immediately rushed out and bought the dvd <UNK> edition and have watched it many times since br br the film is terrific on many levels it works as your straight monster or action type film as a horror sci fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche the incredible sense of paranoia <UNK> and fear <UNK> not only by carpenter's direction which is stunning but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general kurt russell obviously is spectacularly understated in the lead role of <UNK> and as a direct result he feels like a real person rather than a hollywood all american hero the other cast members all carry off their roles with style and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere and a truly fantastic film
<START> i saw this movie as a child and i am longing to see it again has it survived i <UNK> the 1980 version entirely as being fluff i am sure that there are many that don't feel it is necessary to <UNK> these films it is so unfortunate to discover a lost gem after it is gone young people today don't realize the <UNK> quality and the impact on one's life a film seen in early youth can have in later life this film the blue <UNK> had that effect on me how many of us have wished to find ourselves in a place removed of the fears and chaos of the modern world this was an <UNK> story of a boy and girl <UNK> on a <UNK> island there are troubles to be sure but in the end they fall in love and the have a baby life should be so simple and beautiful
<START> this was a riveting film one that really drew me in i'm a big fan of william h macy and he puts in a wonderful performance his great <UNK> coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall really gave me a sense of <UNK> in his actions i found myself waiting <UNK> for the whole house of cards to come <UNK> down around him and by <UNK> myself as his <UNK> and silent witness it took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended i was so wrapped up in it br br good performances all around too not just with macy arkin was quite good as was <UNK> he was surprisingly fierce in short i highly recommend this film to any fans of macy and or the murder mystery but you may want to prepare to feel a little guilty
<START> three young movie theater employees are given the task of re opening a long closed old time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place it seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young <UNK> employees hoping to finally make it big on their own as they approach the grand re opening night things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises br br oh this is truly horrible in fact if it wasn't for mary <UNK> secretary character being such a <UNK> independent <UNK> <UNK> young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy <UNK> this would be a total loss the only other good thing i have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive albeit not overly gory a <UNK> for me but not necessarily for others fashion the rest just <UNK> in constant sleaze so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine
<START> i have only seen this movie once when i was about 14 years old but i was thrilled that they made a movie about the division being from <UNK> and especially now that both of my sons are members of the i would like to see it released on a dvd i may sound a little bias but the division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today the history channel always talks about the other <UNK> <UNK> when it talks about ww2 and korea but you rarely hear it mention the one of the scene that really stood out for me was when the had the indian code at work and the puzzled look on the german soldiers faces when they could not understand this language i am glad that all of the native american code are getting the recognition they deserve
<START> we saw this in a bargain basket at the local <UNK> <UNK> 50 for the dvd reading all the hype <UNK> all over the cover saying how <UNK> it is and it also had a really good established cast we thought this must a great film br br so we bought took it home shoved it in the dvd player sat back and waited for the to begin and waited and waited and waited a bit more br br some 90 minutes later although it felt more like 3 hours the credits rolled and that was the end of that br br what a letdown even paying <UNK> 50 seemed a con god knows what caine richardson and were thinking when they said <UNK> to this <UNK> and as for <UNK> well much as i enjoyed black books shaun of the dead and his comedy <UNK> i felt he was out of his depth in this film he tried too hard playing for laughs probably thinking that if <UNK> the characteristics from his black books character would work here br br sadly it back fired the gags fell flat after awhile and then he became just an <UNK> which is a shame because i believe given the right part he could be a very good film character actor br br anyway to sum up the actors in the actors failed to act br br
<START> for three quarters of an hour the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort although it is <UNK> with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot there is something happening it is not much and it certainly is not obvious the combination of palace impressions and story driving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters in fact they keep them <UNK> as there is no character development at all everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own cliché and role the cute kinda <UNK> girl the fighting the <UNK> aristocrat the male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all he is a shallow presence which actually doesn't even matter as he is only there because the <UNK> required him to it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up when the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening the movie first <UNK> completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous it <UNK> or better <UNK> itself with a by the book <UNK> ex <UNK> more clichés and some of the most crude plot devices and choices i have ever seen it's history alright first the movie's a drama though it's supposed to be comedic and then it turns into a farce the protagonists do what they are expected to do and there are no surprises the first set of somewhat serious <UNK> however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audience br br this movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning since there is none nor for its technical realization the animation and editing is fair and <UNK> the sound mixing but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average japanese productions of the late 1980's in fact the visual treats seem static un inspired and un original br br worst of all it totally fails to entertain even if you don't bother with characters and all that stuff there's too little going on here and the rest is corny at best get a real <UNK> instead have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one
<START> like in les <UNK> du <UNK> two <UNK> lives a love story without <UNK> the film consists out of a lot of interesting conversation and a lot of sweet moments the best one comes in a listening booth they listen to a record together and once in a while they look at each other they talk they like each other she suggests a change in their lives but he is out of hope the realistic over the realistic but <UNK> dialogs a really <UNK> work for this film spanish novel director jesus creates one of the most perfect gallery from the latest year of spanish cinema
<START> i like full house and step by step the same i don't have a favorite episode i just like certain scenes but some scenes i don't like but i <UNK> to say the reason i started watching this show is because it had suzanne <UNK> in it and my most favorite character was dana and karen could be a <UNK> sometimes but she was good character also i just like to watch family shows instead of trash that has a lot of drugs and violence this show is a lot like other family shows where one of the parents are always strict about and dates other than step by step my other favorite shows are full house sabrina the teenage witch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the andy griffith show and dukes of hazzard
<START> i rented this type of soft core before but i can honestly say i wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as rod steele you only live until you die which was both sexy and funny it had a good script a sincere leading man and a sense of purpose it also has <UNK> hall who is hot the reason why i didn't expect this movie was because the box was missing the must be 18 to rent <UNK> i was looking for more cheese and less <UNK> br br first of all i think movies shouldn't be allowed to start with actors <UNK> for a part at a talent agency or wherever actors <UNK> in this movies seeing the actors <UNK> highlights the lack of <UNK> that went into acting out the real characters in the movie br br okay having found out that this was a soft core movie i didn't necessarily turn it off and demand my money back but the <UNK> way the extended video erotic scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay cable release are very annoying and easy to fast forward through without the <UNK> quality of say rod steele you know they must've had some money because i think some of it is filmed overseas br br i will have to say the main actor trying not to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> on himself is one of the most <UNK> acting jobs i've ever seen and i've seen from <UNK> it may actually have been worth the dollar rental <UNK> that and <UNK> hall still there are better corny movies to rent with your friends
<START> this film is on my list of worst movies ever made the story is <UNK> and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions all films need to have an inner logic and this film just doesn't have it the story doesn't make any sense br br to see faye <UNK> christopher plummer and diana quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime faye <UNK> is the lucky one because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film on the other hand donald sutherland must be an amazing actor because he manages to look good in spite of bad directing and bad writing his performance is believable and he manages to stay in character in spite of everything br br if dame agatha christie were alive she would die laughing the movie is that bad
<START> this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made everything about it acting directing script cinematography is dreadful the alien a human in <UNK> suit claims to be from a nearby universe one assumes the scriptwriter meant galaxy but didn't bother to get a <UNK> to check his terms a better title for the film would be it came from the planet of plot <UNK> the plot is <UNK> silly and nearly nonexistent the humans are all given magical that <UNK> to a <UNK> series of unlikely <UNK> just to move the bare plot any thought to the passage of time is ignored now it's a couple days after meeting the alien then <UNK> all of a sudden there's only a couple hours left until zero hour do yourself a favor and miss this movie you will make yourself <UNK> for having watched it the ending is particularly silly and should have been accompanied by someone going <UNK> da as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you'll get cancer watching it if you can watch the last 10 minutes without <UNK> yourself enemies of freedom honestly laughing you're retarded
<START> why is it that instant <UNK> aren't instant this was the <UNK> problem i placed in the lap of the one <UNK> angry he <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> weren't his bag equally i <UNK> what bag he looked further <UNK> br br some of you will be wondering why has the only one lower <UNK> br br the who we shall call 5 for data protection reasons injured his toe how i hear you ask i will proceed as we have <UNK> from the review of <UNK> punch 2002 irene via sly <UNK> and dirty <UNK> etc tried in vain to teach the slight <UNK> of to all the angry 5 who is known only for his violent <UNK> against <UNK> principals during the post revolutionary years of the now united states of america and it's <UNK> affect on the mind sets of it's population in the post modern empire that now exists through the <UNK> of countries smaller than it got carried away in a river of violence due to his lack of <UNK> of according to an eye witness he <UNK> around like a <UNK> <UNK> string at <UNK> <UNK> wielding a stick with nail through it after the struggle that <UNK> 5 were each found to be missing their left <UNK> 3 were discovered <UNK> beneath a bush and 5 had the nail stuck in his big toe br br a lifestyle is as modest as a nuns with only <UNK> health care <UNK> at <UNK> above sea level when the first aid <UNK> was opened only an for a tin of <UNK> and some <UNK> were found 5 <UNK> around like a dark on a <UNK> in agony until irene burst forth like a <UNK> from a <UNK> house and suggested <UNK> his <UNK> in <UNK> spit 5 agreed to the <UNK> to <UNK> him a bottle of 100 <UNK> old was produced some say it was left by an angry <UNK> who is thought to be an <UNK> of the angry one under the influence the toe was <UNK> until dressed with slightly <UNK> and some blue <UNK> some of you may feel that this <UNK> wouldn't do the any good and you would be fully <UNK> for holding that view only four days later <UNK> set it and a week later the leg was removed through the use of even <UNK> <UNK> bands
<START> the cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music filmmakers were daring to make avant garde films discussing taboo subjects only <UNK> before in exploitation films starting with both breathless and underground american cinema such as kenneth anger films became more and more experimental all of this <UNK> when hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with easy rider one of the best and most surprising <UNK> of this era was also one of the least successful initially head was made when the <UNK> career was seriously <UNK> which is what damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made br br the plot well there really isn't one as many have said it involves the <UNK> going from one surreal scenario to the next one however these sequences are all obviously <UNK> <UNK> and basically mock how the <UNK> were sick of being confined to their light pre <UNK> reputation its a shame that the film found no audience the <UNK> <UNK> who loved them had moved onto a new <UNK> as they always do the psychedelic <UNK> crowd to whom the film was garnered would never be caught dead at a <UNK> movie its all their loss this film may be plot less but it is certainly not without meaning and is very intelligently put together the crew later made both easy rider and five easy pieces the film was later <UNK> at a 1973 <UNK> and it gained a very positive response which granted it the cult following it had deserved for a long time ironically the <UNK> would fall victim to the same <UNK> they <UNK> in this film with their later 80s reunion 10 10
<START> following the release of white and the seven <UNK> <UNK> ' walt disney productions has continued to produce quality animated feature length children's film many of which i still haven't had the pleasure of seeing 'the <UNK> 1970 ' directed by <UNK> was the <UNK> film in disney's official <UNK> and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of <UNK> cats living in paris france in <UNK> in the mansion of the elderly <UNK> <UNK> voiced by <UNK> <UNK> her loving <UNK> pets  including <UNK> eva <UNK> and her three young <UNK>  are the most important residents when the bumbling butler edgar <UNK> <UNK> learns that the cats stand to <UNK> the old <UNK> entire fortune he sets about <UNK> of the pets <UNK> them in the countryside far from the big city lost and confused <UNK> and her children strike up an <UNK> with a sweet talking alley cat thomas phil harris who agrees to show them the way home br br animation wise 'the isn't anything particularly notable with much earlier disney films such as and 1940 ' <UNK> a similar or even superior visual style however the story is interesting and exciting  particularly for younger audiences i'll <UNK>  and the musical numbers which i wish were more numerous are terrific for the sake of trivia i'll name my two favourite songs as thomas cat and wants to be a cat the latter of which is a psychedelic <UNK> to the late 60s with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colours led by a trendy <UNK> called the <UNK> cat <UNK> <UNK> the family's journey back to paris is <UNK> and adventurous and we meet such friendly characters as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> two <UNK> <UNK> uncle <UNK> the <UNK> drunken relative georges <UNK> ancient but <UNK> lawyer and <UNK> and <UNK> two dim witted <UNK> dogs with a <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is not just good its amazing besides providing us with good performances original plot fantastic special effects thoughtful messages and a lot more it was an until then completely unseen world to the public this is the first sci fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind <UNK> reality that the audience is left without words i am only 16 years old and therefore i was raised into a world of modern effects and 3d animations in the movies but nonetheless i was really and i mean completely blown away by the quality of these effects even after almost 40 years the visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie the camera was in true kubrick style amazing and enchanting it feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world especially in the round control room or whatever you call it the effects the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though i had seen the rating before i bought it but this movie has more to it than this the meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself even though i think there are some clear points concerning humanity also true kubrick style how humanity on top of its evolution is just <UNK> on board and therefore not needed by the computer one of <UNK> tools how we in space appear like babies learning to walk once more losing control of our tools in zero gravity breathing through equipment as fish out of water on the peak of evolution we set out into the never ending adventure as simple <UNK> many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is boring <UNK> or just a waste of time but before you can jump to those conclusions think about why kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes this is to illustrate the beauty of it beauty beauty is in many cases not granted the <UNK> respect by viewers kubrick wants to show us beauty and if we do not <UNK> to it and relax we can not enjoy this film as it was intended this is not an ordinary movie we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies this requires time thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch all of this together makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures 10 10 let me know if you agree with me
<START> goes to town was the second and last full length animated feature made by max and dave <UNK> who created a parallel universe to disney while disney's films are well remembered today both of the <UNK> films <UNK> travels and this one are forgotten br br is a <UNK> original not an adaptation like the first picture that is a major plus one would think no the critics rarely on the sides to begin with <UNK> into them for this yes the story is not as tight as <UNK> but how can you hate a film that <UNK> itself so <UNK> br br it is filled with great musical numbers and a very involving story which would be a crime to reveal the characters are lovable and charming and there is heart in this film br br the really <UNK> themselves here and never quite did so again most of their time would be devoted to one <UNK> after this <UNK> at the box office it's a shame they didn't continue making features who knows their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they were aiming for br br out of 4 stars
<START> alexander <UNK> marked director <UNK> <UNK> return to film making after a period of <UNK> and what he produced is a bald faced propaganda film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over germany br br there's very little plot russians <UNK> to battle germans russia wins the film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes mixed in with some moments of german brutality like a rather shocking scene that shows german soldiers throwing russian children onto a raging fire this was <UNK> first sound film and it's clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium indeed this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added there are some dialogue scenes but they sit rather <UNK> on the screen and the pacing is all off as if the actors weren't actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them <UNK> mostly uses sound as an excuse to <UNK> a rousing score over the proceedings and indeed that's one of the film's biggest <UNK> br br say what you will about <UNK> ability or lack of to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect and alexander <UNK> over all shines through its <UNK> br br grade a
<START> i felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined imdb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while br br the acting direction other areas of the movie are fantastic i love brad pitt with george clooney it works the witty banter was still there too from the first movie my question is how in the world did they let this script out of the <UNK> process i thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk but that twist can i call it that was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a <UNK> from the ticket booth i have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life here i was expecting something similar to the first movie good chemistry good acting good direction amazing plot only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it br br the part that gets me still is that this movie has now <UNK> more than <UNK> million dollars br br in summary i felt that this movie insulted my intelligence i still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with julia roberts acting like julia roberts this movie made me sad and angry
<START> i thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series after all part 3 didn't measure up to part 2 and this one doesn't have daniel <UNK> humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3 but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching br br the girl's part was pretty good she's a lost teenager who needs direction i find the plot a little hard to believe that the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of mr <UNK> a man she just met of course he was a friend of her brother br br i did appreciate the monastery one might think from some of my other reviews that i wouldn't have liked the dancing monks but i thought it was amusing it showed that they know how to have some fun now if these were monks in ancient china dancing to pop music that would have been another matter br br probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug <UNK> told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid nations trying to destroy each other is stupid but having respect for all life is not stupid <UNK> has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well br br i give this movie a 4 out of 10 sure there were some things i liked about it it wasn't as funny as part three and no character could ever live up to <UNK> in part 2 this movie has no re watch value i can't imagine watching it again but it is worth seeing once
<START> ugh bad bad bad but i have seen worse which is why i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 just got finished watching this movie and i thought it was about as rotten as the flesh on dr face the worst line of the movie had to be i like to introduce you to someone meet my inner b <UNK> which consisted of the lone survivor of the fantastic 5 group throwing a trash can at dr <UNK> and then falling on the stage second worst line i'm the park ranger that's gonna f <UNK> you up what this freak ain't even a cop did anyone else notice how everyone instantly dies from the magic gut stab no one dies that quick from a gut stab i know this cause i see them frequently in the operating room except super park ranger dude had like a bucket of blood poor out of that wound <UNK> around on the floor some and then comes in for the finale to take a <UNK> shot at dr <UNK> while inner b <UNK> lies <UNK> on the floor and if that don't beat all he doesn't even have the decency to die then like everyone else inner b <UNK> helps him limp outside and proceeds to tell him not to die while she runs for help cause he's like her only friend left alive now since when did these two become friends i don't think a frantic meeting in the woods where he tells you to head for the city qualifies as getting to know you time but whatever br br only watch this movie if there's nothing else own and you have nothing else to do with your time
<START> sorry to disagree with you but i found the series to be quite engaging so much so that i invested in the system and my own copies of the games this is mind you almost ten years after the initial release of 1 the graphics were ground breaking for their time the first graphics games for home systems the music and characters are all memorable and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment true the second game was better than the first and the third was perhaps lacking the of the second installment but all three offered different play and i enjoy them to this day by the way i'm old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever and <UNK> were black and white
<START> i've watched many short films in my day often i find them either too <UNK> throwing too much information at the viewer in the short amount of time they have to run too artsy or lacking a clear cut vision i can say none of these things about in this review i'll do my best to avoid any dramatic spoilers but i'll also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is <UNK> incest br br as with any short film the story is fairly simple straightforward and easy to <UNK> it's clear that the film attempts to shine a light one one of modern <UNK> most deeply held <UNK> this film succeeds in every respect in the fifteen minutes of running time i found myself feeling a gamut of emotions with only a little dialog the viewer is rapidly pulled into the most personal moments and thoughts of these star crossed brothers br br from the opening scene set in their early childhood one can see the very close relationship the brothers have when the film progresses to the present day in the next scene the excellent acting and honest heartfelt performances remind the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and harsh way as the relationship progresses any disgust the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer suddenly realizes that there can be only one possible resolution and the aftermath of that resolution is heart <UNK> br br anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this film and <UNK> its message if nothing else it <UNK> and honestly challenges the viewer to some of our deepest beliefs on the shame filled and <UNK> taboo of incest though the film is only fifteen minutes long it <UNK> in the viewer long after the credits roll this is perhaps my favorite short film i've ever seen i can't recommend it highly enough
<START> i love this movie i watched it over and over when i rented it from netflix it had a lot of substance and meaning for me i think many people will enjoy it i have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and am happy to say they are getting better and better in how they are presented they tend to have a more positive feel for the life style and <UNK> of gay women its nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this society i think it is apparent that more and more movies with this theme will grace our theaters and tv screens many producers and directors are realizing that lesbians live very full and wholesome lives and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals as well as families without <UNK>
<START> this movie tells the story of nine ambitious teens trying to follow their dream at the infamous new york high school for performing arts <UNK> the singer bruno the modern <UNK> lisa <UNK> and <UNK> the struggling dancers ralph the comedian and doris and <UNK> the actors while they all think they have what it takes to really reach their goals they are going to need a lot more than just their talent they will have to deal with <UNK> <UNK> education pain and love in order to achieve their fame br br fame is one of the most entertaining classic and inspirational movies of all time it has everything a teen drama musical should have extremely catchy entertaining oscar winning songs performed by the amazing irene <UNK> stunning dance numbers a very attractive cast that makes you believe in the characters and a great story including the heartbreaking scene when <UNK> meets the video camera br br like i said the cast is awesome irene <UNK> can really act and it's not only her singing that makes her shine here as <UNK> lee is very good as bruno barry miller brings a lot of humor to ralph maureen is great as the <UNK> doris and look closely and you'll see paul of er as <UNK> br br this is truly an amazing film fame really touched me and inspired me to keep following my dreams as an actor and singer any movie that moves me this much is a winner in my book a must see the film really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer
<START> julie andrews and rock hudson were great in this movie musical the opening song by ms andrews <UNK> away the dark will always be in the back roads of my mind the plot line during world war i is great and suspenseful one if you are a romantic you will love this movie this is a movie that i always enjoy to see again and again
<START> from the creators of bruce almighty and liar liar the film took a while to pick up from the start at least for me seeing as i expected this was a run along america pie flick but it was slightly different a fun loving <UNK> who finishes high school and makes his own college running it <UNK> as you can expect there's a lot of parties and hot girls in <UNK> but this film tried harder than your average teen flick <UNK> <UNK> justin long encourages his students peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately it to the system ' the humour was varied which i loved all the cast delivered fantastic performances hire this one out with a friend it's a bloody crack up
<START> this is a movie about a man everybody thinks is jewish this is a movie about lawrence newman who lives in brooklyn in the 1940's at the time of wwii one day when he gets himself glasses people start thinking he's a jew and that only because he looks like one and he lives in a very <UNK> neighborhood so some people start treating him like dirt they make that judgment being a jew of <UNK> fresh wife <UNK> hart too that makes their lives unbearable <UNK> focus 2001 is a fairly good look at the that's a problem that won't go away the movie is based on <UNK> novel which i admit i haven't read but the movie is really good so i'm sure the book would also the actors do good job william h macy is always good and his work as larry newman is brilliant laura dern is <UNK> hart and she's magnificent meat <UNK> is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep jews out by any means necessary david character as the jewish shop owner mr is the most sympathetic in the movie <UNK> is the perfect choice for the role one of the greatest scenes is in the end when mr and newman fight against those nazi like people with baseball bats they join together to fight the evil the christian and the jew
<START> should i have expected anything other than <UNK> from <UNK> top this was on of the worst movies i have ever seen it is by far the worst comedy i have ever seen <UNK> of the board did not add humor to my attitude rather it <UNK> me that's right <UNK> top is such a bad comedian that i became <UNK> that this man is making movies
<START> compared to this <UNK> is a speed freak br br compared to this bela <UNK> is mtv br br compared to this the movie russian <UNK> is a roller coaster ride br br i've just described 3 of the experiences i've ever known and this one tops them all but that's not saying it's bad on the contrary i really liked it but it was a chore br br i won't describe the plot because you can easily find that elsewhere suffice it to say that the plot is insane it's one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since becoming john <UNK> i believe the interesting plot is the main reason i kept from <UNK> off also the humour was nice that's something we rarely see in slow artsy films br br here we see a bizarre <UNK> of the norm most movies have little plot little substance yet they fill 90 mins with a lot of images to keep us enthralled but the hole has 100 plot theme without much to please the eyes in that respect i suppose it's a truly intellectual experience much like reading a painfully <UNK> novel like vanity fair which i've never been able to finish br br if you have a tremendous attention span i think you'll really like this film despite its pace it's highly creative and imaginative it's like jean pierre <UNK> on <UNK> and with a drab dusty camera lens best of luck
<START> until today i thought there only three people including me who considered <UNK> gate 1980 to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western since the 1970 after little big man 1970 johnson 1972 the outlaw <UNK> 1976 and the long riders 1980 br br i was stunned and pleased to see that 22 5 of those voting at imdb rate this movie a 10 as do i a recent book the worst movies of all time includes <UNK> gate through it's production and release it was <UNK> as no movie since <UNK> almost twenty years before at one time it was considered the most expensive over budget movie of all time <UNK> even <UNK> it was blamed for the downfall of its studio united artists until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling michael <UNK> fresh from his glory with the deer hunter was hated and <UNK> for his success and movie making excess but clearly that was petty jealousy at its worst br br <UNK> ended up <UNK> one of the great <UNK> of the american experience this film is not to be missed but any serious student of american filmmaking
<START> i loved this movie the first time i saw it it gives such detail of what executives involved in the news industry will do just to get a story on the air notably jane craig <UNK> kenny to finish editing the piece to get it off and then joan cusack struggling to get it in and william hurt who according to jane commits an incredible <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> his tears during his date rape interview a flaw that is pointed out by aaron another high point is when tom uses jane for his own benefits and then turns around and sleeps with jennifer the script is brilliant and the directing is almost as good all three main actors were great in the portrayals of their characters especially holly hunter and albert brooks whom is the funniest in the film william hurt is also very good this deserved at least three oscars best actress holly hunter best supporting actor albert brooks and best picture i liked the last parts of the film where it shows them <UNK> 7 years later br br 8 10
<START> back in 1995 barry directed a movie that ended up on many critics best of lists by the time the year's were being <UNK> in entertainment <UNK> the movie was get <UNK> and it gave lead star john travolta his second big hit in as many years after pulp fiction put him back in front of the <UNK> based on a novel by <UNK> leonard the film focused on wise guy <UNK> <UNK> travolta and his attempts to break into the movie business i for one was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp dialogue of the original so much so that when i heard there was going to be a sequel i seemed to <UNK> my usual <UNK> that occurs when a studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later the sequel also based on a novel by leonard is this time directed by f gary gray who's italian job in 2003 was one of the years highest <UNK> films couple that with the cast now <UNK> to include uma thurman harvey keitel cedric the entertainer the rock vince vaughn and james woods and you have all the <UNK> of a great <UNK> in the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990's this time round we pick up as <UNK> travolta is leaving the movie business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for <UNK> in the making of a sequel to his successful first film thanks in small part to his friend tommy <UNK> woods and the misfortune of his death <UNK> decides to look into the <UNK> and dangerous music industry this first leads to the famous <UNK> club where <UNK> meets singing sensation linda moon christina who as lead of an <UNK> trio can belt out tunes like <UNK> <UNK> that is the <UNK> before bobby brown started bringing home the small <UNK> of sugar linda is under contract with vaughn who with his overly apparent gay bodyguard elliot <UNK> the rock plan to ensure linda <UNK> the final five years of her contract even if that means putting <UNK> on ice so with <UNK> future in the balance <UNK> weaves an interesting web which will include a record producer thurman a <UNK> sound <UNK> cedric the russian mob the police lead singer steven tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing woo that sounds exciting so why wasn't it be cool tries too hard to well be cool but the result is a film that unlike the original has no heart and no soul be cool feels instead like it was directed by a saturday night live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that don't string together over a whole movie take for example the scene where travolta and thurman dance together for the first time since pulp fiction as black eyed <UNK> performs live in the background the scene is forced and should have ended up on the cutting room floor instead it is coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the story <UNK> with any real thrust the concert and the <UNK> trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual moments that don't amount to much of a movie when put together but those aren't the only issues with the sequel which could probably be <UNK> product placement with the amount of 2 ways and <UNK> that seem to stare at you more intensely than serious look the story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing whether it is the <UNK> <UNK> or the gay muscle guy that has a movie poster of <UNK> <UNK> on the wall no characters is above offering us anything we haven't seen many times before and in much better films with the magic all but gone from the first film we end up with an inferior product that is the second film in the past six months <UNK> 13 being the other that <UNK> a bunch of stars onto a <UNK> only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open audition be cool was a major disappointment i so wanted it to be the get <UNK> of the new millennium and i ended up with a film where the <UNK> must have been a gas but experience left me with a stinker
<START> it's the br br wow what a skin <UNK> bad movie honestly this is one of my favorite episodes of mst3k just some things to point out br br 1 the incestuous lesbian mother daughter exchange was weird i do need <UNK> now br br 2 there is no god there is just dude i love that quote from crow br br 3 whatever did happen to the nuns that took the bus home will we ever know i have a horrible <UNK> in my stomach br br 4 lastly don't watch this movie un it has joe <UNK> as the main star <UNK> br br 1 10 for un 8 10 for
<START> committed as in heather graham being committed to saving her husband marriage and then being committed to a psychiatric ward in failure to do so what a clever clever use of words br br one of those meaningless wanna be philosophical films in which narration is a series of oh so wise observations that verge on poetry 90s club poetry better known as <UNK> poetry oh it's so je <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> written directed or by a woman lisa krueger whoever the hell you are this is a pointless <UNK> directed road movie full of new age nonsense and characters that are meant to be interesting but are merely seen before or just plain dull the <UNK> in this movie as part of the poor urban minority are typically <UNK> in all their <UNK> obsessed as a <UNK> superior people which is the highlight of this film's political correctness br br the whole affair is lifeless and <UNK> to be so only when occasional good cast members appear kay place baker wilson on the other hand we have <UNK> affleck who is one of the very best examples of why <UNK> is on par with first degree murder as a crime i have rarely seen a more <UNK> actor a skinny ugly moron who goes through his lines in a sleepy manner almost as if he were <UNK> them in a half awake quasi dream plus that weak voice one of the weakest male voices i've heard in my life he must have gone to the <UNK> maguire <UNK> school of acting to cast this idiot in anything speaks volumes about any movie i e about any director or producer hence lisa krueger is a talentless waste of space we've also got that moron who had the lead role in the mst3k <UNK> werewolf i think his name is <UNK> but i'm not sure check out his ridiculous accent and the dumb speech
<START> soon after this movie was released salman khan was handed over a 6 year <UNK> read further to know why am i mentioning this br br and i <UNK> a sigh of relief not that i was happy that he got jail for something which because he was a <UNK> but i was happy <UNK> this meant no more salman khan movies no more his <UNK> and no more over hyped acting read overacting br br this movie made no sense whatsoever br br the scene where the kid <UNK> to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice <UNK> according to the movie script it would chase anyone but ultimately it finds only salman khan bare <UNK> well this is what happened br br the <UNK> gets <UNK> in another foolish way and you have to have an iq of <UNK> to believe that then it chases salman khan who was on his water <UNK> and the chase continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show to foolish audience in my regard all those people who have given this movie 5 and above unless they are paid to do that br br another of breath taking unbelievable scene was at the end when all the <UNK> about the marriage is made and salman khan with govinda in disguise comes and <UNK> the marriage by another of those highly <UNK> songs later on even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and <UNK> <UNK> to father and <UNK> everything is fine and govinda marries br br this made me wonder if convincing was so easy why did not they do that and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money br br this movie is must avoid and don't even think it had any scene worth watching the plot is way too <UNK> with characters popping from no where and ultimately <UNK> for ex don what a waste of characters br br after this movie i took a <UNK> that i would not watch salman khan movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an <UNK> <UNK> which means i would never watch
<START> directed by jim <UNK> <UNK> mall return of the swamp thing <UNK> massacre is the fourth installment in the <UNK> party massacre series just think about it it's the fourth chapter of a slasher series that no one really cares about so how could this even be good well it's not but since when did slasher films have to be good <UNK> massacre is entertaining that's for sure but in the entertainment field we've seen better that's for sure too as you can see i'm not sure about where i stand concerning this movie those who watch slashers only for nudity will be more than satisfied this movie's all boobs but unfortunately no blood or not enough i think i'm being generous with this movie because i had a good time watching it and i really enjoy watching slasher movies even as bad as they sometimes are if you want me to be sincere the <UNK> party massacre part 1 is the best one and all the others are a waste of time so i guess i have a lot of time to waste for more fun watch <UNK> camp 2 and <UNK> camp
<START> this movie was awful plain and simple it will probably be <UNK> by those who only see films and not movies and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film but i am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring self <UNK> and painfully drawn out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars br br i was <UNK> into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who <UNK> regular movies perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday br br the storyline is quite a promising one a man is imprisoned for 15 years never knowing his <UNK> nor his crime he is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him however the great concept soon <UNK> into a pathetic joke as oh <UNK> runs around beating people up trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live <UNK> <UNK> presumably for dramatic effect as there is absolutely no other reason for it all the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown his nemesis a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man looks like a banana republic model twenty years younger than him hey i know prison has been hard on oh <UNK> but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age of all the things wrong with this movie this one seems like the <UNK> one to fix br br and the big secret the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when i could have been out doing something <UNK> is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a <UNK> started in high school come on throw us a bone here was that really the best they could do i sat through stupid dialogue over acting gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this by the way i'm not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story but in this case it seems i was forced to watch our hero knock out someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of <UNK> in order to distract me from <UNK> out i was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage br br take my advice do something else with your time and money or take your nine dollars and go see a <UNK> movie one that you might actually enjoy
<START> in these modern times as subject known quite well to the director of the short film that this german count is going to talk politically correct films are the <UNK> of the modern young <UNK> projects shoulder arms directed by <UNK> charlie chaplin during wwi the film was released only a few weeks before the <UNK> is an obvious example of why the early cinema <UNK> were a very bold people certainly to direct a humorous film inspired in the terrible bloody first world war was a complicated matter that only few directors with those dangerous and daring ideas could be allowed to <UNK> to venture upon such delicate enterprise and with success was reserved only to geniuses br br as this german count said shoulder arms was made during wwi that time in where definitely the whole world lost its innocence fortunately not the german fat <UNK> of this and it is a hilarious inventive social satire about that and any war the film it is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story in where that tramp will live though <UNK> and courageous adventures in the front a hero for the or not br br to mock the war <UNK> the the frontal attacks and the germans how you dare by the way there are a lot of inaccuracies in the film  the german soldiers by that time had <UNK> and longer <UNK> not to mention that the <UNK> lacks many <UNK> in his in an elegant funny and delicate way it is even today a film miracle impossible of being <UNK> keeping in mind those terrible wartime circumstances the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent obviously <UNK> charlie chaplin had very much of it br br and now if you'll allow me i must <UNK> take my leave because this german count must go back to the <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> von <UNK> http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> the gay <UNK> is wonderful throughout the banter between leo <UNK> and harold <UNK> is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today best line that would be my third choice diego is obviously the <UNK> for kevin smith's silent bob <UNK> n black and white cinematography particularly with the shadows was striking all i can say about <UNK> <UNK> is thank god for dvd you can go right to the scene where she is trying on and and watch her standing in front of that mirror over and over again br br <UNK> i forget that <UNK> <UNK> guy sings real too
<START> when a loser teen is bitten by an <UNK> he becomes the superhero <UNK> br br superhero movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens sadly however despite the presence of david <UNK> who was involved with airplane top secret and the naked gun movies it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have mainly it's more dumb than fun the fault mainly lies with the gags it's simply not funny enough some of the jokes do work such as the nail gun scene but other parts simply fall flat the x men spoof for example or the whole <UNK> sequence blazing <UNK> this isn't one of the key things about the best spoof movies like airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny the cast for the most part play is completely straight this makes it even funnier even when there is simple dialog in the <UNK> there may well be funny things happening behind the cast again funny the other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts to hang the gags on br br the recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies then try and spoof them as a result the so called plot of these movies very rarely exist another flaw these movies have is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene the cast try to get into the spirit required but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes it's hard to get worked up about it br br as recent spoof movies go it's not as bad as epic movie date movie or the awful meet the <UNK> but considering that some people involved here have made good funny movies in the past it's nowhere near good enough
<START> i love sci fi and am willing to put up with a lot sci fi movies tv are usually <UNK> under appreciated and misunderstood i tried to like this i really did but it is to good tv sci fi as <UNK> 5 is to star trek the original silly <UNK> cheap cardboard sets stilted dialogues cg that doesn't match the background and painfully one dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a <UNK> <UNK> setting i'm sure there are those of you out there who think <UNK> 5 is good sci fi tv it's not it's clichéd and uninspiring while us viewers might like emotion and character development sci fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously <UNK> star trek it may treat important issues yet not as a serious philosophy it's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish just missing a spark of life their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable often painful to watch the makers of earth know it's rubbish as they have to always say gene <UNK> earth otherwise people would not continue watching <UNK> <UNK> must be turning in their <UNK> as this dull cheap poorly edited watching it without <UNK> breaks really brings this home <UNK> of a show <UNK> into space spoiler so kill off a main character and then bring him back as another actor dallas all over again
<START> oz was a fantastic show as long as frequent male nudity doesn't turn you off there was way too much frontal male nudity in this show more than any other show you'd see on a porn channel minus that it was the best show on tv and a previous <UNK> said better than prime suspect prime suspect is tom and jerry vs the simpsons no contest if you have <UNK> they are now re running it from the start on channel 101 they're at episode 3 now highly recommended the creator tom <UNK> also did homicide which was an awesome show but why all the male nudity we all know that stuff happens in prison but did they really need to show it as often that was the only thing that turned me off the show if i want to see naked men guys getting raped i'll kill someone myself and witness first hand otherwise i like my tv shows free of black <UNK> every five minutes
<START> this movie although well shot and superbly acted was awful i felt as if i was watching a car accident sure i kept watching but i really wanted to turn my head the plot leaves little to be desired was extremely disjointed and the ending was abysmal although it did fit the tone of the movie i was hoping for something to improve this movie i still don't understand what the references to <UNK> and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much it's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful awful story there's not much more to say about this movie save yourself the time and watch c span it'll be more uplifting
<START> i guess i was prepared after all the years of hearing about it first heard about it from <UNK> and ebert when they said divine ate <UNK> i had to look it up then a friend told me about it in 1991 she said also that her parents saw it when it first came out and that her mom almost dumped her dad over it so by the time i caught pink <UNK> on sundance today i was prepared for the most part br br i still couldn't help but be surprised by the <UNK> close ups and the <UNK> scene that said the only characters i <UNK> with were edie and the egg man her crying scene early in the film though over something <UNK> to normal people actually makes me sad though she sure wasn't pretty she had a cute voice i was happy for her and the egg man and they actually touched me br br on the other hand the acting in this poverty level production was not good and as for the script just how does john waters come up with this stuff well at least it's different
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> face of a <UNK> community from various angles slowly taking its time through the beginning as it should until we emerge from <UNK> but banal hopes and expectations into <UNK> of dreams and a heart stopping revelation about the terrible <UNK> of <UNK> br br <UNK> pans and <UNK> across the snowy <UNK> comfort the mind and <UNK> the viewer this restless camera work is <UNK> in a <UNK> character who is equally the drifter <UNK> his job at the coal mine and leaving his family to cut <UNK> then <UNK> again and returning to the stark humanity of his boy dead br br a <UNK> old woman <UNK> on her husband and a young boy dies old things become new and new things die throughout is the snowy <UNK> as wonder stricken as the history of cinema
<START> there have been many documentaries that i have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence the thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind first and foremost but this is the first film that had me <UNK> with anger after i saw it it seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at <UNK> was at the very least an <UNK> and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and <UNK> and at the very worst an act of murder like most people when the siege at <UNK> was occurring i assumed that david was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult after seeing this i think that was more likely a slightly <UNK> and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the u s government through his eccentric actions sure there were lots of weapons at the branch compound but none of it was illegal it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless and it was <UNK> to see the <UNK> <UNK> of the men in charge of the government forces on the <UNK> site the clueless <UNK> of janet reno and the <UNK> defense of the attack on <UNK> a defense led by a few of the <UNK> <UNK> standing out most in my mind was ny representative and current u s senator from ny charles i voted for the man when i lived in ny state i'm a <UNK> pretty left <UNK> too after seeing his actions on this <UNK> i wish i could go back in time and vote for <UNK> instead for anyone remotely interested in the government this is a very crucial film a must see i even think this should be shown in classes it's that important
<START> the love letter is one of my all time favorite books so naturally i was skeptical when i heard it was to become a movie but i liked it i found myself <UNK> through the entire movie i admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half i thought that <UNK> and scott were perfect as helen and johnny just as i <UNK> them and the town and scenery were just right as well i recommend this film but don't expect too much just enjoy it

<START> john cusack stars as <UNK> in this silly little movie that has to be one of the best of the eighties teen comedies believe it or not <UNK> moore is his co star if you love the eighties grew up around that time or are an angst ridden teenage artist get ready to laugh wait until you see the cartoons what a riot
<START> story of the creation of underdog and adventures battling simon bar sinister in a live action format first we have picked up off the street and brought to a science experiment lab where simon bar sinister works he fights back when sinister tries to <UNK> him with a chemical and accident occurs he gets <UNK> and the lab blows up <UNK> sinister on the street runs <UNK> of riff <UNK> another dog and gets picked up by jim belushi who was a guard at the lab <UNK> son discovers that has all these powers and eventually becomes underdog who will once again battle sinister br br once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not for me the film half works and half doesn't the part that doesn't is all of the stuff where you see the dog as a dog with his master some of the <UNK> is funny but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to sweet polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film its painfully dull and feels like it takes forever to get through it which considering the film is say 75 minutes sans credits is something you don't want to do br br the parts that are good are anything with simon bar sinister peter is a blast and anything where underdog goes into action some how somewhere they managed to find a way to be both true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it of course i could be wrong since the middle section is so dull but i think not since i do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable br br as a whole its probably as awful as some people have said but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts this is an okay cartoon to film adaption but wait for cable really
<START> <UNK> tales is basically made up of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert the film begins with the classic hook story and then we're introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert they crash their car put out some <UNK> and start a fire in a little abandoned <UNK> waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire to pass the time they decide to start telling classic horror stories about <UNK> <UNK> a girl who falls prey to an internet predator and a <UNK> who takes <UNK> in a haunted house as they tell the eerie tales each story becomes increasingly terrifying but the real shock that <UNK> them is yet to come br br in my opinion the last story they tell is probably the scariest and had some genuine frightening effects the first story was alright and the sequence near the end was a little creepy the second story built a lot of suspense more than either of the others did but it's unoriginal plot was it's downfall i remember watching this movie a long time ago when i was like eight years old on hbo and the third story scared the crap out of me although it's not scary to me now you'll probably recognize some of the cast here particularly amy smart from the opening hook <UNK> story and christine taylor as one of the main actresses in the film the twist ending was kinda interesting too i know i didn't see that coming i thought it was all cleverly <UNK> together br br to sum things up if you're looking for a horror movie that is worth the while rent this you should be happy it's a great anthology of some classic urban legends and the whole film was tied together neatly it is much better than what one would expect 7 10
<START> super troopers was an instant classic club dread while disappointing to many had its moments <UNK> has fewer moments i saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the broken lizard group who made super troopers so naturally i picked it up i only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny a far cry from super troopers all in all i was very disappointed i would not recommend this to anyone unless you have an abundance of free time and really need to kill some time however you're better off playing video games or watching something that might make you laugh or think

<START> radio was a very good movie and honestly i never cry in movies but it had me pretty close to tears it really got to me when <UNK> mom died and he just wouldn't get out of his room i felt really sad about how if you were mentally retarded you wouldn't really be able to understand death i really liked the movie and it's a must see
<START> detective dave is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to new orleans mobster julie but during his investigation is led into a series of surreal encounters with a <UNK> of <UNK> soldiers what a awful plot and it was <UNK> than i had expected it was real slow and had minimal skill in the acting i could not watch through it it was waste of my time another flop i would give it under 1 if i could please people don't waste your time its 1 of <UNK> full time actor sykes and his girlfriend driving under the influence as dave takes to the station the actor tells dave he found some <UNK> remains while on the set of a movie he is filming
<START> it's particularly hard for a director to capture film making without getting precious <UNK> over dramatic or all three <UNK> demonstrates the <UNK> lizard brain methods of a female auteur in <UNK> from two cattle as hitchcock called actors a love scene of <UNK> <UNK> her main battle is with her leading man an actor is really a woman she <UNK> although naturally it is the leading lady who will steal the show i disagree that this is first comedy <UNK> was at various points hilarious but i accept that the french sense of humour can be <UNK> for <UNK> indeed dozens of imdb reviewers <UNK> no comedy in romance by contrast sex is comedy raises plenty of laughs mainly by using an actor's prop that goes back thousands of years to and the ancient <UNK> we wondered leaving the theatre whether beard was a wig a lovely performance from anne as wrestling with her own script looking ten years younger than her age
<START> the man who knew too much 1956 is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in 1934 with the same name in my opinion his later effort is far superior many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn't have the spine <UNK> suspense of the original with peter lorre in both films the plot is essentially the same except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in it tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day <UNK> with their young son and meeting a suspicious man that is very curious about their past it just so happens he's an agent that's looking for a couple involved in a plot to <UNK> a world leader then he gets stabbed in a market because of it being found out that he's a spy and proceeds to fall into stewart's arms dying he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot stewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son the film contains excellent performances by stewart and day in a straight dramatic role as worried and frightened parents this film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as <UNK> musicals the direction by alfred hitchcock is top notch the film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute the scene in albert hall is a classic the original is so slow paced and drab i don't know how people can compare the two just watch the remake and you'll enjoy it i give the movie a 9 out of 10
<START> i've been a devoted imdb visitor for a few years this is the movie that finally compelled me to write in a review br br i caught this movie by chance the opening credits happened to be <UNK> past when i turned my tv on one morning i thoroughly enjoyed the film for many reasons all of which have been well covered by other reviewers the <UNK> the forgotten history of the czech pilots the subtle charm of the supporting characters the <UNK> of the main characters and the first person view during the battle scenes br br but the element of dark blue world that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects especially during combat and this is a good thing while the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them no manipulative shots of worried <UNK> girlfriends were <UNK> every little <UNK> <UNK> did not <UNK> trite patriotic cheers and viewers weren't asked to swallow unbelievable james bond <UNK> pilot <UNK> instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay <UNK> during combat as <UNK> are shot down we are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the typical but audience pleasing revenge based <UNK> instead the other pilots sadly and quietly observe their fellow <UNK> fate in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and <UNK> at that very moment we only briefly experience the <UNK> breathing and the background <UNK> of the <UNK> as we the audience witness a friend spiral quietly down to his death and then immediately need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival br br too often in hollywood we're <UNK> fed the emotions we're supposed to feel and no room is left for the viewer's imagination dark blue world maintains a that <UNK> and involves the viewer allowing us to <UNK> in the movie and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings br br excellent film well worth seeing
<START> now the sci fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films house of the dead 2 all souls day etc but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor writer and now director bruce campbell you get one of the best damn made for tv independent horror films ever made i normally hate these movies in my previous review house of the dead 2 i could not believe how horrible the film was but somehow i took a liking for this film a very good liking for this film the violence is good and so is the black comedy in the film and i recommend you get it a true bruce campbell masterpiece well since there is only a few more lines left i can say whatever i want about this movie
<START> this is a great movie when two people from different backgrounds and social status think that they have nothing to offer each other and in the end they what each other needs it a testament to what the heart knows sometimes we wonder why one man is with a woman or <UNK> versa and the <UNK> appearances say one thing to our eye but what they offer each other from within that we cannot see is amazing and <UNK> when thought that matthew had nothing to offer her and when matthew was only looking for a <UNK> because he had an open marriage w his wife jenny in the end they realized that they could not and did not want to exist without the other it was worth it to them to resist what family and friends thought and what society said was right to be with each other this movie kind of <UNK> my faith in love
<START> i caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and i haven't laughed that hard in a long time this movie was so funny i went out and bought the very next day i love this type of comedy it just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here i was <UNK> i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title seeing other people the title caused me to give it a shot and i'm glad i did i laughed so hard that it hurt now it's part of my collection i definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smart ass type of comedy i will be watching this one over and over
<START> this mystery psychological thriller is i think one of the best i've ever seen all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer <UNK> as jamie harris who changes from the nervous <UNK> in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard you won't forget this movie
<START> i <UNK> on here right after watching this movie feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining but all you <UNK> appear to kind of like it and so since i want the job done right br br from the opening shot the movie <UNK> its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing an entirely <UNK> picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long long time then it goes to some slow motion <UNK> which is at least a little bit cool but then <UNK> that <UNK> of excitement by the most <UNK> soundtrack song i've ever heard some girl <UNK> in <UNK> french over what sounds like sheets of <UNK> <UNK> together whoever decided that needed to be there has never ridden a <UNK> i guarantee it it seemed to be there to test the limits of the audience's patience br br from there the movie is about 50 per <UNK> slow motion you know what's worse than a gratuitous slow motion shot a gratuitous slow motion shot of nothing happening here's a guy walking along a path here's a guy sitting here's a guy looking around here's a guy looking at another guy after a while i started watching the movie at double speed bringing it back down whenever people appeared on screen engaging in actual dialog which was rare once astonishingly i <UNK> the movie to find out what a girl was saying only to find that the camera was showing her talking but the sound was another horrible horrible song and her actual voice was not <UNK> br br this reminds me of some great advice i heard once about writing if you don't have anything to say don't use fancy tricks to pretend as though you do get back to work and think of something to say all these camera tricks like the slow motion and weird lighting and <UNK> and freaky music is what the absence of content looks and sounds like a lot of people have apparently bought it and perceive emotional gravity and deep meaning but i think they are <UNK> this onto a movie that did not do any of the work involved in creating it
<START> a very different jerry lewis film not like all those more famous films that everybody knows lewis deals with the difficult task of <UNK> ii and national <UNK> in germany in a rather unconventional way but even more interesting and important he does it in a very un american way and as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry un american means more sophisticated more subtle more intelligent or simply better that is the reason why the film was no success in the us but a very great success in europe br br all in all jerry lewis has <UNK> by this movie that he is able to do much more than simple slapstick comedy
<START> i just saw this at and i absolutely loved it there were parts where i laughed so hard i couldn't catch my breath the script and direction by glenn are fantastic i can't wait to see more from this talented young man the performances make the movie larry <UNK> and dominic <UNK> are just delightful as the willy and his apprentice arthur ron <UNK> turns in a fantastic performance as usual as a less than sympathetic <UNK> priest bonus <UNK> <UNK> as an <UNK> doctor as always he <UNK> menace and humor perfectly br br this is a style of horror comedy that really hasn't been seen since vincent price did comedy of <UNK> the <UNK> and theater of blood the movie is genuinely scary in places then it'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode keeping you totally off balance some parts are scary and funny at the same time br br i can only afford to see three movies at this year but even if the other two are awful i sell the dead was worth the price of all three i'm going to be looking for more movies from larry <UNK> glass eye <UNK> he's giving the horror genre a much needed kick in the butt
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is an excellent actor he <UNK> at 28 playing a 50 <UNK> old in br br now he turns director with br br the film has a good plot but it's <UNK> br br the theme has been done to death and <UNK> character looks too put on while anil and <UNK> tara tracks are too sudden and then forgotten br br the film moves a <UNK> pace and begins to drag but there are several good scenes like the entire conflict between anil <UNK> and <UNK> where <UNK> says to sell the house br br <UNK> getting caught for a crime and anil shouting at him br br the climax is too much though br br <UNK> shows potential but has some way to go music is okay br br anil kapoor excels in his part like always <UNK> tries hard and is okay but needs to improve <UNK> is excellent this was a turning <UNK> people realized he can act <UNK> is okay and tara are wasted <UNK> is good
<START> boy next door is a hilarious romp through male <UNK> in just over fifteen minutes the film takes us on a journey that most full length features can't even match great performances excellent camera work and editing this short is a classic from start to finish kudos to travis davis for pulling double duty as both director and star he's the funniest <UNK> since woody allen and what a treat to see richard <UNK> back again if you thought all he could do was play bull the <UNK> on night court think again this gem of a film showcases the brilliantly funny writing of stephen remember that name forget charlie kaufman steve is the true current king of quirky comedy
<START> if this movie would have been in english all critics would have <UNK> it the language is extremely bad the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny after the movie i thought that this movie could have been written by an <UNK> <UNK> at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the <UNK> on certain male body parts oh on dogs as well the story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature <UNK> <UNK> that premiered almost at the same time of course the public chose while <UNK> <UNK> got little attention br br what was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad that was probably due to the fact that first time director <UNK> <UNK> used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it for fun i suppose the result however is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them this was very frustrating maybe <UNK> <UNK> should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can master br br another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together at several times in the middle of the movie the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable br br and then i have not mentioned the 2 dimensional characters especially those in the supporting roles br br even though i consider this one of the worst swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated it is kind of understandable that the public liked it i mean bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses br br i'm more surprised that the critics enjoyed it they should have known better br br grade 2 of 10 br br
<START> when i watched <UNK> with my girlfriend she <UNK> how complicated and she is right of course when you are used to simple one linear plots especially violent hero vs crook schemes <UNK> is hard to follow a couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points other <UNK> about the confusing flash backs come on this is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet come back and get hooked again within a few seconds this one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when the director has left more than enough clues in all scenes br br the first 3 4 of the movie centers about the question why did max and lisa split the film as my girlfriend <UNK> begins as a romantic suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again having experience with french movies i predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and i was right in the end of the first part it becomes clear after many twists and turns that max and lisa were manipulated by alice max did not know that lisa had left and why lisa did not know why max did not contact her in rome and left her without a trace when she returned to paris the only one who did was alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut br br after both max and lisa have found out the truth the question of course becomes can <UNK> <UNK> be <UNK> well of course not time has passed by and things have changed br br many european movies use a story telling technique i fully enjoy there is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning after which two or more interested parties try to decide in their own advantage instead the <UNK> is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters <UNK> is a fine and subtle example of this technique in the first half alice seems to be a side character slowly it becomes clear that she is key figure br br acting is simply great vincent <UNK> is perfect as the somewhat naive and <UNK> character who risks a <UNK> life just to hunt a dream from the past monica is very beautiful of course but also competent jean paul provides the necessary comical touch is very convincing as the neurotic woman plagued by feelings of guilt and regret br br the only reason i did not gave it a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfying end of course it was necessary because of the desired <UNK> after all the events max is exactly on the point where the movie begun only <UNK> and <UNK> alice has paid for her sins but still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial max too easily <UNK> lisa for alice alice too easily decides to reject max who has been her dream for so long max too easily returns to his fiancée but then again i don't know how how this could be achieved without <UNK> the elegant <UNK> i guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty
<START> is the best movie of <UNK> one of the biggest hit in his career as i had not seen the movie so i could enjoy this movie even more the story is about a girl wanting to escape the <UNK> of a local <UNK> who wants to <UNK> marry her since he is a <UNK> so no body is ready to help the heroine <UNK> who had come to play a match there sees this and decides to help her the rest of the movie is how <UNK> helps her how the girl ultimately escapes the <UNK> of the <UNK> the father's political <UNK> the movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end <UNK> is as usual very good in role of the player the bunch of <UNK> friends all have done their job competently a special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie the <UNK> character has been properly <UNK> out and has portrayed it very well surprisingly for the first time i felt sympathy for the villain in the end the dialogue hi has really caught on with the masses the music by is brilliant and the song is a rage all over has to be credited with such a nice <UNK> movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard <UNK> fans but also by the general <UNK> movie audience all over the world
<START> the first disney animated film without the strong involvement of disney himself this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting this is i believe the only animated disney film since the 1940's which is not based on an earlier book or other work but is rather an original story as others have noted the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in lady and the tramp and the kidnapping journey home story in 101 <UNK> br br but to overcome this flaw the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the disney animated films of the previous 10 15 years phil harris from the jungle book <UNK> one of the main characters follows his <UNK> with louis <UNK> in the previous film with another here with <UNK> <UNK> the quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from <UNK> with some nice <UNK> to french <UNK> it appears and the villain here the butler is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well this is probably one of disney's least memorable villains the main story goes back and forth between the cats and the <UNK> ongoing difficulties with two rural <UNK> dogs with great voice work by pat and george lindsey the various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen tramp and <UNK> the owner while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in sleeping beauty bears none of that character's nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous br br the real strength of the film is the voice work after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in the jungle book the <UNK> is continued strongly here with disney veterans harris and sterling <UNK> from the jungle book and eva <UNK> who would do a very similar character in the later film the <UNK> as well as <UNK> and nancy all are excellent here particularly harris and <UNK> in the leads the character animation is as excellent as one would expect showing a variety of emotions well br br smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes an escape from the path of a <UNK> train a near drowning by one of the children but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly overall there's very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other disney classics br br one minor <UNK> is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are depicted among the jazz performing cats in supposedly <UNK> paris one can't help but wonder why the story wasn't set <UNK> in the present other than the great deal paris had changed much of its appearance in the <UNK> time it really would have made more sense that way br br the songs while being pleasant and sometimes very <UNK> performed are not particularly memorable nonetheless the general energy applied here the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses far from the greatness of classic 10 s such as <UNK> or <UNK> and not quite up to the 9 s one might give to sleeping beauty or 101 <UNK> this is probably a rather <UNK> 8 of 10 perhaps a 7
<START> one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint br br this movie has you guessing throughout and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen there are no bad guys or good guys makes sure of that the characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them you care about what they have been through br br use an attention to details is <UNK> in this world of fast food movies and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable you love the feeling it gives you br br i have heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell thank you for proving that false br br run don't walk to see this movie
<START> i had enjoyed the masters of horror series until i came upon this <UNK> dung heap br br this anti bush propaganda piece <UNK> as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original batman done by michael moore political satire should be clever this however pulls a ten on the <UNK> scale with all the style and credibility of an l ron <UNK> film br br in its campy inane way it <UNK> the <UNK> of stealing <UNK> going to war for absolutely no reason and treating <UNK> and women as mere cannon fodder it even takes a <UNK> at the second <UNK> and religion all that was missing was <UNK> romero as the president <UNK> in glee about how he <UNK> 9 11 br br i guess the ending was supposed to be the we support our troops moment but i think they would be more offended than pleased with the entire <UNK> br br i'm sure the hollywood <UNK> are sitting in their <UNK> <UNK> each other on the backs for this <UNK> work while the anti war <UNK> <UNK> it as genius br br time to get <UNK> with new hats kids
<START> previous <UNK> have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and the third man director carol <UNK> classic film noir starring orson welles and joseph <UNK> this similarity strikes the viewer almost immediately it is indeed high praise to be compared to robert academy award winning cinematography in the third man br br the plot of stolen identity also has been <UNK> fairly accurately but in rather ordinary terms i found it highly creative and entertaining as common as the mistaken or stolen identity device is in both theater and cinema it is only a device and not to be mistaken for the plot itself consequently while the viewer may have seen this device a thousand times the plot of stolen identity is full of surprises and twists based upon this device it is the unexpected turns that make this film much <UNK> more original and engrossing than a plot synopsis might convey stolen identity doesn't rely on the kind of suspense that <UNK> most film <UNK> because there is no real mystery here instead it relies on constant smaller surprises in short the mistaken identity device is rather common but this plot is not br br finally although i was not familiar with the cast i found the acting to be uniformly good occasionally outstanding i easily could have imagined other actors turning this film into a melodrama with <UNK> overblown gestures and obvious facial expressions the acting is always more restrained and subtle donald is especially restrained and credible never blowing his cover with an obvious facial expression as we see too often in films that depend on the <UNK> of <UNK> to sustain dramatic tension br br the only disappointment in this otherwise fine film was the very weak development of the love story sub plot as it stands it seems like an <UNK> a mild surprise in fact tacked on to the end or perhaps during their shared ordeal the actors simply couldn't convey a <UNK> level of chemistry that i could appreciate this sub plot should have been made more apparent as the story <UNK> all in all i thought this film was a fine little gem and i wondered why i had not seen it before try it you'll like it
<START> the last time i laughed this much it's a testament to the talent of <UNK> <UNK> that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality without hardly ever speaking a word the whole success of the program rests on <UNK> shoulders but he carries it with ease despite the fact that the show only ran for one season anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture <UNK> the rubber faced social so great is the talent and effort put into the performance at times <UNK> at times lovable mr bean is an innocent unlucky <UNK> who also happens to be evil <UNK> the brilliance of this character cannot be put into words you have to see for yourself br br the show gets almost too depressing at times like in the infamous new year's eve sketch or when bean <UNK> his birthday by going alone to a restaurant offering himself a <UNK> card signed by himself and being served a stake he doesn't quite fancy still there are times when you can't help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which bean gets himself out of trouble like when he <UNK> of said stake in numerous clever ish ways or when he changes into swimming <UNK> without taking his <UNK> off first whatever your reaction to bean and his <UNK> lifestyle you're bound to throw fits of laughter while watching br br finally i'd like to point out that although bean is classified as a program for children it is just as enjoyable for any grown up with a sense of humour because the more adult jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick yes there is such a thing is funny no matter what age you are bean is the <UNK> definition of a family show this is <UNK> a classic and it always <UNK> up my day
<START> this film is probably the best new french film i've seen in this century so far there have been some great ones including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> des arts and none of them come close to les <UNK> timeless glory br br the movie is a description of the events of may <UNK> and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of and a homage to the <UNK> vague movies of those days concerning the depiction of the <UNK> in paris the movie is <UNK> accurate i'm only 19 and i wasn't there myself but you know what i mean and the almost real time and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of paris the <UNK> are not <UNK> or beautifully photographed like the ones in <UNK> the <UNK> to which the movie is comparable in many ways instead they are filmed in <UNK> black and white shots courtesy of the excellent william the love story that is the movie's main concern after the <UNK> in <UNK> is filmed in stunning and far less <UNK> shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environment br br this film is a beautiful love story and it <UNK> through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late 60's which makes the film all the more compelling but the film is also a homage to the whole <UNK> vague <UNK> much of the dialogue evokes early <UNK> and the length and non action and plot less structure is reminiscent of <UNK> or <UNK> there are even godard like effects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing <UNK> directly this film is no doubt an answer song to <UNK> the <UNK> and it is also a <UNK> vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and <UNK> love story br br bottom line this movie is incredible and if you love french cinema you shouldn't sleep on it it may be the finest french film since <UNK> la et la <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of cinema br br the script was diabolical so bad in fact that i was almost crying with laughter at some of the things they came out with the acting was almost as bad they would have been better off casting traffic <UNK> to play the roles they would have done a better job the murders were laughable the suspense was non existent the camera work was <UNK> and the major plot twist at the end was <UNK> inappropriate it just gets worse and worse br br the <UNK> is possibly one of the most <UNK> villains caught on film she looks like she is wearing a cheap mask from the supermarket the hair caused endless amounts of laughter and a <UNK> <UNK> would you be scared by that i certainly wasn't br br if you like watching bad movies see <UNK> <UNK> 2 michael bay films then this is a must see those who don't like bad movies and don't enjoy laughing at shockingly bad dialogue avoid like the plague
<START> if there were an for film then this movie would get their most sincere <UNK> if we all recycled our stuff to this degree we'd never run out of anything br br funny how i was reminded of this movie when i first saw i the phantom menace at least lucas didn't <UNK> his old footage br br this is a dud but it's a nice dud cute in spots i liked when the kid said damn rocks and if you like explosions even recycled ones you will get your fill br br actually for an obviously no budget film it makes out fairly well acting is weak but there is a little characterisation here and there story is predictable but will lead you along anyhow br br this is an everybody chases the kid type of movie which probably will appeal mostly to younger audiences i gave this one a 2 out of 10 br br i <UNK> up my old vhs copy of this film i don't think it's on dvd
<START> ok this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked the zombie make up was extremely fake the acting is very poor and it doesn't really follow the first one while watching this i kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this i would say catch it on tv don't spend your money on it its not the worst movie i've ever seen but its on the list i started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again the plot was pointless i mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying if you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either the plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner with these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived out of a 1 10 i give it a 2
<START> this film is an absolute disgrace i thoroughly enjoyed the original airport and i can't believe how the same people could produce this <UNK> nine years on first of all the acting is bad the original had actors who had done quality non disaster films before but this one uses actors who have done the disaster movie circuit already <UNK> kennedy wagner also george <UNK> character <UNK> seems to get promoted very quickly he is now the lead in the film but his character isn't strong enough to carry it off he has lost the charm and humour of airport 1970 and the character is now just boring have i mentioned the plot is it at all believable that someone would send a missile after the <UNK> no there are also too many loose ends scenes that have no relevance whatsoever to the plot the scene where the hot air balloon lands on the <UNK> the chase of the thief in charles de airport are two such scenes both would be interesting if only they had something to do with the actual story there also many unanswered questions why does <UNK> open the window and fire a <UNK> at the other plane why does robert <UNK> character kill himself he must have another stupid and <UNK> way of why is there no <UNK> after the missile almost blows up the <UNK> why are the back <UNK> so bad it looks as though a cartoon missile is following the <UNK> although it does work well when the plane lands in paris why does <UNK> think that he is in a flight <UNK> when he turns the <UNK> over why does he get a hero's welcome in the cabin of the plane after having terrified the passengers and why is the ending so poor if it can be called an ending at all given their one dimensional <UNK> no one seems to notice this the <UNK> given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's coach is the man who plays the <UNK> is annoying and the woman with the <UNK> problem is just plain silly the scenes where susan <UNK> is lying on the roof of her <UNK> and the when she tells wagner that she still loves him are quite awful in conclusion this film should have been the climax of the previous three airport films instead it is a diabolical sub moronic complete and utter waste of time money energy celluloid and talent remember when <UNK> asks the french pilot if he has ever landed on his belly this film certainly does the belly flop and lands flat on its <UNK> nose
<START> when i was younger and today mr bean is a work of genius three time <UNK> nominated <UNK> <UNK> stars as the almost silent <UNK> human looking alien dropped onto earth causing chaos and <UNK> wherever he goes he has tried to do an <UNK> put his pants on in front of blind man he didn't know he was blind gone to church tried to dive at a swimming pool made lunch on a park <UNK> seen a scary movie changed in his car had a <UNK> with a fly <UNK> spent christmas with his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> looked after a baby in been to room of the queens hotel in won a pet contest with his teddy driven on top of his mini on a new chair and even met and knocked out the queen guests included <UNK> walker richard <UNK> <UNK> nick <UNK> from they think it's all over caroline quentin the day today's david schneider richard wilson the fast show's <UNK> and the <UNK> of roger lloyd pack it was nominated the <UNK> for best comedy programme or series and best light entertainment programme <UNK> <UNK> was number 18 on the 50 greatest british actors he was number 24 on the <UNK> comedian and he was number 8 on <UNK> favourite comedian outstanding
<START> the show was amazing and very professional madonna is a non stop dancing and singing for 2 hours the opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and also jump was a really good performance the entire show was full of energy so it's kind of hard to say which were the highlights because every song had something special and unique i saw live couple of her previous <UNK> drowned world and <UNK> tour they were good but you can't compare with this one the dancers were fantastic the lights and the whole show were just perfect madonna still looks very good if you haven't seen it yet i highly recommend you to see it you'll enjoy the show from the beginning to the end madonna is still the dancing queen
<START> the beautiful country is a big disappointment it doesn't come up to my expectation a tall muscular guy is a son of an american <UNK> and a <UNK> woman during vietnam war we were told that that he was treated less than dust in vietnam in the early 90s so he to america to seek his american father br br sounds like a heart broken material maybe but showing in this film i find myself having a hard time to connect to emotionally because the film is full of cliché and i simply don't understand or believe him the writing of this film is a total failure the plot is full of holes it grabs some events on a needed basis trying hard to stir the emotion of the audience we are not that stupid and it doesn't work that way let's see what the film is trying to do so you don't feel boat trip yeah he was on a boat is hard enough let's have a storm over night and let the ship shake a little still not touched fine get a little kid to suffer the heat the hungry the sickness the violence with the adults on the boat hopefully that will do the trick to touch the audience still not touched you heartless <UNK> let's ok i don't want to give any spoiler of the film but you get the idea br br the film is really long and slow it never tell us why didn't go to find his mom and dad until the moment in the film when he left to look for his mom and dad what has he been doing the 20 some years before he went to <UNK> to look for his mom and guess what he has the luck and everybody will tell him where to find the person he is looking for and he will find anybody without a scratch i really think the department of <UNK> security should hire those <UNK> who helped the beautiful country which one both vietnam and america seem hell to
<START> if i could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating i would i was stupid enough to pick this dvd up in the shop read the <UNK> and think that sounds quite good i'll spend <UNK> and buy it all i got at the end of it was a <UNK> coaster absolutely awful i don't even know where to begin i have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because i can't think of one good thing to say about it br br the plot is basically 7 people go into an <UNK> cave one of them is a reporter no one else knows they are there when they get in the cave they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster there turns out to be no reason for the reporter one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend <UNK> in a cave 2 years ago there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume anyway the monster turns out to be a guy that <UNK> into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life this for no reason makes him <UNK> able to glow see in the dark take bullets breathe underwater be in 2 places at once and have insane strength able to move <UNK> carry grown men as dead weight etc br br in the end scene there are 2 women left alive they wake up naked just covered in some bit of <UNK> or something they then find a picture of a kid the monster then bursts in the door wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head says in the directors commentary it was a skull if so that would be the biggest crow i have seen in my life and quite literally goes like a kiddie on halloween i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave that is the extent of the back story to why he <UNK> people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one cut to end credits i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene br br there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end aside from all this the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off an absolutely terrible film you might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it it would be money better spent as like some clever person <UNK> above me said once you've watched it you can't un watch it
<START> debbie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and sue knight want to become one of the cool girls in their high school <UNK> and ugly girls had two <UNK> be a mole or a <UNK> debbie and sue imitate them by using their cheating practices in an <UNK> two of the cool boys <UNK> and danny tony hughes ask them for their answers and they all get <UNK> after a <UNK> out from the <UNK> bud <UNK> the cool girls meet them outside in the <UNK> and confronted them about whether they <UNK> on them all as debbie and sue hadn't the cool girls invited them to the for a smoke they then start to hang with them on <UNK> at the beach watching all the boys surf sue ends up going out with danny and debbie with <UNK> a lot of usual teenage action takes place including sex drugs and rock and roll <UNK> has an eventual <UNK> of heroin which makes debbie face the of life and she decides to learn to surf instead of just watching the boys they are not happy but watch her calling names and eventually debbie masters the board a cool early 80s aussie film
<START> i like hack think the lone ranger <UNK> as a <UNK> cab driver a decent but flawed guy in philadelphia doing his best while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past and you've got the synopsis david morse is nearly perfect as he helps people but instead of riding silver in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary <UNK> without <UNK> out silver bullets the supporting cast is first class and well above average at times the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series the <UNK> files this show deserves a return hopefully in a better time <UNK> than <UNK> friday eastern
<START> it was awful plain and simple what was their message where was the movie going with this it has all the ingredients of a sub b grade movie from <UNK> storyline the bad acting to the <UNK> slow mo cinematography i'd sooner watch a movie i've already seen like <UNK> a <UNK> tale even grease there are no likeable characters in the end you just want everyone to die already save 2 hours of your life and skip this one
<START> nemesis game is a mind <UNK> film filled with <UNK> death mystery and philosophy in it's <UNK> sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all the search for answers leads sarah novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling the final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth yet sarah is so close to understanding it all what would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life br br the movie was written and directed by jesse warn while this was first feature length film the movie doesn't reflect that at all but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story <UNK> <UNK> was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch i would definitely love to see more of her work br br being based on <UNK> this is a very cerebral movie it's that's your thing as it is mine then i totally recommend seeing nemesis game rating 4 5 5
<START> i thought the movie was good but i like to read the real story behind the based on a true story movies does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters the movie is based on i have done a complete internet search and cannot find any information on this case all i get is the movie information and the fact that it is based on a true story i find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence rendered immediately in the courtroom even after such a heartfelt speech by the brother gorgeous john corbett but overall the story was very gripping anyway if anyone knows the real real story i would appreciate you sharing it
<START> went with some friends and one of my friends mom thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break but the movie turned out awful we all agree it shouldn't have been pg 13 more like r material lots of sexual dialog <UNK> and referring to boy and girl parts below the <UNK> not worth the time or money strongly urge you not to go or rent it when it comes out if you do end up going don't take smaller children not the type of movie to see with the family if curious about the content check out the content <UNK> section on the superhero movie page on imdb most of the content that was meant to be funny was extremely crude especially when they make fun of steven <UNK>
<START> as far as christian film goes it's typical lacking of a mega budget they try their best some times falling short sometimes hitting the mark this one almost hit great acting can only carry a movie so far a combining of h p <UNK> and frank <UNK> was a good idea <UNK> it needed was better back story and better character development to make it great movie the visuals are not that bad also smart holding off the demons till the last few minutes helped keep the suspense at a good pace could of used a better ending though not a bad premise having terrorists experiments go wrong much better than typical hollywood treatment about the demonic realm maybe someone will finally do this present darkness as a movie
<START> forgettable pilot that never really explains why <UNK> is really important to the plot of this movie but rob <UNK> plays a a hunky cop who happens to be <UNK> for some reason and who battles time travelling medieval monks that run around with guns and set people on fire to start the apocalypse oh yeah there's also a sexy fbi agent who happens to be a and is trying to get rob to believe everything before it's too late too bad they couldn't predict a better plot yawn br br
<START> my young <UNK> is unique in a lot of ways first this is <UNK> ya <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> first action film second she was actually doing the fight scenes after having a surgery done to her a few days before filming third this movie is off the chain br br the movie starts out with wang lung <UNK> trying to take the inheritance from his brother his brother then has <UNK> to marry him so wang can't take the treasure the story is pretty good leading everything to it's <UNK> place br br in comes the action what can i say that hasn't already been said for movies like this or <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> the victim or even the magnificent butcher the fight scenes are what sales movie and this one won't have any problem doing so liu <UNK> <UNK> and wang lung <UNK> engaged in a fight that you have to see to believe why have these two men not fought each other more is beyond me br br i don't want to spoil anything really but you have to see my young <UNK> to get the full blast of excitement my only <UNK> is that <UNK> <UNK> was not used as broad as he was used in 3 evil masters or even <UNK> pole fighter 8 <UNK> pole fighter to excellent must see movies 9 2 10
<START> i am disgusted and appalled by the positive reviews this movie is receiving not only is it hokey manipulative and melodramatic it's also shamelessly offensive the character of radio gooding jr ' is <UNK> around as a cute little stuff animal like a puppy that's so cute you just want to take him home ' this mentality is shameless radio is never treated as a human being but as a manipulative device to draw <UNK> from its audience even more atrocious are the film's numerous moments in which radio gets hit in the head <UNK> falls over etc these moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter merely purely because it's funny because radio is this is shameless now i do not feel that the word is an appropriate word at all to describe the mentally disabled but this seems to be the stance the film is taking radio is retarded but that's okay because he's cute and we like him ' <UNK> portrayal seems better suited for a john <UNK> film than an inspiring family drama to add insult to injury the film is incompetent on every level debra <UNK> is uninspired in the role as the stereotypical <UNK> that the very reminder of her <UNK> monologues insights laughter in all who see the film the score by john <UNK> is pure <UNK> always its tear some score over the tired cinematography ed harris is decent in a role he could have slept through but manages to retain much of the audience's attention throughout the film in conclusion if you consider yourself a decent human being ignore this travesty of a film read the book but otherwise skip this dire film on an interesting character from american history
<START> this film <UNK> the australian films road warrior and <UNK> of the desert and its influence on them is obvious in the dialogue locations photography direction and political philosophy the photography is notably confident the direction is stylish and for the most part well done if you liked the early australian films by bruce <UNK> peter <UNK> and george miller then you'll love oz the direction also reminds this reviewer of edgar <UNK> contemporary work that similarity suggests that oz was far ahead of its time the critics of 1967 hated it and the public stayed away 1960s australia like 1940s usa was in some ways the sort of place where <UNK> was important whereas this film is very different to what those viewers would have expected especially after reading the <UNK> posters this film will most likely have more appeal to contemporary audiences it's still <UNK> awkward and self conscious but in a contemporary european way rather than a 1960s australian way joy <UNK> who later appeared in the australian tv series plays her role with less raw passion than her contemporary weaver might have done instead character in this film conveys some of the rather whimsical strength of australian women most <UNK> represented by <UNK> <UNK> playing <UNK> mitchell in the australian tv series <UNK> and further developed in later roles in her career men will also enjoy this film which presents various <UNK> issues in a different way than most other mid sixties films from the usa or even australia in particular bruce <UNK> who later went on to play in <UNK> wars <UNK> the in the <UNK> films and the <UNK> pilot in the <UNK> and films plays a central and <UNK> role which <UNK> supports the rest of the cast this film is worth seeing for bruce performance alone 7 10 for some minor continuity problems
<START> as always joan is wonderful as jane m subtle sharp and aware i do not wish to <UNK> on her acting skills as they are praised enough on this site i would like to criticize some of the smaller parts as the rest of the cast seemed to be hand picked by director david tucker br br liz <UNK> performance as mrs bent the mother of the missing girl nora is a joy to watch subtle and deeply moving as the alcohol depending <UNK> mother who loves and misses her daughter desperately a good long shot of her monologue thanks tucker so she can be enjoyed to the <UNK> i was moved when i saw her the first time when it was broadcast and i am moved again now i have it on dvd <UNK> br br joanna hole as <UNK> the tour guide i find highly amusing she is on the edge of over acting but her role can have it she is so funny as the over organized guide who wants to do good with everyone on that bus i find her hilarious her reaction after she <UNK> every one on the bus is great as always to perform comedy one has to take it very seriously and that's what ms hole does br br i do hope those two ladies have good careers as i live in holland i do not know if they have not all theater productions can be <UNK> their performances on the screen deserve it br br
<START> i had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the miami film festival this past saturday and let me just say i was <UNK> it was the only film out of the whole program that i loved it is beautifully shot composed edited acted and written after the screening i saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next he said that he was working on finding <UNK> for the feature version of the short he described some scenes to me it sounded like the kind of first film that <UNK> the <UNK> into the industry if you ever get a chance to see this short i highly recommend taking it hats off to star crossed
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen thank god i saw it for free i would have hated to waste my money on it br br first off there isn't a character in the movie that is in any way likable michael caine comes close but even he is pretty flawed the rest of the <UNK> are made up of disgusting ex cons there are the two gay <UNK> and three guys who try to rape a red cross nurse and the leader who has no trouble sending his men off to get killed so he can escape br br the mission is anything from suspenseful they are to blow up a fuel dump sounds exciting right well the footage follows them through endless and <UNK> flat <UNK> yes you read that right the suspense is whether they will run out of spare <UNK> we actually watch them change something like 12 <UNK> on the way that's how incredibly exciting this movie is br br they get to the fuel dump to find that it is a <UNK> so nothing to blow up and at this time for some very convoluted reason the british army decides that they don't need these guys anymore and <UNK> their <UNK> to the germans to kill them br br so now at least we'll have an exciting race to freedom nope instead they decide to blow up a different fuel dump to create a <UNK> but when they get into the place they set off a trip wire and the germans come to get them calling out their names over a <UNK> br br really weird if the germans knew where they were and where they were going why did they let them get all the way into the dump before <UNK> the trap instead they wait until they get into the fuel <UNK> and set all of their charges yeah right that would happen br br so they blow the dump the leader sells out all of his men except for michael caine since he's been offered 2000 to bring him back alive br br ok so the men are all betrayed and killed and michael caine and <UNK> <UNK> survive the british troops come in with tanks and they decide to go get rescued since they are wearing german uniforms they wore them to blow up the dump they tie a white flag around a stick and walk out into the road br br some british guy walks up them and machine guns them to death credits roll br br yep the two heroes of the movie die due to a random act of violence br br it's almost like the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided that's a wrap kill them off and we'll go home i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired unimaginative and totally unrealistic movie that ended with a of a bomb
<START> and so it started with a send up of horror films then we had scary movie a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre the <UNK> send up however now we have scary movie scary movie 2 scary movie 3 scary movie 4 date movie meet the <UNK> not another team movie plus many more genuinely funny movies marked with br br and super hero movie it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send ups funny using the rip offs from other movies in a funny way is all well and good if done properly but not many producers seem to know how to do that scary movie 1 did it well the following sequels were then horrendous as the tried to over play the franchise but it was redeemed by scary movie 4 not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofs well and to its credit i am sick of teen movies however this movie plays like a bad version of all of these it relies on slap stick the would make even the 3 stooges cringe <UNK> the image of stephen <UNK> and then when people begin to get bored and the producers knew when this would be we are treated to pamela anderson in a skin tight suit to conclude spoofs should be about making a homage like mock up of an original movie with an original storyline not random take offs of legitimate film onto the storyline of a real film br br i <UNK> at the thought of sci fi movie and get my <UNK> knife ready
<START> i was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with spoilers the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isn't given away on the back of the box is given away in the title perhaps i am just a dense american 17 year old who wouldn't know art if it bit me in the leg but i prefer movies that have at least some words this movie makes the second half of 2001 a space odyssey down right <UNK> this movie is just so slow it isn't even art it is merely boring we follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around <UNK> the end was incomprehensible until i read the end of book a movie shouldn't make you refer back to the book it should be able to stand alone this movie has no way to stand it doesn't even have the bones of a plot to lean on
<START> <UNK> day br br i bought this movie this past week and waited for some time where i could kick back and relax and watch some good 80's slasher gems i got this and <UNK> to watch never seen any of them i just watched it and realized my <UNK> <UNK> were on also i only imagine what my neighbors thought when came on to sing their one 10 minute hit i'm sure it was loud and i'm sure they think i'm weird with that and the chainsaw sound and screaming from other movies br br this was a pretty sub par slasher movie no suspense no story some cool deaths almost seemed on the amateur side i usually like movies like that but it just didn't click with me now i will watch <UNK> for the 1st time and have a <UNK> br br dj eric austin <UNK>
<START> someone else called this film a fable horror movie and i think that fits pretty well that's the concept at least a group of teenagers each with their own vice catch the eye of a twisted <UNK> barker he decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show a cool idea but could have been executed better the fate for some of the teens is shoved in your face too obviously while other characters could have been fleshed out more also the ending was a serious let down no resolution or big twist or anything br br but as a low budget horror movie it's pretty fun to watch if you're into cheesy you should have a laugh watching this one i think one of it's faults though that it takes itself too seriously it's a silly movie and if it was a little more self aware when it comes to that i think it would have been better but at least there's enough neat carnival themes and b movie monster makeup to keep you watching
<START> this is one of the best horror suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill thrills and yes a lot of gore house of wax sure delivers in parts it was sort of far fetched the acting was not that great but my <UNK> rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats this is just the right movie for you i have to admit it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax i myself enjoy these <UNK> but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way
<START> most people are totally unaware that this movie exists fox which paid judge to make it has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it i guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being <UNK> in late summer well i am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe basically judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are the smart by a wide <UNK> then these stupid are getting more stupid by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex which produces more stupid people by <UNK> a person of average intelligence today will appear to be a genius that talks all seriously is this really that hard to believe oh sure this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one liners like can we family style her and hey man i'm here this is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be with self pleasure comfort and stupidity and i guarantee you that i will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over
<START> i'm really not going to waste my time with in depth analysis i'm just going to say that i'm extremely disappointed that catherine zeta jones made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd nonsense in this full of clichés boring to death <UNK> pathetic try in film making there is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie because as a whole it is poor in every single way and the saddest thing is that zeta jones is dragged so <UNK> into the clichés that she has absolutely no chance of showing even 1 of her talent br br avoid this movie even at the opportunity of spending the night at home starring at the wall
<START> i was very impressed with this film from newcomer <UNK> writer jose <UNK> the cast was excellent <UNK> executed a powerful br br and shocking performance as the lead character of it's inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent br br it takes talent courage and determination to go out and make a quality film br br i admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile br br it's easy for people to judge young filmmakers more <UNK> but i applaud jose <UNK> br br and the talented cast for their successful efforts
<START> i just saw it at the toronto international film festival director <UNK> impressive starring cast includes william macy seen in the <UNK> at last year's <UNK> meat <UNK> aka meat <UNK> aka michael lee david <UNK> and laura dern also starring in <UNK> also at this year's festival br br based on the arthur miller novel by the same name focus follows christian but jewish looking lawrence newman macy as he struggles among the hatred and anti <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> between the jewish store owner down the street <UNK> and his card carrying anti <UNK> next door <UNK> meat <UNK> newman faces difficulty in dealing with inner conflict and conflict around him guilt over knowing what's right but not doing anything battles with wanting to blend in and keep peace with the <UNK> things gets more complex when he meets and marries <UNK> dern who everyone thinks is jewish <UNK> teaches her husband a few things about judging books by covers br br will newman stick up for the jewish man in the end or will he flee go see it to find out br br the acting was fabulous the writing was incredible the cinematography was excellent the sound was well done technically amazing the movie was disturbing chilling emotionally intense i found myself bringing my knees up into the <UNK> position a couple of times i have great admiration for everyone who worked on it i have not seen a film this good in a long time it touched me br br wow
<START> hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a film even if they have to keep dragging out stereotypes and putting them in the most impossible and stupid situations this effort is a clear example of that and i really do believe in my heart that a film like this is <UNK> irresponsible story is about a divorced lawyer named peter <UNK> steve martin who has been <UNK> with a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her she turns out to be the opposite of what he was expecting <UNK> <UNK> queen <UNK> is a <UNK> black woman who has no intentions of dating peter but instead wants him to look at her case where she was convicted of robbery he wants her to leave for good but she keeps popping up at inappropriate times and to save his job he reluctantly agrees to look at the facts involving her case br br spoiler alert br br peter has his kids staying with him and <UNK> turns out to be helpful in raising them but suddenly a news <UNK> <UNK> that an escaped convict named <UNK> <UNK> has broken out of prison peter tells her to leave when the fbi comes <UNK> around but he figures out that she is in fact innocent when her old boyfriend shows up and threatens him br br this film is directed by adam who keeps things moving at a nice pace and it is a good looking film technically speaking but the script is just so improbable and every character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 film called the <UNK> is clearly more in tune with race relations than this mess i have always been a big fan of martin and i think he's one of the most talented persons around but he loves to work constantly and at times just seems to pick any script handed to him on the other hand i've always had a problem with <UNK> and the way she into the life of martin is so over the top that she instantly becomes <UNK> basic premise that hollywood loves to use is the hip black person showing uptight <UNK> to <UNK> up and then pass on some street logic that will help them with their lives that's basically what the story is here but of course they have to let martin dress black and <UNK> like a retarded <UNK> because hollywood knows that this is what viewers want well i was pretty much insulted by everything in this film and it's not because i don't have a sense of humor but unfortunately for hollywood anyway i use logic and common sense when i watch a film yes i enjoyed eugene talking <UNK> but are we really suppose to believe that he would be instantly attracted to <UNK> i guess <UNK> things have happened and how many times does a main actor get shot only to be saved by something in their pocket wouldn't a cell phone <UNK> if struck by a bullet even if your the most die hard martin and <UNK> fan i wouldn't recommend this i know i've said this before but this isn't an attempt to make a good film it's an excuse to try and make money
<START> a teenage film about angst friendship loyalty and growing but this isn't a happy outing on its part due to the circumstances and life changing <UNK> surrounding the premise what <UNK> is quite numbing haunting and downright cold however i was expecting something a little more powerful and effective and while engrossing and unforgettable it didn't entirely stir up much in the way of emotions the performances are reasonably a mixed bag but there's a brutal honesty to them all dennis hopper and especially daniel <UNK> are <UNK> glover <UNK> over does it and keanu <UNK> dead as wood turn seems to pay off in his <UNK> <UNK> role joshua john <UNK> is quite good and so is <UNK> <UNK> jim <UNK> <UNK> in with a short but highly engaging performance the story is dramatically confronting character laced and harrowing in its eventual breakdown where it <UNK> a gritty and painful punch <UNK> <UNK> music score is <UNK> with anxiety tension and wonder as the morals and <UNK> are tested and <UNK>
<START> this was unusual a modern day film which was ultra nice in fact it was so nice it <UNK> on being too hard to believe in parts as i watching this based on a real life story i was thinking nobody is this nice this <UNK> mainly i was referring to ed <UNK> role as coach jones i think they went a little overboard on his character but that's better than the reverse showing him worse than what he was in real life odd to see harris playing the role too since he has a long resume of playing nasty <UNK> characters br br anyway i never complain about a nice feel good film and it is nice to see a bunch of well meaning kind people those folks direct their friendship love and compassion to james kennedy better known as radio a mentally slow high school kid played by cuba gooding jr the story takes place in the mid 1970s in south <UNK> gooding does a nice job with the role too however like sean <UNK> role of a mentally challenged man in i am sam an hour and a half of a character like this is plenty after that the <UNK> of those guys gets tiresome to hear br br note it was interesting in one of the documentaries on this dvd to find out that in real life in took years for radio to make his transformation not months as shown in the film
<START> this movie is an almost forgotten gem from 1979 which although in essence a comedy it was based on one of the <UNK> biggest ever bank <UNK> in fact one of the titles that this film is known by includes caper therefore that in its self is an indication of the type of movie a of a bunch of lovable <UNK> who are not the violent or psychotic types who with cheek an <UNK> pull off the biggest job of their lives to be honest i don't really know too much about the real crime and can't comment if it accurately depicted the events that <UNK> or the characters involved br br richard jordan handles himself very well playing <UNK> green and is very believable as an easy going small time american born crook who seems very comfortable with himself i have to add that sometimes american actors struggle <UNK> well with english actors in a british made film the chemistry is not always there however this is no problem for who fits right in with his role br br it's worth pointing out that jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70's and 80's and never really got the recognition he deserved he seemed to get stuck in supporting roles and b movies not a fair representation of his acting ability he has played a corrupt cop in the friends of eddy <UNK> a sadistic killer in the mean season in the secret of my success he played a sort of comical gordon character and also in the 1980's <UNK> tv show he played a good guy all of this displays the <UNK> of his acting skills while mixing with the likes of david niven kurt russell edward <UNK> and robert br br in this movie he effortlessly plays his part as a small time crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning you can't help liking green   you see he really did want to go straight but once <UNK> it all seemed too much of an opportunity to pass up and in the end he <UNK> the thought of all that money br br david niven is the boss and calls the shots the police inspector was brilliantly played by richard johnson who typically portrayed a smarmy but <UNK> london detective who clearly loves his job the other supporting cast don't say too much but looking at them they were all very well known british character actors who often found themselves playing either villains or <UNK> isn't that ironic <UNK> oliver <UNK> do what they have to do and it's good to see gloria graham in a cameo role br br to some viewers particularly americans it would seem ludicrous that somebody with <UNK> record could land a <UNK> job at of all things a bank and come and go when he <UNK> in addition the stunt he pulled at the crown court after <UNK> was not as far fetched as it might seem back in the 1960's and 70's security was not as nearly as tight as it is now br br as for the movie itself there are a couple of interesting observations with small time crooks the <UNK> here was too much there have been other movies where this occurs too i e the <UNK> it's not just the <UNK> or the hiding of the <UNK> but with so many people involved somebody is going to be <UNK> is going to or just simply break once <UNK> on in addition the authorities come down on very hard on local <UNK> when such huge robbery is carried out also they say there is no honor amongst thieves but <UNK> was <UNK> that <UNK> got his <UNK> you only had too look at his stare in the <UNK> if looks could kill a look of total betrayal how could he have <UNK> them all in after taking care of him you have to ask yourself a question why is it that crooks can be so stupid did green really think that he could sweet talk his way out of suspicion a second time around inspector was not at all fooled by his innocent looking face as well as a well constructed <UNK> the whole caper <UNK> of inside job in addition you have to wonder why they leave so many clues a note pad with the safe numbers <UNK> down travel <UNK> for overseas <UNK> still leaving his <UNK> around as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery which was out of character br br with some decent but common sense police work <UNK> quickly had the measure of green picked him up and soon had him singing like a <UNK> it just shows how despite well thought out planning things can unravel very quickly there is never a clean <UNK> for every body some are always going to get <UNK> although it's worth pointing out that a lot of the money was never <UNK> br br all in all an entertaining movie interesting shots of london and england in the late 70's well paced with a great ending i would highly recommend this particularly if you enjoy <UNK> note i recently purchased a dvd of this but the transfer was obviously taken from a vhs tape and is of poor quality therefore do not pay too much for it
<START> anyone who <UNK> fine acting and <UNK> dialogue will love br br this film taken from ronald <UNK> <UNK> it's a funny br br and ultimately <UNK> analysis of a relationship between two br br very types albert finney is sublime as the <UNK> br br shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging br br around him so intent is he on the <UNK> <UNK> of his theatre br br company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown br br tom is <UNK> as norman the of the title br br whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but <UNK> br br really a must see
<START> with a name like 10 <UNK> you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible specifically <UNK> not so here this is standard <UNK> with any biblical hallmark made film remember <UNK> that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made at least this film had some truth to the original story however who was a major character in this movie half brother of <UNK> is not in the original story other characters were absent not to mention important events were completely eliminated so what you may ask because this should be representative of the actual story otherwise some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened in today's age people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible also it is a great error see revelation 22 18 19 the script is already written why change it other than the account in <UNK> itself which should be the main focus you have the cecil b demille film to compare it to which is clearly a far better presentation br br the night it first aired my wife was anxious to see it i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmark film she looked puzzled and said why hallmark makes good movies that might be so but they butcher the bible i'm sorry to say that i was correct not just the story but the acting as well with today's technology you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie i'm still waiting
<START> if you wish to have a truly traumatic experience than this awful motion picture if you may consider to call it that is for you a film worse than the <UNK> <UNK> beach u s a batman and robin <UNK> fair game well you get my point this film directed by french television sensation patrick <UNK> jerry springer with an i q of 25 can truly be considered the worst film ever made i do hope that troma or someone in america would <UNK> it so that the u s a can experience the french <UNK> at it's worth
<START> i am writing this review simply because i am a huge fan of the book <UNK> nation and was appalled by the film br br i think that if you hadn't read the book you would have been lost watching the film as it provided no real back story to depression there was no real mention of her childhood her relationship with her father her experiences at summer camp her first <UNK> in fact the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until dr sterling that said if you had read the book you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place br br i found the book to be a vivid portrayal of depression <UNK> low points and the experiences she had along the way the film however began at <UNK> and literally threw the audience straight in with no real explanation of what was going on br br events that in the book were important such as <UNK> her summer working in dallas her suicide attempt whilst on <UNK> were <UNK> from the film br br also this is <UNK> but did not lose her virginity to <UNK> the suicide attempt that was shown in <UNK> office was completely different to the book for a start she actually <UNK> on as opposed to the <UNK> <UNK> gesture shown in the film br br all in all i would say that if you have read the book and enjoyed it identified with it then don't watch the film read now <UNK> by the same author instead or watch girl interrupted br br the only redeeming feature was the performance by anne <UNK> who i believe portrayed dr sterling very well christina <UNK> was also good though her performance seemed a little stilted jessica lange made for enjoyable viewing but looked the opposite of how mother is described in the book br br conclusion don't bother
<START> this soap is worse than bad it's <UNK> of the many television shows that have had a <UNK> influence on british society over the past twenty years <UNK> is the prime example for two decades this show has celebrated the <UNK> the thug the wide boy the <UNK> the the violent the sexually the criminal the ignorant the br br how many times has someone or other <UNK> that <UNK> mirrors life life on which planet exactly br br it's written about working class characters as imagined by middle class people who have taken a course in creative writing eager to show to their middle class peers how familiar they are with the working class they dream up the <UNK> <UNK> that is the <UNK> of <UNK> br br this has a toxic effect on some minds less well <UNK> than others to handle fiction and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and <UNK> of the inhabitants of br br thus it came to pass that <UNK> mirrors life but only after life had been <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> br br other <UNK> have followed in footsteps filled to their <UNK> with ugly <UNK> faced <UNK> headed pot <UNK> characters <UNK> at each other and <UNK> <UNK> constantly this is the <UNK> as perceived by the writers who produce this trash the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such <UNK> and will go on to enjoy the <UNK> things of life in their <UNK> meanwhile the <UNK> number of new tv induced <UNK> will proceed <UNK> toward cultural <UNK> br br and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century much of this is due to the <UNK> power of that <UNK> of dancing in the corner of your living room it's your fault gentle reader that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison
<START> the director of this waste of celluloid <UNK> in dreadful exploitation films where <UNK> is all the previous year he did dangerously close whose good idea about gangs getting too much power in school and the school paper editor against them was <UNK> in a sea of <UNK> and he would go on to do cyborg jean claude van <UNK> worst film ever no mean feat this would be comedy about a girl kathy ireland in her film debut who's a total <UNK> whose inner babe is only <UNK> after she falls to the centre of the earth and has a set of badly filmed impossible to follow adventures <UNK> involving a set of <UNK> who want her because she has big bones go figure before returning home changed for the better isn't funny gripping or entertaining in the slightest and anybody watching this to <UNK> over miss ireland will be put off too not because of her voice but because she spends most of the film buried under tons of <UNK> clothes with huge glasses to boot no wonder cannon the producers are out of business amazingly kathy ireland has made better films since then or maybe that isn't so amazing next to this <UNK> wire is aliens
<START> the first time i saw alice in wonderland  an x rated musical comedy was in the early <UNK> in a movie theater in n y city with some friends i remember we actually enjoyed it very much although we were left wondering why all the <UNK> were covered by in various forms shaped colored <UNK> and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one leaving us guessing what we just missed obviously it was the soft core edited chopped version which left me with the desire to watch it again soon but in its original integral version well more then 20 years went by during which i forgot all about this movie and only a few days ago by sheer chance i stumbled upon a heavily used vhs copy which had seen better times a bit washed out colors <UNK> sound and a few flaws but guess what it's the original uncut version and this time i really had a ball humor musical and porn may sound an awkward combination but in this case it really works and unlikely the big majority of boring porn flicks nowadays <UNK> our screens this is a really amusing and entertaining sex fantasy which will not disappoint you the direction is clever the swift editing makes the movie fly like a bird all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain funny all the actors seem having a good time the songs are catchy worth mentioning the one about growing up sung by alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious what's a nice girl like you doing on a knight like this the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged amazingly energetic terry hall proves that she can also dance and dances <UNK> her guts away don't worry she also does what she was best known for the acting the singing the set the costumes are of quality level and then there is <UNK> blue eyes <UNK> in the first starring role of her career and oh boy she indeed has a few h c sequences personally i think they are absolutely not <UNK> on the contrary they are spontaneous and quite <UNK> she is young and <UNK> so very pretty with the help of her new friends in wonderland she discovers her body and her sexuality so she sings she dances and what do you expect she is also <UNK> sex the closing sequence when she finally makes love to her boy friend is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie i think her <UNK> du role the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile and her acting ability make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable there is plenty of sex going on in this wonderland and everybody seems eager to get busy with the first available boy s or girl s which means lot of hard core action to be seen on the other hand some close up shots clearly spliced in just to make the porn <UNK> really happy are a bit redundant for my personal taste in general however the sex action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it <UNK> almost <UNK> with the music the dances and the comedy if you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex watch it together take my word you will have an hour and a half of very good time perhaps also an after show extra action this is adult entertainment so be careful don't leave this video around or among other kid's videos if your 10 years old can put his hands on it he might <UNK> himself but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why this alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in lewis <UNK> novel or he watched on the disney's video i bet you will not forget this one of a kind very soon it's a real shame that they don't like that anymore i give it a 9 out of 10
<START> if it wasn't for the very attractive jennifer in the lead role i would have turned milo off after the first 30 minutes however as easy on the eyes as she is she's not enough to save this film not by a long shot br br milo starts off with a group of young girls accompanying an assumed young boy in a yellow <UNK> to a house in the woods where he shows them <UNK> in <UNK> apparently the deal was that if he showed them the <UNK> ol' milo gets to conduct a <UNK> on each in return one of the group <UNK> to be <UNK> first patient and he leads her behind closed doors moments later blood flows from under the door and we are <UNK> into present day enter the lovely who plays one of the girls all grown up in present day a substitute teacher with shallow confidence whose closest friend appears to be a <UNK> she receives an <UNK> to return home for a friend's wedding yep you guessed it return to milo who allegedly drowned years ago seems to be having a dilemma staying dead and begins <UNK> and murdering the girls he failed to examine all those years ago br br milo the character reminded me of one of the mutants from <UNK> the <UNK> he could have been scary but just how scary can a villain be who wears a yellow <UNK> the plot <UNK> even itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes back i'm sending milo an inept slasher film to stand in the corner
<START> the success of scream gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave i'm happy with that as a big fan of horror and i liked most of those new horror films is a one big pack of horror colorful fast paced and original i see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy much like episode 1 and aliens <UNK> since it comes up with a new twist instead of focusing on the little boy killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples we have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll sized lovers very inventive
<START> though often considered peter <UNK> worst film it is in fact an excellent send up of medical corporate corruption and <UNK> of power often misunderstood the film is actually a departure from the type of film sellers was best known for satirical farce this film had excellent performances by jo ann <UNK> and pat <UNK> of happy days and the karate kid movies but was marked by its <UNK> and total <UNK> <UNK> of the medical industry of the day it was ahead of its time 1972 in taking the outrageous path that the monty python crew would take into the cinema some time later as such it was <UNK> to the traditional peter sellers fan who found the more pointed <UNK> in this humor to be something to which they were <UNK> <UNK> peter sellers movies are in demand by fans but this effort where does it hurt has by its nature become almost impossible to find
<START> this film is an insult to the play upon which it is based the character of claude has been <UNK> beyond recognition leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot shame shame shame they have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the songs are sung this <UNK> the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how this should be to <UNK> as the writer of this screen play gives <UNK> a wife turns sheila into a spoiled rich girl <UNK> claude as a cowboy and kills <UNK> by sending him to vietnam instead if one is not familiar with the original plot i assure you this is not a bad film for you to see but if you ever wish to see the original or are as i am a die hard fan of the classic play you would do best to avoid the film altogether one really must stick to one or the other
<START> this movie have 4 parts and every is around <UNK> minutes long its based on true story of life of joe and it is telling all how he did see so in some events we can notice that we heard different about it movie make you tied up for chair till the end i think it is possible to watch all 4 in a row and not notice i watched 2 in a row and 2 next day in a row acting in movie is ok in some scenes awesome but in general could be but this movie is not about acting or special effects and <UNK> this one show real thing and story is key to this movie so the one who look for same spectacular rambo matrix titanic movie you can skip this one good thing in movie is that follow the main story so you will not have long and boring love scenes or any different <UNK> with something not important to crime business of
<START> anything park chan <UNK> creates is guaranteed to be unique brilliant and very twisted at a minimum well anything that isn't i'm a cyborg at least <UNK> <UNK> film titled <UNK> is a vampire romance erotic thriller dark comedy drama  yes that is a lot of <UNK>  inspired by the 19th century french novel by <UNK> <UNK> titled <UNK> park creates a uniquely korean and uniquely park vision of the vampire <UNK> and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a catholic priest discovering himself having a <UNK> for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like <UNK> or even that of lady vengeance heavily <UNK> with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience <UNK> desperately needed another trip through the cutting room it <UNK> when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely as negative as it may sound the <UNK> definitely <UNK> the <UNK> and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted <UNK> of park chan <UNK> film br br check out the rest of our review at www com
<START> this series when the <UNK> lived for <UNK> million years ago the <UNK> looks very real and are very realistic when they moves it is also very interesting how the climate changes br br i am very interesting in how the dinosaurs lived and died i am also interesting in how the dinosaurs <UNK> br br the color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discovered they think which color they had br br the most interesting is why the dinosaurs died and what happened after that br br bbc have made a brilliant series how the dinosaurs lived and died
<START> br br spoiler alert br br if you happen to like jurassic park 1 2 or 3 br br if you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality case in point john carpenter's dark star highly recommended br br if you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general br br then stay away from this cinematic <UNK> br br the shameless use of stock footage from <UNK> 1 2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a <UNK> slasher flick take the scene for instance where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the <UNK> t rex for some reason he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger why is that simply because this scene was lifted directly from <UNK> which was a crummy flick to begin with br br the ending was a <UNK> copy of <UNK> 2 for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight to video loser again we see mr rex do battle against a <UNK> which <UNK> as a <UNK> truck through the miracle of <UNK> stock footage from the aforementioned <UNK> 1 2 of course the ending is exactly the same the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames br br a real insult to anyone's intelligence br br but it's still better than watching the <UNK> <UNK> show br br rating 1 2 out of br br
<START> i think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of full scale review to merely because it's one of those viewer <UNK> complex <UNK> and philosophical movies that are brain wearing if while watching them you're trying to enjoy their shell and get to their core simultaneously yet there are several things which are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of art which i hope i am the first thing it's a certain masterpiece even of that kind of art which remains through a long long time the second it's one of those rare dark movies in which darkness is poetic even romantic attractive and much more sad than depressing like the art of or <UNK> david <UNK> as to the core of the movie someone called it though i don't agree with that because actually it's far beyond <UNK> <UNK> logic and much more like edgar <UNK> <UNK> dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls actually on the poetic side which is much more important than the narrative is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved only through eternal childhood of soul those who have such souls are usually <UNK> as crazy by our society but from another point of view they all have the virtue all the others lost when become grown the virtue of god's love indeed is a very christian movie be like children <UNK> 18 3 is it's real hidden tag line though the movie never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the christian philosophy for dare to suppose true god is beyond any human moral yet i think that is too harsh portraying grown people as a sort of demons trying to steal childhood from rare survived souls but it's his point of view and he has a right to think so while watching don't try to look for some hidden symbols though there are some better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior and do learn from them also i cannot mention that the movie looks astonishingly through excellent photography especially through rational use of color <UNK> incredibly <UNK> editing wonderful acting of all the cast and of course due to the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains that reminded me of the hunters in the snow also interestingly enough the scene with death in the form of an old woman with <UNK> black <UNK> eyes riding a <UNK> instantly reminded me of plague from the series of drawings by the norwegian painter <UNK> depicting how a black plague is sweeping out the population of a small town in the mountain valley is it a coincidence
<START> if i look hard enough flaws can be found in this film primarily with the script i found the character of wolf not totally convincing however those were my only complaints because when this movie started on cable i was just going to record it and watch it later however from the beginning with the eerie music and cameron diaz doing her <UNK> out 60's dance i was <UNK> i never got up until the movie was over it seemed like i never even <UNK> br br the acting of cameron diaz and <UNK> <UNK> was excellent the scenes were beautiful the girls were beautiful and the music was haunting and very touching the story was quite unique and at times had a surreal quality the viewer would tend to like the picture more if they had a good understanding of the state of mind of young people in the 60's and 70's especially in america many of the scenes basically succeeded in showing something of that era that is hard to pin down it was a bit more complicated than the simplistic statement that they wanted to change the world and ended up <UNK> although that may be the most obvious aspect <UNK> learns more and more about this as the movie progresses br br one aspect that didn't seem to be covered by the other reviewers that might bear mentioning is the way the two daughters seem to drift through life after the death of their father they both had <UNK> him and his presence had been a factor in their lives and obviously he had loved them <UNK> we read so much today about boys who lose their fathers too soon only to lose their way themselves this film covers the <UNK> effect of the loss of the father on the daughters left behind first on the older sister faith then on to her younger sister their mother feels <UNK> to try to be both parents this type of dynamic is not covered in hardly any other movies especially in so many different layers of plot and subplot inner struggles of reality versus <UNK> are gradually <UNK> away like layers of an <UNK> br br speaking of plot this movie should rate higher than it has here i kept waiting for some great conspiracy to be found out concerning the death of faith how it did resolve itself surprised me even if others may have guessed much sooner br br maybe not for everybody but i could watch this movie many many times
<START> what a wonderful documentary i sat down thinking this would be a rehash of the bitchy stories told in easy riders raging <UNK> but it is in fact a clear eyed glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that <UNK> some truly great movies what struck me was the lack of <UNK> apparent in the director interviews given that now the movie business sucks in a large fashion instead folk like <UNK> and <UNK> eyes seem to positively <UNK> <UNK> their glory days the footage of an audience coming out of a daytime screening of the exorcist was priceless <UNK> was traumatic ' one guy says a great <UNK> for the late ted <UNK> a thrilling film i just wish it was longer i could have sat through a three hour cut of this
<START> this <UNK> am adaptation <UNK> through the plot of <UNK> wonderful book replacing the emotional impact with <UNK> transitions and any exterior locations with drawings it's not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low of course but you have to question the point of making this in the first place when there's neither the time nor money to do it justice michael scrooge is far too gentle at the outset making his transformation lack power and this isn't helped along by a lack of reaction from him as he watches the visions the other actors range from acceptable clive paul to non <UNK> bernard lee to seeming like they're about to forget their lines john le <UNK> it doesn't even score points for effort to be honest
<START> <UNK> is basically a <UNK> together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into their in the <UNK> formula br br <UNK> down with unintentional humor the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of window at <UNK> speed to fire a <UNK> gun at a heat seeking missile following the flight path and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re <UNK> the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air many stars in this one including robert wagner sylvia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and martha <UNK> as a nervous passenger br br not really related to the other films
<START> i had seen in <UNK> and the new <UNK> so i thought i'd give this film a try br br at around 4 <UNK> i bought it at around <UNK> i started to watch at around 8 i fast <UNK> the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't at around 8 i threw the dvd into the <UNK> and that's where this film belongs br br what ever happened to british humour the humour so fine and witty intelligent and <UNK> that you find in yes minister <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> towers or the fast show the black humour britain is so famous for i don't want to insult anybody but i presume even stupid children wouldn't find this funny they deserve more intelligent fun and you can do better so please do
<START> turd pie br br take <UNK> <UNK> par <UNK> for 5 mins stir in mixed cardboard characters non actors work best add 2 tons of clichés then <UNK> in your plot hole <UNK> until bored serve with a <UNK> of <UNK> crack not a <UNK> br br <UNK> money spinning brain <UNK> for the <UNK> world of generation br br looking for the keys in drain was the best bit br br aside from the first 5 mins its one of the worst films ever made br br utter utter nonsense
<START> it's probably a year since i saw but it has left strong memories of the two main characters jaded photographer and his naive cousin from the village br br it's a long film with very little dialogue and a quite limited plot this has evidently annoyed a fair few viewers but the film <UNK> such a painfully believable portrait of and that there's just as much emotional tension as in the thriller br br just to be clear there's no padding in this film in the long pauses where no one speaks there as much happening in the characters' emotions and in yours watching them as you could bear go to see it awake and alert and you'll be <UNK> rather than br br rings true in so many ways and that sincerity is probably its greatest accomplishment people don't <UNK> with events and problems so much as with each other in fact in the whole film there's probably not one point where the main characters and ex wife are not opposed br br much of it is true the world over country cousin perhaps <UNK> naive expectation that a job on a ship will drop into his lap <UNK> cynicism and <UNK> to <UNK> with br br other truths are more specific to turkey that might be <UNK> his stay with <UNK> teeth <UNK> between macho ambition and wide eyed <UNK> when he tries to get to know a woman br br is undoubtedly a pretty bleak film and one strengths is not to beat us over the head with the themes he explores for me at least i believed entirely in the behaviour of his characters all the little failed attempts to connect and petty <UNK> ring so true and yet i didn't leave with a message that the world is like that but instead i got this is how we sometimes treat each other
<START> if you like really shocking movies this is for you the acting is the worst i've ever seen and the story line goes no where if you come across this film in your video shop don't even consider <UNK> it the chick on the front cover isn't even the one in the movie i gave this movie 1 10 only because i couldn't vote 0 avoid it at all costs
<START> a brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of its time and certainly far ahead of anything that was being released in mass production at the same point in history the influence of this work upon tim <UNK> nightmare before christmas is readily apparent one can only imagine how <UNK> over every beautifully detailed frame of this masterpiece br br there have been very few animated films of this caliber it's a shame that more people haven't seen this gem br br apparently imdb now requires comments to be at least ten lines long so this is the <UNK> line this must be something new but i really don't have anything else to say
<START> what often threatens to turn into a <UNK> and soft headed drama about misunderstood middle class youth ends up a surprisingly <UNK> and subdued movie by john <UNK> his first though he had started in television directing among other things an earlier version of this script br br we are still in those semi <UNK> when teenagers drove and <UNK> were still james macarthur <UNK> son of playwright charles and actress helen hayes and later to enter pop culture as hawaii 5 <UNK> gets involved in a minor incident in a movie theater which <UNK> to his throwing a punch at the manager <UNK> <UNK> and being <UNK> down at the police station his dad james <UNK> a big shot movie producer gets the call doesn't listen to his son's version of the story and pulls strings to get him off br br but macarthur keeps carrying a chip on his shoulder which even his sympathetic mom kim hunter can't knock off things <UNK> in the canyon <UNK> until macarthur trying to <UNK> himself stages a <UNK> of the original incident br br the movie doesn't quite avoid the attitudes  and cliches  of its time but presents them with considerable nuance every character gets an honorable hearing every point of view has its merits and reactions to the movie will depend on what viewers bring to it there are flaws the word crummy ' a standard rebellious <UNK> of the era is used about 30 times too often but they're <UNK> by strengths the movie benefits from a strong cast most notable among them the excellent character actor james gregory as a police detective and a <UNK> non exploitative way of telling its story from a <UNK> point in the new millennium the hot water macarthur finds himself in may seem a little tepid but the young stranger remains honest and honorable br br
<START> this movie will give me nightmares i will wake up <UNK> in sweat screaming i didn't make this film please don't blame me i honestly think it would have been more entertaining to watch a fat guy eating <UNK> in his <UNK> basement for a hour or two than to watch this crap i understand money was tight but <UNK> what the hell were they thinking there was no thought plot or effort put into this this movie needs a warning please for the love of god don't <UNK> the drama department a the local <UNK> on an other note these are the least likable characters i have ever seen and i have seen movies with hitler in them so lastly take my advice the next time you even think about renting this just pop a few hundred and let the sleep come
<START> i have nothing at all against paul <UNK> in fact hardcore 1979 is one of my very favorite films but some horror movie fans were in a <UNK> <UNK> when his original version of the exorcist prequel <UNK> this one you're reading about right now as it turns out was <UNK> by <UNK> and when <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> to <UNK> things up and make a new version that was more scary in my opinion some viewers were <UNK> and became automatically up for hating <UNK> <UNK> take on the subject exorcist the beginning before the first frame of film was ever even for them to judge and i ought to know because i myself went into the theatrical premiere of beginning with stubborn arms <UNK> and prepared for the absolute worst which i was sure had to come imagine my surprise when i found <UNK> beginning to be much more serious than i ever could have conceived with a good performance from <UNK> as a young version of father who was struggling with his faith in god it wasn't a great film by any means but it was nowhere near the garbage i had prepared myself for well in advance sight unseen br br well now i finally have seen the true garbage version and it's paul <UNK> <UNK> prequel to the exorcist it was relentlessly talky uninteresting and insipid <UNK> troubled priest was nowhere near as interesting as he had been for me in <UNK> film and the actor himself not as good in the part for all those who pointed out the obvious cgi effects in beginning guess what they're here in <UNK> as well remember the silly ending in <UNK> rendition which i'll also agree <UNK> the rest of that movie well you're going to find that this ending from <UNK> isn't a hell of a lot less lame br br let me also say that i <UNK> the nonsense that's been presented by those who appreciate this film better than <UNK> by saying that we're <UNK> or cannot appreciate subtle film making as a person who <UNK> stephen mtv fashioned mummy of <UNK> and being a true fan of the very suggestive and <UNK> old horror films of the <UNK> and <UNK> i can assure you this is not the case with me at least there was some degree of terror and exorcist type goings on in <UNK> beginning this one here is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge even for the most <UNK> of <UNK> it's going to be quite interesting to hear horror fans try to convince themselves that <UNK> prequel to the exorcist was as good as they'd already made their minds up for it to be in advance just as they were already pre <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> beginning the second they learned paul <UNK> name was getting <UNK> with the white out
