<START> la an <UNK> film by <UNK> director <UNK> succeeds both as a <UNK> of the silent movie genre and a gripping <UNK> tale the setting is a city in <UNK> to mindless television its people <UNK> of the power of speech except for a <UNK> and mysterious screen presence known simply as the voice in a <UNK> to <UNK> their grip on power the <UNK> villainous duo of television <UNK> mr tv and mad scientist dr y set out to kidnap the voice and turn her unique talent towards their own <UNK> ends it is up to a young family and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> son to stop this evil scheme the result is a roller coaster of a story that is <UNK> on occasion but never less than engrossing br br this is a silent movie that wears many of its influences on its <UNK> the overt references to silent movie <UNK> such as george <UNK> and fritz lang will be readily apparent to anyone with a passing <UNK> of their work but more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such <UNK> i particularly like the fact that mr tv and his henchman drive around in typical 1930s gangster cars drawn from the decade when the silent movie era died away and a very different industry began to emerge br br la mines the clichéd plot devices and theatrical over acting common to so many silent films albeit in a very knowing and humorous way it is the astonishing visual style of la that really sets it apart from the movies that it pays homage to from the hypnotic tv <UNK> to the menacing <UNK> <UNK> station this film <UNK> with dazzling visual <UNK> that is the rival of a studio <UNK> animation  and all this using real actors and <UNK> sets br br moreover though the style is often intentionally corny and theatrical this is still an unsettling provocative and emotional picture the use of religious symbolism throughout la lends added <UNK> to the struggle between the tv empire and the <UNK> power of words at the same time many of the most powerful images are original ones including the hypnotic <UNK> of the television sets and the nightmarish tv food factory br br i hate to end this review on a sour note but i feel that the english language release of la is let down by the subtitles the original spanish subtitles are used to great effect with much playing around with words on screen however the english language subtitles that <UNK> the original dialogue are <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and mistakes at times leaving the viewer to piece things together for themselves la is nevertheless a striking piece of cinema a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humour whilst <UNK> a powerful <UNK> tale
<START> for a horror film this is criminally dull a few memorable gruesome bits can't compensate for a really poor script very little <UNK> is achieved and the movie relentlessly <UNK> its one basic idea a killer cat until it becomes repetitive and things are made even worse by the constant use of shots from the <UNK> point of view 1 2
<START> camp blood br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 <UNK> view 3 d br br sound format <UNK> br br whilst <UNK> in <UNK> near the deserted camp <UNK> site of an <UNK> murder ten years earlier four young city <UNK> are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills their guide <UNK> harris and stalks them through the woods with murderous intent br br low rent time <UNK> filmed on camcorder <UNK> the <UNK> view field <UNK> 3 d format there's a plot at least but the script <UNK> closely to an established <UNK> with obvious <UNK> to the likes of friday the 13th the burning and the texas chain saw massacre without adding anything even remotely new or interesting to the formula director brad sykes also responsible for similar 3 d efforts like the zombie chronicles 2001 and bloody <UNK> 2002 <UNK> the early works of george a romero and sam <UNK> as key influences on his career but while those filmmakers challenged the mainstream with their no budget efforts sykes uses video technology merely to imitate his cinematic heroes resulting in a home movie with <UNK> of <UNK> aside from the 3 d format there is nothing here to warrant anyone's attention followed by camp blood 2 2000
<START> a single mom her son and daughter and their hippie chick friend are camping in the woods a muscle bound <UNK> wielding maniac in a yellow <UNK> mask appears he starts <UNK> and sexually <UNK> the family before murdering them with a <UNK> wet wilderness is loaded with ugly hardcore sex forced incest and blatant racism it's as politically incorrect as <UNK> get the score is stolen from <UNK> hitchcock's horror classic psycho and also jaws the acting is hilariously awful the editing is bad and there are some huge <UNK> in logic the repetitive nature of the sex scenes <UNK> the movie after while so the brief running time is a <UNK> the scenes of violence are quite nasty for example the hippie girl is stabbed with the <UNK> in her <UNK> and one can see blood on her <UNK> 3 out of 10 and that's being generous
<START> the actors actresses on this series are ok but the scripts have been absolutely horrible this family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny in fact the scripts illustrate very often how not to be a parent the scripts are so bad they make homer simpson look like a better father than this one br br anyone who is becoming a parent if you want to see what not to do with your kids this show is the perfect guide i think the garbage this show <UNK> us is beyond words br br michael <UNK> has seen much better material in his career including his role in <UNK> they need a strong lead in better much better scripts than what i have seen to this point br br if you think this is <UNK> my teenager even turned off one show of this because they thought it was horrible
<START> this movie is really bad most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement there's a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg there are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap <UNK> puppets with cardboard teeth and the plot is a bunch of post apocalyptic <UNK> <UNK> that makes no sense at all the whole thing is just laughable
<START> the horror of this made for tv film was that it didn't end with this one it <UNK> a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot movie most films about various <UNK> have some type of realism to them and of course are <UNK> up to make it exciting this had none of that if the intent was to make in camp then it succeeded it <UNK> on cable a couple of years ago and failed again richard performance as the master chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film <UNK> than the batman series of the 60's
<START> let's not beat about the bush here taylor undoubtedly slick movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre other than jamie <UNK> exceptional career making performance remember the year they handed the special effects oscar to the terminator 2 <UNK> they should do the same with this year's best actor <UNK> br br that ray <UNK> story is worthy of filming is not in <UNK> indeed the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are well handled and used but for a life so unique the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar it follows the of a flawed <UNK> <UNK> almost to the letter <UNK> and exploitation women and drugs recording <UNK> band <UNK> <UNK> yeah yeah yeah and surely there was more humour in his life than we're treated to here br br i appreciate <UNK> music yet where neatly cut would have kept the story rolling <UNK> himself with near full length <UNK> of too many songs in <UNK> <UNK> in the recording studio in concert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and for non <UNK> they begin to act like a cinematic <UNK> this may seem like harsh judgement on a music biopic but with a <UNK> as extensive as <UNK> we need a taste not the whole dish otherwise we'd buy the albums br br intrigued as i was i <UNK> at my watch more than once so for all <UNK> brilliance maybe ray would have been better served as an hbo two <UNK>
<START> i didn't know anything about this dvd when i hired it had a quick look here at the comments but decided to keep an open mind obviously an independent film and low budget but that didn't worry me i will watch anything with <UNK> and as always he played his part well what a pity no one else did i had watched a few weeks ago with vanessa redgrave and she was sublime in this she seemed to just turn up to read the lines in my opinion the main mistake was in casting <UNK> jones to be honest i saw his picture on the dvd cover but didn't notice that he got top billing a <UNK> was <UNK> placed over his name it was watchable and i quite liked the dickens story alongside present day maybe with a more capable actor playing the lead this might have worked better still it was weak
<START> ah yet another seagal movie in no less than a few mere months arrive to <UNK> the video store shelves as bad as <UNK> no but that is not saying much like <UNK> on a pig br br seagal is professional thief who wants to quit but goes for one last job only to be double crossed by his boss he lands in prison and is <UNK> by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek <UNK> br br its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent cop or what he usually plays we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems then an eastern european territory as usual there is no wire fu either here don does an okay job br br however most of the action and fight scenes with <UNK> are clearly <UNK> scenes from other movies a lack of realism and logic in even <UNK> situation seagal and make a so so team inspiring unintentional laughs one minute <UNK> the rest br br several notable faces turn up to <UNK> it sleepy kevin <UNK> is a long way from his <UNK> days nick <UNK> shows up in <UNK> mode to take a check no more <UNK> please br br at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled <UNK> more than ever its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up he should have gotten out a while ago
<START> river <UNK> sound <UNK> should have been fired in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set <UNK> voices was the end result and the cinematography was average to fair at best the story had potential and i feel sorry for the overseas actors who must have known they were on a turkey shoot while they were filming its obvious that the movie was suffering from el <UNK> budget syndrome and the scene where is <UNK> inside the house while a battle <UNK> outside is just too stupid for words br br i noticed a few <UNK> taken on the <UNK> side of things but this was probably due to movie length time <UNK> etc all in all i wasn't impressed with this movie the river has many beautiful spots but this movie gives us a cold drab and claustrophobic image with none of the beauty the movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles less on screen confusion better sound recording and more thought needed to be put into what the movie goers would be seeing on the big screen br br hats off to all involved though for <UNK> what must have been a very difficult <UNK> i have the <UNK> appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film sadly i did not enjoy this one
<START> a good story well acted with unexpected character twists <UNK> vicious murderous gangster bryan brown teaching his son although it succeeds as an action drama where you hope the good guy ledger and his succeed it also has some hilarious ironic black humour <UNK> the bank robbers who become radio competition winners and their reaction the revenge etc well worth watching
<START> <UNK> yep poorly filmed you <UNK> zero budget they proudly claim it on their posters brilliant anyway or because of it for sure br br this movie <UNK> and makes fun of everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre characters with absolutely no depth fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment teenagers trying to survive a <UNK> by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something <UNK> adolescent completely gratuitous nudity impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims slow moving zombies great one liners and our hero even wears a michael jackson jacket br br this is not an all out spoof like scary movie but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies when being scared and <UNK> out could also be a fun silly sexy and goofy good time
<START> <UNK> is certainly one of tobe <UNK> best films it has some great special effects and a lot of nudity so it seems like a typical horror <UNK> dream the film is quit creative though and i think that's because of the script from dan and don nice cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film
<START> this movie is dated in so many ways it's sensational you can either laugh at it or shake your <UNK> in rage br br this movie deals with many problems of american history but with the typical white male christian american <UNK> the main character is one of those i can do it all and you've got to love me for it kind of guy he is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time what a horrid creature his wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very <UNK> but stronger character in the end too bad she still <UNK> his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time it's just sad that the character didn't really change at all even though she is supposed to portray a strong and independent woman in the end she is consumed by worry about her adventure seeking husband so 2 out of 10 points from the <UNK> among us and those are only for the good intentions the problem of indian <UNK> is dealt with quite nicely but there is that <UNK> story telling again and the fact that all african american characters are the typical stereotypes makes the movie even more <UNK> i was so <UNK> most of the time so one point for trying from the civil rights movement br br i know that the movie was done at a different time i love old movies and i have a lot of patience with some of those dated point of views but this was just disgusting br br what saves this movie are the parts without the main character mr <UNK> acting is way over the top and smug maybe that's why his character is so <UNK> i liked mrs <UNK> performance even though her character <UNK> me at times br br but i must say the famous land rush scene was incredibly done and the way that the <UNK> <UNK> was portrayed made the movie worthwhile it's just amazing how civilization rose out of the dirt and dust of the 19th century and i don't understand the problem some have with that church scene i thought it was quite funny and amusing maybe it wasn't supposed to be but i liked it so 9 points for those scenes and the impressive storytelling of the development of the <UNK> state that makes about 4 points altogether
<START> after spending half an hour <UNK> rumors a gay bar located outside <UNK> small town gay bar shifts focus to the murder of <UNK> weaver in bay <UNK> in order to demonstrate the risks run by the interview subjects but there is a problem here bay <UNK> isn't near as the film implies it isn't even in the same state it is actually about three hundred miles away in <UNK> <UNK> br br director <UNK> <UNK> doesn't exactly rush to point out this fact nor does he bother to mention that while bay <UNK> itself is little more than a wide spot in the road it is actually about two deep <UNK> away from the major <UNK> area of mobile <UNK> which has a noticeable gay community quite a few gay bars and even a <UNK> of <UNK> community church if <UNK> is <UNK> on these points one has to ask if he is on others as well br br speaking as someone who was born raised and continues to live in <UNK> i have to say that i find most of small town gay bar a lot of <UNK> neither <UNK> nor the <UNK> upon which <UNK> focuses are as rural small or as isolated as he would have you imagine and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies that said <UNK> rather <UNK> ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community and in doing so he demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture which tends to hold those who frequent bars be they gay or straight in low <UNK> br br small town gay bar is in my opinion an instance in which a film maker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then <UNK> to film the agenda do gays and lesbians living in rural <UNK> face major sometimes frightening challenges you bet they do but that's no excuse for <UNK> with reality to such a degree the dvd includes a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes but i found the feature film itself so ridiculous that i didn't waste any time on them br br <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> the idea that anyone could of <UNK> such a trite cliché yet comical movie is shocking the final 20 minutes of this film are comical glory with six men digging enough <UNK> in 10 minutes to light the <UNK> with <UNK> for a <UNK> while a supposed perfectly lands the <UNK> in a leading one to question the <UNK> of calling this movie crash landing br br some of the dialogue was equivalent to <UNK> <UNK> in my ears while the only aspect that saved this movie for a 1 was the <UNK> of attractive women filling the screen a large portion of the time not exactly a for this pathetic excuse of a movie but my mute button finally received a <UNK> br br view at your own risk 2 out of 10
<START> as main character <UNK> silver likes to point out you know f k all about vampires it is evident that this statement was aimed at the cast and crew who create an exceedingly bad image of everyone's favourite <UNK> undead according to the misguided director vampires are all <UNK> in white foundation and <UNK> into <UNK> similar to a piece of meat in shrink wrap with <UNK> resembling and a bad case of <UNK> our main character <UNK> creates a slapstick caricature of the modern day vampire br br the plot consists of a 9 year old <UNK> <UNK> collection <UNK> down on a piece of paper then <UNK> together to <UNK> this horrible tale <UNK> our pale protagonist is a vampire bounty hunter who makes a living from out members of everyone's favourite cult the rather than <UNK> the classic assassin <UNK> of stealth and <UNK> however <UNK> <UNK> in through an open window and then proceeds to <UNK> her targets <UNK> before shooting them point blank with a <UNK> that apparently doesn't leave bullet holes thanks to the shoddy continuity pc <UNK> is then assigned to solve the murders he comes to the <UNK> yet strikingly obvious conclusion that <UNK> is actually a vampire and proceeds to hunt her down armed with the usual vampire <UNK> tools including a cross <UNK> and a <UNK> piece of wood meanwhile <UNK> who has gotten into the habit of her boss is <UNK> when an old nemesis him and demands a <UNK> to be delivered personally as you may imagine this doesn't go according to plan i'm not going to put myself through the pain of the following scenes however so i'll skip to the end <UNK> and her nemesis have a showdown and after <UNK> <UNK> victory it is then revealed with all the <UNK> of someone being told they have cancer that the two are century old lovers and the whole plot was some kind of twisted game yes that kick in the balls was the actual ending of the film in my eyes this joke of a conclusion is the <UNK> on the <UNK> clad cake and <UNK> this film in the never ever watch this vault br br as far as cinematic techniques go the film merely doesn't bother creating any style the director tries to rescue his <UNK> from the brink by throwing in some close ups and a few multi <UNK> shots this however is not the saving grace the film needed br br you may be screaming but this is a b movie its meant to be crap i however do not take pity i have seen some cracking b movies such as evil dead 2 and jesus christ vampire hunter and therefore this disgrace cannot hide behind excuses the budget was low this is obvious by the lack of location and good actors maybe however if the director was more creative and spent less money on paying for makeup and fake blood he could have done something decent with this sickening attempt the seedy sex scenes are not <UNK> in any way and merely served to give me a few chuckles at the obscene acting skills throughout half the budget must have been paid to the female cast merely for getting their tops off for lesbian <UNK> if i wanted to watch a vampire porno i would have bought the vampire <UNK> br br the cast are bad the story is worse and the effects are <UNK> fake this film had some potential however its seedy <UNK> and embarrassing portrayal of a classic horror character merely served to be its downfall br br if you want a laugh with a few friends i recommend you watch this mockery if you are looking for a more serious vampire action flick try blade or underworld to your raging <UNK>
<START> destined to be a classic before it was even <UNK> this game deserves all the recognition it deserves at a time when first person <UNK> like <UNK> iii <UNK> and unreal <UNK> are <UNK> all the attention of computer <UNK> graphic adventures are a dying breed with great pun and humour the curse of monkey island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy life can only improve after playing the curse of monkey island <UNK> the sequel escape from monkey island is already destined to be a classic too i guarantee it
<START> another sequel why on earth do they keep making these this has got to be the weakest ever yet it is still being <UNK> and <UNK> sequels scarecrow gone wild which i only watched so i could officially trash the whole series brings back the evil straw man who again <UNK> up some college kids that's basically it the acting sucks as usual the death scenes are beyond pathetic and don't be fooled by the title this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think a couple nice topless girls but nothing too pants <UNK> let me just conclude my continuous insult or review on this movie by saying if i come across a scarecrow in space or a freddy vs scarecrow on the video store shelves i'm going to be in absolute awe
<START> this is a classic american movie in combination with comedy romance dream you may say ' there have been lots of these kind of films already but just believe me you'll find this a good one because it's well directed scripted and played amanda just <UNK> amazing she's humor cute charming both inside outside the screen she's the man indeed the message i get from it is to pursue your own fairy tale what i mean <UNK> is not the one with prince princess but <UNK> namely it tells us to hold your faith dream things that make you regret for your whole life if you don't do that one of those movies you can't miss out in your life
<START> acclaimed <UNK> horror director <UNK> directs a script from jack curtis and antonio ross cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method to the madness a doctor's son is <UNK> his early death until his desperate father <UNK> an heart into his chest as expected things are going to get weird when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> out nice looking party girls to make his slaves when heroin is <UNK> his <UNK> become zombies the monster <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> with strange <UNK> music so bad well it's just bad in the cast jose e <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> gloria <UNK> and gina
<START> the 1990s was a great decade for british sitcom with many popular creations such as one foot in the grave absolutely the thin blue line the empire and men behaving badly arriving onto tv screens for the first time br br however mr bean is hands down the greatest sitcom of the 1990s br br mr bean represents the first major attempt at a <UNK> to the era of silent <UNK> such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton for several decades it brings to the audience a single character mr bean played to perfection by <UNK> <UNK> br br many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other <UNK> have engaged in <UNK> about whether or not mr bean has a mental <UNK> or has significant learning difficulties <UNK> from such a <UNK> however i believe this debate is unnecessary because i highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider mr bean in such a context br br mr bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no <UNK> from others some of his methods to approaching day to day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show this is where the humour <UNK> from mr bean is not necessarily someone with a mental <UNK> he may just be an eccentric person <UNK> to dealing with things his own way and naturally some of his methods to <UNK> a single task often result in disaster which we then see mr bean try to resolve br br sometimes we see mr bean show a mean or petty streak often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it but no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and <UNK> are always <UNK> br br unlike most examples of british comedy in the past 30 years mr bean is simple <UNK> harmless u rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy it is for this reason why the tv series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world it is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other tv shows will have come gone and been forgotten br br some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet i laugh just as much at mr <UNK> antics now as i did when i first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s <UNK> <UNK> has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time br br the tv series has to date <UNK> two spin off movies bean and mr <UNK> holiday as one familiar with the type of humour shown in the tv series would expect it does not translate to success on the big screen the two movies do little justice to the tv series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes the greatest failing in both movies perhaps <UNK> in the change of setting in both movies the producers take mr bean out of his normal british surroundings into america the first movie and france the second movie as a result the movie characters around mr bean respond differently to his behaviour than their tv series counterparts both movies re use gags from the tv series and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time in the second movie mr bean is shown to be behaving out of character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny at various times i found myself thinking that the character i was watching was not mr bean but a pale caricature it is clear that <UNK> <UNK> was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the tv series his heart just wasn't in the performance after the second movie came out he stated <UNK> that he would not play mr bean again i realise how he felt br br returning to the tv series each episode shows evidence of <UNK> planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies br br my favourite episodes are the first three these set the high standard that was to continue i consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless br br to <UNK> mr bean is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family <UNK> <UNK> is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this tv series my recommendation watch and enjoy but only see the movies if you consider yourself a die hard fan after seeing the tv series
<START> when i read the synopsis for <UNK> in the television guide i was not prepared for what was in store the story follows <UNK> trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across london he soon realises a pattern there is a serial killer on the loose killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 <UNK> and their killings are identical to their matching <UNK> the two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat with <UNK> closely pursuing the killer but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill <UNK> victim <UNK> is sure to cause a great deal of controversy but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the bbc has shown in a long time
<START> hitchcock would be proud of this movie even when nothing happens it is suspenseful director david lynch a few cheap thrill tricks here and there but he <UNK> them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming <UNK> br br altogether surreal this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible i am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things i missed and which may help me understand it better it is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together so you must be patient and pay attention get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts and yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme the mood the character development and the filming techniques br br the <UNK> roles of the main actress <UNK> <UNK> showcase her enormous talent that is when i could get my eyes off of her co star what an acting pair br br lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles the length timing of editing cuts jumping back and forth between scenes combined with smart use of music and sounds it all helps to build suspense in our minds <UNK> a major objective of the director well he kept me on the edge of my seat even had me talking to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there you know the kind of stuff you want to <UNK> your kids for doing at the movies
<START> i don't get it the teenage leads in horror star supposedly all are devoted horror fans yet when their favorite idol conrad passes away they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of <UNK> stuff with it like disco dancing it around the house and throw food <UNK> at it that doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do now does it i'm a big horror fan and i immensely <UNK> <UNK> icons like vincent price peter cushing and boris karloff but it would never come to my mind to <UNK> their memory no wonder conrad comes back from the dead  admittedly after a <UNK>  to wipe them all off the face of the earth mr already wasn't known for his <UNK> in life since he occasionally killed the directors that <UNK> with his visions and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego even inside his tomb there are video messages to possible <UNK> and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets horror star a k a and body <UNK> is a pretty lame 80's horror flick but there are a handful of cheesy gory highlights to enjoy the film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot since no one  not even a film school student  is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he'll get away with it and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through <UNK> video speeches from beyond the grave are overly <UNK> and definitely <UNK> the tension but on the other hand his killing methods are <UNK> inventive one teenager enjoys the experience of getting <UNK> alive and another one jeffrey combs in one of his first roles loses his head in a delightful <UNK> sequence in the absolute <UNK> sequence a poor <UNK> head is crushed by a coffin writer director norman <UNK> <UNK> wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister the locations and scenery are great but <UNK> lacked the necessary <UNK> to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing job the acting performances are overall decent with <UNK> <UNK> imitating christopher lee and jeffrey combs delivering the most memorable roles horror star can hardly be called a must see or even a good film but it's worth tracking down in case you're an admirer of <UNK> made b horror
<START> this movie looked fun on the cover and i honestly thought <UNK> bad can this be ' little did i know out of the gate the dialogue was unbearable it was contrived unrealistic and not even interesting dialogue on <UNK> <UNK> television shows is more natural sounding the story was implausible and had nearly zero play off at the end the end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged the only remotely interesting character is rose who is mute which <UNK> her from being ruined with cliche ridden garbage dialogue well at least until the end when even she has to speak the only thing that even gives this a 3 over a 1 or 2 is rose nude scene truly awful save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting like a barney video
<START> there are no flaws in this production perfectly entertaining fun and worthy of respect br br this is what theatre is all about definitely not for the very young but slightly older kids will get a great kick out of seeing it and can be introduced to theatre this way br br astounding and amazing
<START> this episode so far is the best of the series the story was told perfectly i especially liked how the writers made it a <UNK> episode it was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the emmy for his performance br br we had some of our questions answered in this episode but since the show is called lost we know there will be more questions brought up too first the answered walt is reunited finally with his father michael second michael's betrayal is exposed to jack <UNK> kate and and because of this betrayal kate jack and <UNK> are all taken captive by the others this was a great way to end the show br br on the other side of the island we see locke going through a mental breakdown with the button this leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down however there are some unanswered questions first what happened to locke <UNK> and <UNK> when <UNK> turned the key and what was the deal with the scientists in the <UNK> searching for <UNK> guess we'll find out next season however great ending to the best show on tv
<START> the movie starts off relatively well and seems to be getting somewhere when an african american passenger an <UNK> for <UNK> there is one scene in which his pet dog gets sucked into the engine and thats really a sad thing but the way it is portrayed makes it difficult for one to figure out if that was an attempt at crude humor or really a tragedy to reflect on the extent of <UNK> after this point they clearly ran out of ideas if you stuck around long enough you will soon be treated with one of the worst movies ever made it is basically a highly racist sequence of smoking <UNK> toilet humor <UNK> of each and every segment of the aircraft to reflect african american pop culture and pretty much nothing else you'd think that the only 3 white passengers <UNK> would lead to some hilarious consequences but nothing of the same happens they were basically just added to show how badly they could initially be treated and later be accepted into the hood if they <UNK> avoid
<START> <UNK> <UNK> in blue is a slow moving b flick in which blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes <UNK> in a murder investigation a mediocre film at best <UNK> in b features some members of the band chicago a <UNK> of action some <UNK> and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler not worth the time
<START> since the last horrid film and the fact that we only get the swiss german version in cinemas here i went to watch it with quite a bit of <UNK> <UNK> as i was happy to discover br br the film is funny and modern has good gags a good animation an amusing character interaction a good voice cast note i can only speak for the swiss german one except for the <UNK> <UNK> daughter <UNK> her name is great despite the not very inspired voice actress br br i especially liked the character in french in german he's the young man who is supposed to be put in shape he's a very amusing portrayal of a urban teenager but he's very likable despite the teenage mannerisms <UNK> the interaction between and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining br br it shouldn't be compared to the old films since this one is quite different which surprisingly doesn't make it bad on the contrary when they tried to <UNK> the last film twelve years ago they completely blew it this film however proved that it can be done just fine br br i came out of the theater cheerful always a good sign
<START> as over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is <UNK> with so called sitcoms actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable king of queens is a very original unique and <UNK> funny <UNK> it's about the daily life of a and his wife who works as an <UNK> assistant in manhattan in queens ny with them lives <UNK> father arthur a picture book <UNK> who is played by the fantastic jerry stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears other important people are their best friends <UNK> and kelly a married couple and their other friend <UNK> who's almost 30 and still lives with his mother what makes this show so unique and funny is above all that every single character seems so real and <UNK> cynical sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of good natured slightly dumb optimism and <UNK> the one who makes it absolutely unpredictable with his strange ideas and <UNK> he often gets himself into trouble and doug and carrie have to drag him out of the mud even if in my opinion the quality of the show <UNK> a little within the last years it's still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made it takes a little time to get into the characters and relate to them but after that's done you get some <UNK> laughs from it although i think i couldn't survive one day with arthur in a closed room without beating the guts out of him i really adore him in this show watch and have fun i give it a 9 out of 10
<START> i took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and it <UNK> to us all i agree with the other post the wilson guy worked a <UNK> script into a great minor character it is good to have a movie for a certain age <UNK> too old for pg too young for r it also shows how they think and <UNK> in junior high school you had to love how well jimmy <UNK> did as the cool teacher he kept us adults awake the level of kids questioning authority was kept reasonable their motives were specific and not like some a d d rebel the setting and music were beautiful overall if you enjoyed holes this is really similar
<START> <UNK> is a wonderful thing much <UNK> when it first appeared inspiring the famous review <UNK> no this <UNK> of <UNK> can now be looked at in comparison and it's not half bad it's certainly no classic but it has its own <UNK> charm the film version of <UNK> follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat one should of course resist the temptation to <UNK> when laurence <UNK> christopher it keeps the original author's real name god knows what thought of it describes himself as 'a confirmed and while harvey is an utterly <UNK> <UNK> he's virtually <UNK> and <UNK> winters woefully miscast as <UNK> the part marisa played in <UNK> julie harris is a perfectly marvellous sally it's a lovely piece of comic acting and anton <UNK> is first rate as fritz the german jew in love with <UNK> character of course if <UNK> had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again that it has been <UNK> may not quite be cause for celebration but it's perfectly acceptable all the same
<START> it's really rather simple the name of the movie is death bed the bed that eats if you are anything like me you already know if you are going to like this movie i stumbled across this gem at best buy the other day and picked it up for ten bucks i got ten bucks worth of enjoyment out of the title and the box alone br br i'm a huge fan of b movies this is in my opinion one of the greatest b movies i've ever seen now it's not for every one br br granted it's not even for most people as a matter of fact i suspect their are only going to be a handful of us who truly enjoy this movie br br for those of you who like b movies though this film is a diamond in the rough it has a great premise a bed that people it doesn't walk it doesn't move it doesn't have a <UNK> call to attract people it pretty much relies on people wandering by and sitting on it br br i loved every inch of this movie and have already seen it three times in the <UNK> weeks i've owned it br br like i said after reading the title of the film you already know if you'll like it if you laughed or <UNK> then give it a go it's worth it
<START> the basic idea for this movie was good but there was no real character development and the pacing was slow maybe because i saw it in a <UNK> edited pan <UNK> video version it went straight to video in france
<START> i usually really enjoy steven seagal movies they are usually highly entertaining and being somewhat of an <UNK> of <UNK> i usually like the way steven <UNK> these martial art techniques in the fight sequences br br however this film is a really bad movie making effort and it seems obvious to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie let alone direct someone like steven seagal and to take advantage of his knowledge and <UNK> br br i never saw the end of this movie i walked out before the end simply because i couldn't stand watching anymore of this bad movie i am sure that many people also share my feelings
<START> oh dear this sequel has a mirror this time which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath which murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the <UNK> home the mirror captured the entire ugly incident of the horrified family who had no time to prepare for their <UNK> guest the mirror is given to a photographer <UNK> ross <UNK> by a bum who just so happens to be his lunatic father and the man responsible for killing the family and it's evil soon <UNK> those in a <UNK> such as painter pal <UNK> portrayed by julia <UNK> soul where he lives when they look into it soon <UNK> is having nightmares looking through the eyes of his father as he guns down the family in cold blood worried that he might follow in his footsteps soon he sees other <UNK> through his father's eyes like that terrible day pops <UNK> his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell as doctor's <UNK> a drug to <UNK> him br br pretty solid supporting cast who deserve better than being stuck in junk like this such as david <UNK> american werewolf in london as the <UNK> of the <UNK> with which <UNK> lives richard <UNK> as an eccentric <UNK> artist terry <UNK> as a psychologist detective and especially lin <UNK> as a hilarious <UNK> rather strange secretary nurse in the asylum the one which held father soon to be closed down br br <UNK> out the film the sexy <UNK> <UNK> as supportive girlfriend barbara howard friday the 13th the final chapter as <UNK> betrayed wife he was on the verge of starting an affair with soul jack as the sadistic fiend who attempts to <UNK> his son into killing innocent people as he did and robert a nightmare on elm street 2 freddy's revenge as a rejected lover of <UNK> soul who meets an unfortunate demise while ripping apart paintings as a revenge for his <UNK> br br this film is a poor special effects movie merely using the <UNK> title as a cash in the franchise has never been that great to begin with but as each sequel was green lit it grew worse and worse after the third film furniture from the infamous house become possessed items <UNK> folks the cast try hard though but the material a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means is lacking in quality and the rather mediocre special effects don't help matters <UNK> as little as he has to work with shows why he's such a great actor he can even shine in <UNK> such as this <UNK> not lost you get to see always wearing super short <UNK> or her man's shirt in <UNK> showing off her legs throughout hey you have to find a silver <UNK> somewhere believe it or not <UNK> a new generation was the seventh film in the franchise coolest part of the film were the <UNK> of demons painted by <UNK> artist perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking into it
<START> i didn't know a lot about this film going into it but i did find out that kane was a wrestler which didn't exactly thrill me but hey i liked <UNK> <UNK> and that had a wrestler in it so what the hell the story begins very strangely and <UNK> but after a while becomes not much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick although the settings helped some a bunch of criminal young folks get rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter the driver is a man with a <UNK> arm being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie <UNK> he encounters this big <UNK> that had just killed his partner and <UNK> another woman the teens all being punk smart <UNK> all of course object to having to do any real work but they're part of some unique co ed work program yep what a great idea that is of course little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking there in the hotel that in his own little way will save the tax <UNK> of that state some money of course it's the guy that likes to collect <UNK> and he's got quite a collection going there won't be a lot here that horror fans haven't seen before but there's a few brutal scenes and sufficient gore to satisfy the hard core fan the setting of the old hotel makes a perfect spot for a slasher flick too and there's little sub stories like the search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes since this co ed work crew is <UNK> matched most of the teens are <UNK> too so that works well not great but far better than silent hill or when a stranger calls and perhaps better than some of the other crap that i wouldn't bother to see 7 out of 10
<START> i remember ignoring the tv series when it first <UNK> because of its <UNK> with the jim muppets however recently a friend let me borrow his <UNK> dvds and i am just now realizing what a terrible mistake that was br br as with any tv series there are episodes that shine and those that don't i ride the <UNK> and emotional rush during the great episodes and suffer through the lackluster ones however i endure regardless because of the core storyline that ties all the episodes together what i'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other let me warn you it is something that is absolutely irresistible to watch i cannot recall any other tv series <UNK> 5 buffy angel etc that <UNK> and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking at times and suspenseful ride br br i think that at the end of the fourth season things were finally becoming tightly focused and i am shocked at the decision to <UNK> the series i wait <UNK> for the release of the miniseries and invite others to discover this incredible gem
<START> oh my lord what were they thinking about with this one it not only is <UNK> unfunny but worse a very good original was <UNK> in the bargain jane fonda believe it or not actually turned in the performance of her life in that one even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life maybe she is just flat good as a crook any other time wow what a waste of time but she and segal team up beautifully so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby catch the <UNK> upon which it got beaten into a pulp from br br because very very very little of that one remains to this ones horror nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when dick and jane are <UNK> <UNK> up as <UNK> and cant kiss and <UNK> oh my lord that's it well looks like it br br it truly is that bad a film
<START> unfortunately many great films on imdb such as this one have their scores <UNK> by imdb this is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of bonnie and clyde little big man night moves mickey one and the chase br br if you click in the user rating area you'll see that the actual <UNK> for four friends is 7 6 however imdb has <UNK> <UNK> down the rating to 6 4 br br per imdb imdb <UNK> vote <UNK> rather than raw data <UNK> various <UNK> are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and <UNK> attempts at by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it the exact methods we use will not be <UNK> this should ensure that the policy remains effective in other words we won't <UNK> our methods so you can't question how we arrived at the score what a shame to see fine thought provoking films like four friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to <UNK> <UNK>
<START> where do we start with an offering like this i nearly said film but that would be going a step too far the only thing <UNK> about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell between nothing and nonsense <UNK> and these films should carry a <UNK> health warning so as not to damage one's spirit to the point where one might believe that all good film makers have left the planet and their resources have been handed to the <UNK> who have make this classic piece of trite garbage just like it's sister in arms league of extraordinary <UNK> they are neither science fiction nor fact entertaining nor thought provoking humorous nor <UNK> but lay in a twilight zone devoid of any and all that <UNK> people to give up their valuable time sit in a <UNK> room and generally be more <UNK> <UNK> or happy at the end of it if we could award turkey points for films like this this would be a <UNK> as we would gone through the turkey ham <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and all other <UNK> before reaching rock bottom
<START> <UNK> is based on the best selling novel by michael <UNK> which i thought lacked <UNK> usual charm smart characters and punch well sorry to say but the same goes for the film br br here's the plot br br greed is bad this simple morality tale <UNK> a <UNK> c e o joe don baker sends his son into the dangerous african <UNK> on a quest for a source of <UNK> large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser <UNK> <UNK> or is it laser weapons when contact is lost with his son and the team his daughter in law laura <UNK> a former cia <UNK> and computer freak is sent after them on her quest she is accompanied by gee <UNK> and a few eccentric characters including a <UNK> ernie hudson a <UNK> with a talking gorilla dylan walsh and a a nutty indiana jones type looking for king <UNK> mines tim <UNK> after some narrow escapes from surface to air <UNK> and some african <UNK> they all discover that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall br br the actors in this movie were not talented dylan walsh acts like a pathetic <UNK> especially at the end ernie hudson is unconvincing is it no wonder he went on to star in tv films and laura <UNK> is nothing special i think i can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles joe don baker and tim <UNK> an always enjoyable actor although sometimes <UNK> for life by constantly being reminded of his rocky horror picture days br br this movie also had some other problems including awful direction style cheesy dialogue and a just plain boring plot which was completely <UNK> when compared to <UNK> novel br br not even stan <UNK> creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster i am deeply disappointed in this movie there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with it was just plain awful cheesy boring and ridiculous and proves to be one of the worst <UNK> book to film productions br br 2 5 stars br br john <UNK>
<START> i've seen the beginning of the muppet movie but just the half because i only watched it at mrs kelly's friend's house the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious they learn that if they believe in the end of the <UNK> anyone can make it no matter how small no matter how green which was included in the trailer br br <UNK> is my favorite protagonist which means it describes the main character and so are the other muppets mel brooks was amazing when he played professor max the scene where miss <UNK> saves <UNK> by doing kung fu on those guys it was so cool br br the muppet movie is the best jim <UNK> film with the most hilarious characters and people will <UNK> for his successful film
<START> yes why among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's gus van <UNK> is one of my <UNK> there are others a few steven <UNK> <UNK> anderson tim hunter danny boyle martin <UNK> harmony wes anderson <UNK> <UNK> some times but consistent surprising unpredictable their names make me switch on the tv go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater van <UNK> psycho however gives me pause why i wonder a shot by shot massacre of one of the <UNK> classics the color was jarring the performances atrocious what was vince vaughn doing was it a parody a bad joke what the hell was it anne <UNK> as janet leigh who dressed her viggo <UNK> with a cowboy hat viggo is a superb actor but in this case he couldn't make us forget john <UNK> and if <UNK> moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there wouldn't have been any the hours for her the minutes maybe so here i am bad <UNK> the work of one of my <UNK> the crashing question remains why mr van <UNK> maybe in the words of president <UNK> because he could i'm afraid that's no excuse
<START> i thought that this was the most interesting film that has done in a very long time i loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film imho may really be on to something going forward a little more light <UNK> some obvious <UNK> to other films mixed in with some great fights i would like to see more this style of film making from him one of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a <UNK> rip off i immediately saw the r rodriguez connection also but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle <UNK> from other films rocks br br other stuff after reading other comments br br no music in the <UNK> fight at first i didn't like that at first either but then i thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn't expect made it seem more real br br i also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was stolen from the studio directors are paid to do a job the studio is the boss and they want the product that they want very few directors have absolute final cut on a film in this case is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film i am sure he got a film that he was happy with i have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story presumably the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film everyone who saw it said it was a disaster then and the studio re edited the movie this stuff happens all the time he also did see the final cut which he claims he didn't and his delicate genius ego was severely <UNK> because they hated his delivered cut if this director was smart he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best
<START> personally the book was a very well written amazing thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie watching the movie at 12 <UNK> in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different outcome of the movie there was something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plot br br for someone who has not read the book i could see how this movie would be seen as <UNK> and entertaining with its controversy and suspense however to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times i did not see the strong connection between the two both the movie and the novel br br with major characters missing such as <UNK> <UNK> and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last <UNK> in the the plot of the movie was slightly <UNK> thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story the too was portrayed as a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a muslim his motives in the book are <UNK> based his ties with the however in the movie his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand
<START> i had a bit of hope for this hour long film made up of footage from old poverty row movies certainly it had the possibility to seem like more than a home video mass <UNK> to the world unfortunately while funny this movie still feels like a home movie but with stock footage spliced in br br the plot concerns the planned reading of a will on a liner at midnight somewhere in the <UNK> the ship sinks and well thats the movie br br the film promises karloff lugosi <UNK> and others being lifted from old movies to interact with new footage we get that alright but mostly we get lots of new video footage made to look like <UNK> black and white film in which new actors <UNK> about old footage is inter cut mostly to set the scene but very little of the old and new actually matches so its clearly just a put on its not very convincing and is very disappointing for someone like me was looking for a better constructed film br br still if you know and love the old poverty row films its very <UNK> this might be worth a viewing i would warn against buying this but it can be had for about five bucks the price of a rental so the choice is yours though if you can get away with not paying for it do so br br disappointing
<START> are you crazy or what this movie has talent who are you to criticize a movie that was made by famous directors and producers i mean you must be watching some crappy version because if you had a proper version you wouldn't think its some low resolution game graphics br br this movie is for people who enjoy <UNK> cinema the other side to what asian people enjoy watching you are such a <UNK> <UNK> cinema is totally different to that of hollywood hk cinema is in a class of its own br br so if you don't enjoy watching movies from <UNK> producers don't go and <UNK> on about how its a waste of time to watch just let other people enjoy the movie br br and personally i've seen this movie and i love its story and the way it was made
<START> i first saw this film two years ago in the cinema and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters <UNK> at home in their large country house with their father and step mother their relationship with their step mother is strained to say the least with the step mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls the film though <UNK> with oriental style ghost effects and horror which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear but is all the more intriguing br br the direction is incredibly good and the acting is stunning with the step mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film the large house adds <UNK> and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat this film to me clearly shows why korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment you simply don't get anything like this in the western world sadly and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade br br highly recommended viewing in my opinion a real joy and scare
<START> classic excellent good fair tragic br br review br br <UNK> is not for everyone it's <UNK> violence its live <UNK> eating and it's story br br the film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years oh <UNK> is released only to find that he must find his <UNK> in 5 days now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this <UNK> and un original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a <UNK> film br br it's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a south korean thriller should be acting scenes are <UNK> with dull humour and a poorly script br br <UNK> is presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about br br verdict br br not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey <UNK> of fog br br tragic
<START> i think we are supposed to think what wonderful salt of the earth characters unfortunately this is lame and <UNK> br br as always with any production set in <UNK> there are numerous shots of the <UNK> bridge and frequent attempts to show what great <UNK> <UNK> are the viewer is never allowed to forget where the film is set as though the rest of the world cared about <UNK> and its inhabitants br br if you like well observed <UNK> and original work stay well clear
<START> this is the worst movie i have seen to date 85 minutes of utterly bad acting half the cast seem to be suffering from syndrome ghastly <UNK> strange make up including tide lines around wig areas and <UNK> than <UNK> characters with <UNK> than <UNK> dialogue that makes you want to <UNK> one comical aspect of this film if you have the patience to watch it is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene was this film backed by a <UNK> <UNK> of desperately dodgy <UNK> casual wear were the cast paid in clothes for their efforts they certainly did not deserve paying with anything else this appalling effort of a film delivers a rambling plot in the first half <UNK> into an equally confused arch christian in the latter the entire cast and production team should be burnt at the stake or at the very least <UNK>
<START> i haven't been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now however i thought i would comment on this film br br this film mistaken one of them as well as madonna was <UNK> by the critics they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews br br first madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first she plays a <UNK> blonde in the film she is far from a <UNK> blonde in real life most critics were somewhat <UNK> by her singing fame and didn't give her a fair shake when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the <UNK> is just acting she was absolutely hysterical as was the film br br <UNK> dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film if you take a look at his filmography you will see he is quite an accomplished actor br br as far as the movie itself this is something similar to pretty woman but came 3 years before the roberts gere success it's a goof ball comedy with lots of site gags slapstick and one liners some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy <UNK> to really appreciate the more subtle humor br br i know this doesn't tell you much about the movie however i hope this helps <UNK> any belief that this is a poor movie it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun br br peace br br gary
<START> this is one of my favorite movies ever along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust this is near perfect cinema rex allen <UNK> this wonderful tale of a <UNK> who just needs a little loving contains action adventure suspense comedy and chaos see this movie if you have to kill to do it you will not find a better cat picture anywhere with cat from outer space coming in as a not so close second charlie's performance is magnificent even includes animal cruelty and intense <UNK> gotta love disney for all moral failures
<START> at the end it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in mrs <UNK> car and it was at the police lab br br but where did the gun under the hood used in the <UNK> come from wouldn't the murderers have <UNK> out the stuff under the hood they had a whole week or did <UNK> cops <UNK> the camera gun under the hood used in the <UNK> how did they do that without breaking and entering the car perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end but how could columbo have <UNK> their camera gun device and gotten it <UNK> to their key <UNK> columbo must have gotten the gun back from and had it re planted under the hood of the car and been very lucky that the rest of the device with camera was still there and <UNK> br br this was a 10 10 show until this glaring plot error at the end
<START> it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days especially for television considering the strong sexual themes and explicit <UNK> scenes not to mention <UNK> this has been given superb treatment and direction br br the sets and costumes are flawless the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark <UNK> the protagonist is really a tragic figure but not devoid of happiness also this production avoids the mistake most films shows make when dealing with homosexuality <UNK> the characters are very human it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay not so with this in <UNK> the <UNK> the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means br br the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past and this adventurous period piece only <UNK> their standard of excellence on all <UNK>
<START> this is about some vampires who can run around out in the <UNK> that are causing some problems down in south america casper van <UNK> is sent in with his team of <UNK> to investigate the movie opens with van <UNK> co walking through the jungle and there's this huge black guy who just absolutely positively cannot act he speaks all his lines as if he's reading them off the cue cards for the very first time his voice is also so low that well it's positively hilarious great way to get the movie started anyhow they run into some of our vampires shoot them this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds and then of course they come back to life van <UNK> notices that one of them was <UNK> across a tree <UNK> and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood the stunt work must be seen to be believed the vampires are on <UNK> that pull them up trees which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily but it just makes them look like they're <UNK> around on <UNK> or something br br yeah anyhow later on the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys van <UNK> not included and they're attacked by more vampires it's really too bad these guys never heard of a <UNK> because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little <UNK> with but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to <UNK> the vampires with by hand the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader van <UNK> ends up battling him later on it doesn't help that all through the movie everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so which would <UNK> a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of hand to hand combat yeah not exactly brilliant tactics br br there's a hot babe remember <UNK> from the lost world tv show yes it's her who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission and she also just happens to be van ex wife hey what are the odds it's a shame she's not in the movie a whole lot more than she is will her and casper get back together in the end will van <UNK> defeat the huge black dude who can't act will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny has even <UNK> carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo she's more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the movie br br i don't know it might score some points on the so bad it's good scale but that's about it eh it's a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle i guess it's kind of entertaining
<START> iv been a fan of and ever since i can remember weather its young ones or bottom and i just have to say i have never laughed so much in all my life guest house <UNK> is bloody brilliant i know its not going to be <UNK> cup of tea with the <UNK> slapstick comedy violence and foul language but then just don't watch it if it ain't yours its not like no one knows what sick and twisted things and come up with when they're working with one another i think its unfair that this film received such a from critics because and i don't think i'm the only one to think this this film is 10 out of 10
<START> i appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering the curse my involvement was during the segments of this film shot in jim <UNK> jim was also one of the locations of the 1969 film the molly <UNK> i reported the <UNK> in the free press newspaper where i was editor 1978 80 the paper <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he 1990s i recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes <UNK> etc the modern streets of jim were covered with <UNK> to <UNK> a 1920s rural town of the south at the time i interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break i did not get to interview james coburn which was always a great disappointment to me as an aside i appear briefly in one of the street scenes wearing a snap <UNK> hat and a <UNK> jacket the producer asked me to jump in and it was a real thrill i still have a collection of black and white stills i took of the production work for the newspaper someday they may be of interest to film television historians lou
<START> i don't understand the humor in this film i also found it offensive on how <UNK> were depicted in that film despite how it is actually just a caricature of <UNK> in those areas first the actors are japanese and they make the most rude expressions of <UNK> in that film it <UNK> me on how these people are expressed i felt anger just watching that one scene and how they were so badly made out in the film the humor lasts just for one laugh and then you don't understand why it's even funny it's crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society there i found it to be an offensive film overall maybe it was just because i never lived in the hood or saw any hood movies but i don't intend to either
<START> like most everyone who views this movie i did it for the stars michael madsen and dennis hopper the two are extremely underrated and sadly because of that have to <UNK> a lot of crap in this film hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a <UNK> and is offered help from the mysterious madsen br br the film actually isn't as terrible as it could have been i've seen both in much worse both <UNK> and working together <UNK> horrible film the direction was pretty poor and the script needed a few re writes but both give the best performance possible with the material offered also the ending is pretty strong so you can tell the story had potential but when a glowing review of a film is it could have been much worse it doesn't say much for the film itself br br all in all this is one that can easily be <UNK> if neither of these actors draw you in but if you're a fan of either or both give it a watch they both give strong performances that <UNK> the obvious flaws of the film trust me there are much worse <UNK> out there
<START> in the mood for love a <UNK> allegory of loneliness and longing here is a film without sex or even kissing and it is no doubt one of the <UNK> and <UNK> the most thought provoking and psychological romance i have ever seen br br telling the story of two people who <UNK> live in the same apartment and are a door away from each other the film like and unlike random hearts is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers only once they receive this news they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair and each other's feelings towards having just broken up and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in love br br what's terrific about the film is the way director wong <UNK> <UNK> presents each character's way of dealing with loneliness with maggie <UNK> character he'll show her in a repeated montage leaving work going home watching her neighbors <UNK> head to the <UNK> shop leave the <UNK> shop and <UNK> into her attractive age equal played by tony <UNK> this is a clever if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness for it is when you are alone when you find yourself falling into a loop this movie worked for me because i can identify with that feeling
<START> robert <UNK> <UNK> day and jean <UNK> star in and one was beautiful a 1940 film also starring <UNK> burke at one hour and 15 minutes this looks to have been a b movie <UNK> is a playboy <UNK> <UNK> whom many women desire including two sisters <UNK> and helen day and <UNK> <UNK> is the more <UNK> of the two who likes to fix cars and helen is the blonde social <UNK> with the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> arrives back in town and believing he's not going to be at a party helen decides not to attend since the party is given by a family friend their mother burke sends <UNK> in a <UNK> up dress <UNK> is there and the two connect but <UNK> is into more <UNK> and when he sees helen at a dinner party the two pick up where they left off and go to a club he becomes terribly drunk and helen at first refuses to ride in his car because he won't let her drive after walking awhile and breaking the <UNK> of her shoe she gets into car when he drives by he passes out and she takes over the wheel accidentally hitting and killing a br br <UNK> can't remember anything so helen lets him take the blame for the death the <UNK> of a woman's shoe is found in the car and <UNK> sees her sister bury her shoes plus something in <UNK> manner makes her realize that helen isn't telling the truth <UNK> is convicted and goes to prison and helen marries a man she doesn't love and leaves for south america br br this is a wonderful film even though at the time this wasn't an a list cast <UNK> is playing a part that robert taylor would have played it's an mgm film he's handsome and very <UNK> even if he doesn't have the dazzling looks of someone like taylor <UNK> day is a favorite actress of mine someone mgm <UNK> out constantly because they didn't know what to do with her why i wonder a wonderful actress with a great face and voice she <UNK> up many a film this one is no different her <UNK> is determined sympathetic and totally lovely jean <UNK> is a lousy actress br br so who was the beautiful one we all know even if mgm didn't br br highly recommended little gem
<START> surprisingly enjoyable movie br br a group of thieves lead by mark <UNK> rob a gold safe in italy and thankfully for them the heist is successful and they get away with it without any big problems before the group can celebrate however steve played by ed norton decides he want the gold all for himself and pulls a <UNK> on the group and shoots one of the members he and his <UNK> leave thinking that the group is dead but luckily the group is not dead a year later we get back into the story where the group has <UNK> down norton and decide to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the movie coming up with plans to steal back their gold and settle a score br br this was a surprise for me it had all the <UNK> to be a typical forgettable summer movie but it was actually memorable and really fun to watch what i like is how smart and well thought out the plans in the movie are and how the movie feels realistic watching the trailer would make you think it was some mindless action movie but in fact there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all really well done the latter action scene is a very long 20 min scene that has one of the best car chases ever done i like how real the chase is and how everything is done old school style without the aid of cgi me personally i enjoyed this car chase more than the cgi filled chase in matrix 2 i remember watching music videos by director f gary gray and always noticed how well made they were and thought he'd make a great filmmaker turns out i was right as always and he proves it here can't wait to see what he does with the sequel br br the actors do a decent job too with seth green being my favorite of the group the other thing i loved was the excellent score by john powell ever since i heard his score for robots this year i've been a fan of him and paying close attention to his music and the man is really good he does a great job of avoiding all the typical summer action movie musical <UNK> and provides a very well done score i haven't seen the original that this is based on so i can't really say how well it <UNK> up to that one br br so yeah this is a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain unlike most of the summer movie crap that comes out has great characters is funny as hell and has a amazing score by john powell if you love heist movies then you'll love this one br br you know if i was in the group they'd call me handsome mike
<START> this film revolves around an <UNK> leader <UNK> who dies and wants to live on so a dr lloyd <UNK> is being paid to transplant brain into a willing <UNK> but in the doctors basement his dwarf assistant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> young girls blood for the doctors purposes so meanwhile doctor pays a man to kill the people who <UNK> <UNK> into the country which is reed hadley grant williams and various unknown <UNK> grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road while this has happened the doctors other assistant <UNK> is sent out to get a body for <UNK> and hurts him so badly dr cant operate meanwhile grant finds girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> and tells her his story grant sees the man who drove him off the road and kills him then since <UNK> failed to get a body d r puts brain into <UNK> body then grant and <UNK> go to the doctors lab an br br spoilers find out his secret soon <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> around killing people and in the <UNK> of what i think is plot dr has a brain ray gun which hurts <UNK> on command it turns out dr lloyd wants a country in which all scientists can work without law so then <UNK> dies and at the end new body i think say that it shall be a new country blah blah br br i still don't get the ending but overall this was a very enjoyable piece of <UNK> cheese this film features grant williams in his second to last film roll i recommend it for any fan of al <UNK> or if you like brains
<START> where do i start the box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt but i'd been taught early on not to judge a book or movie by its cover so i ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway but common sense should tell you that if they can't do a single still image properly then how dismal will the moving ones be later yeah they were pretty awful br br the actors in this flick appeared totally unaware they were being filmed as just any expression seemed to do fine regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were <UNK> to br br however a good story can <UNK> the <UNK> of low budget productions good dialog can carry a poorly <UNK> attempt at times unfortunately this was not one of those times as the story was as weak and nonexistent as the other required elements of good cinema br br there simply aren't words for how bad this was br br perhaps you can get the idea from my rating of 2 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i gave 9 of 10 points i was sitting in tears nearly the whole movie because i had to laugh br br the story of course wasn't excellent but it also wasn't boring <UNK> are assigned to become <UNK> for the beautiful nina while doing this job they come between the front lines of and cia of course the two are neither born <UNK> nor gentlemen so they run from one disaster into another and they do this in such a funny way that when you watch some scenes you won't be able to stop the tears as actors those two <UNK> <UNK> characters do quite well better than some so called professional br br you think the speech of the two heroes is <UNK> or pseudo foreign well if you hear quite a lot turkish german people in <UNK> speaking exactly like them you will remember <UNK> and maybe in 10 years it might have become the common speech of the youth god <UNK> br br so if you like to laugh watch this movie
<START> i saw this film back in the early 70's and i was <UNK> by judy <UNK> for me it captured the <UNK> nature of rod <UNK> obsession with the young and extremely sexy <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> br br you couldn't help feel a little sorry for the wife played brilliantly by claire bloom i was really disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on dvd br br i defy anyone who saw the film and it's strong message not to be equally absorbed by the three main character performances and i would have loved to have seen it again if nothing else for a purely nostalgic reason br br going back in time some 35 years br br a real classic
<START> i am a fan of randolph scott westerns while some of them are amazingly clichéd as are most westerns of this era his easy delivery and style really elevate the films to classic and near classic status while this film features yet another example of real life western heroes being exploited after their death by hollywood in this case bat masterson the film works well due to him as well as excellent supporting characters one is the always strong acting of robert ryan an excellent actor who is sadly almost forgotten today the other is the <UNK> <UNK> hayes who has one of his best roles as the <UNK> and very colorful deputy here he is more enjoyable than in his many supporting roles for roy rogers and john wayne mostly because his part is better written and he's given more to do br br the plot is pretty much the plot of half the westerns ever made there are some baddies who hire a bunch of thugs to run <UNK> over the locals and it's up to a do <UNK> scott to <UNK> the peace and kill off the villains however how the plot is executed is much better than average and due to this the film is still watchable fun just don't expect a whole lot of <UNK> or <UNK> unless you want to see what might just be <UNK> best performance
<START> there is only one film i can think of that might be as good or better than this one when it comes to bugs bunny and <UNK> duck ali <UNK> bunny however <UNK> which is the best is irrelevant just watch them both and enjoy br br i compared this to ali <UNK> bunny because both feature <UNK> at his absolute worst greedy nasty and very funny in the process however i think i prefer rabbit <UNK> simply because bugs is also pretty awful in this one doing horrible things right back to <UNK> every time <UNK> tries a dirty trick br br the film begins with <UNK> leaving rabbit tracks right up to hole in the hope that a hunter naturally it's elmer will blast the rabbit and leave <UNK> alone not to be <UNK> bugs time and again takes all of tricks and turns them around and in most cases it involves <UNK> getting shot in the face it's all very very clever and funny and i don't care how old you are this cartoon will make you laugh unless you are a <UNK> i especially love the great and unexpected ending but i won't say more as i don't want to spoil the surprise
<START> this movie seems a little clunky around the edges like not quite enough <UNK> was thrown it when it should have been but i mostly enjoyed it br br the storyline is more than a little bit preposterous so no expectation of something real should be included in your viewing experience check your brain in at the door it will not be needed and might be an <UNK> otherwise br br i quite enjoyed performance as the real dr his role was spot on for giving <UNK> character a protagonist what a <UNK> the real dr was br br and matthau was quite good as the lead character's sidekick annoying at first but ultimately lovable sort of kind of or at least something the use of a bar of soap and a lot of water would have been more than helpful br br actually worth watching if you're in the mood for a spoof on the psychiatric profession sure why not
<START> americans next top model is the best reality show i was entertained 99 9 percent of the time watching it i kept my eyes open the entire time well i did blink it can be sad funny or <UNK> mostly <UNK> america's next top model kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point it is also on more that one channel sometimes it's on mtv other times it's not i hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series it's great for pretty much all ages so every can enjoy it br br also if you watched the show before haven't you noticed that <UNK> has a different hair style each time in the judging room she'll have it short and curly one week and then long and straight the next
<START> this series is formulaic and boring the episodes are the same thing every week simply with slightly varied settings some purely evil character does some <UNK> deed walker goes after him and it ends in a karate match the villains are super cliché super stereotypical evil villains the good guys are all pure honest and <UNK> and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic after about 2 episodes the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least <UNK> fans certainly not <UNK> best work his other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks if you enjoy formulaic boring repetitive clichéd <UNK> <UNK> then this is for you
<START> considering it's basically low budget cast this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock <UNK> buddy holly gary busey stars as holly who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music backed up by his <UNK> holly had a string of hits and became a <UNK> <UNK> star before his death in a plane crash along with <UNK> and the big <UNK> the film follows his rise to stardom marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death i like this film and believe that you will too charles martin smith also does a great job in this film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> who hasn't made one decent film directed this notorious shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its japanese release br br yes it does feature scenes of rape gore and <UNK> but so what it has the style of a bad american porn film shot and badly photographed by ed powers dirty <UNK> and is incredibly slow br br it seems to have earned its <UNK> based on its <UNK> of anti social acts br br there is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced br br just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this on the contrary that kind of fan myself for example <UNK> even less crap than the average <UNK> out there because he's seen so much and has become overly <UNK> it's a shame production companies don't realize that br br one reviewer here commented that the film's near obsession with gang rape is one of the factors that killed it i disagree the subject matter is never the issue the issue is how that subject matter is treated in <UNK> of a beautiful woman it is treated so <UNK> that it is boring br br personally i like graphic depictions of <UNK> behavior with an intriguing context if the material is well directed <UNK> photographed and <UNK> pleasing this horror pink hybrid is <UNK>
<START> to start off this happens to be my favorite of the st <UNK> br br in addition to critical comments i'll throw in some more getting technical when the enterprise fires it's <UNK> at a blind target they'd have to be mighty close to direct hits i believe in order to cause any <UNK> much less damage to the <UNK> with the <UNK> of space to <UNK> with br br i had somewhat of a problem with the commander questioning his faith in the <UNK> or their <UNK> unless it has to do with attacking vulnerable targets <UNK> in the neutral zone that are not at war also i don't think commander would fall for the basic or simple tactics that kirk played such as playing dead or falling for the <UNK> that the <UNK> puts on him about whether or not to attack the enterprise when it is playing dead br br on the enterprise i'm surprised that after seeing the method of attack earlier that <UNK> would say are they <UNK> when it attacks the enterprise the first time br br funny how spock can only get the <UNK> done on the weapons control right when the <UNK> is over br br also in the final attack i thought the <UNK> was too long so long that spock could run down a couple <UNK> and back to the weapons room and <UNK> and fire the <UNK> <UNK> i would have used at this point but i'm sure it had to do with the <UNK> and budget br br on the positive side it's a good drama played on the <UNK> in which to introduce us to the <UNK> great scenes with stiles telling a good deal of the human knowledge of the <UNK> also his conflict with spock is right up there i wished <UNK> character would have stayed on the show for a while if for nothing else than the energy he added br br it's only in fun that i point out the <UNK> and goofs i'm sure there are more but for me this is as good as it gets balance of terror is always the one i place at the top in my st <UNK>
<START> this was the film that started that the cinematic love affair br br between the <UNK> eye crew and matthew <UNK> his br br ability to portray relatively normal characters like in br br la femme <UNK> is counter balanced by his equally <UNK> br br handling of <UNK> like kane one wishes that he would only br br be given more roles bigger roles and other even more complex br br roles to <UNK> to push the limits of his abilities there were br br four or five memorable scenes in this film and matthew <UNK> br br stole two of them from far more experienced actors this film br br itself is good and it is worth watching on its own merits but br br <UNK> makes it a little extra special his may br br eventually show what the career of anthony <UNK> might have br br been like if he hadn't been <UNK> as norman bates so long br br ago kane isn't quite as whacked out as norman and far fewer br br people saw love and human remains than saw psycho so we can br br hope that <UNK> will show us some hint of what <UNK> might br br have been able to accomplish had he been allowed to do so
<START> i was a 20 year old college student living with the folks when i first saw this and i've never forgotten it i'm a huge joan <UNK> fan and this film was perfect for her remarkable talent i'm so glad to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing this naturally it's not available on any media it would be perfect to show on lifetime but because of its age they won't you never see anything there before the mid eighties i can still remember what made me watch it when it was first run rex reed reviewed it in the new york daily news and he said that it was like a <UNK> to the great hollywood films of the forties and had it been made then the <UNK> and parts would have been played by stanwyck and crawford think about that p s so sad that joan <UNK> left us so <UNK> young
<START> wow this movie really really sucks <UNK> said br br the story a <UNK> internet predator stalks and <UNK> young men and women into <UNK> traps it goes like this kidnaps people they find him he becomes a changed man and is released on the world yet again <UNK> back to his old ways and starts the torture again the story is stupid it's implausible the characters are stupid they're implausible or at the very least way over the top it's got some very violent imagery and if you have a week stomach you might just want to stay away but than again even if you don't have a week stomach you might want to stay away it's that stupid br br the cast dee <UNK> kevin gage if you're a die hard fan of twisted sister and dee <UNK> you might find this one interesting since he's the writer and star of this film his acting is laughably bad and you can tell that he's the one that wrote the god awful script kevin gage well they say he's been in numerous other movies that i've seen but i don't remember him from any of them and you won't remember him from this these two sadly make the film they don't make it good mind you they just make it br br one to five scale 1 it's bad it's very very very bad in fact it's so bad that this movie should come with a clip <UNK> pistol to play russian with
<START> like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down so many turned to television where probably they <UNK> their <UNK> for <UNK> donna reed is a case in point br br i don't think donna reed ever thought that donna stone was anything challenging not to a woman who had won an oscar for playing a very different type in from here to eternity she was certainly better prepared to play wife mother and <UNK> donna stone after having played mary <UNK> in it's a wonderful life br br donna was always beautiful and wise and ever helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband carl was not an idiot he was a <UNK> who had his office attached to the house talk about the man being ever ready in a crisis br br though this was the donna reed show because <UNK> husband at the time tony owen produced it yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children shelley and paul <UNK> had that best selling teen record johnny angel which she introduced on the show she successfully made the transition to adult star most known for her role in coach as craig t <UNK> wife br br but <UNK> was a <UNK> teen idol back in the day the donna reed show dare i say got most of its viewers because of him it's forgotten now but <UNK> also had a best selling record my dad didn't do half as well as johnny angel br br now paul <UNK> runs a support group for former child stars like himself so many of them end so <UNK> it's good work that he's doing br br the stone family was the <UNK> of middle america they lived in a <UNK> near chicago they led wholesome lives mom and dad were always there for the kids of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking <UNK> br br it's this series i believe was the model for the tv town of <UNK> where <UNK> maguire and reese <UNK> are sucked into br br i have pleasant memories of the donna reed show easy to take but not too seriously
<START> this movie is an example of small budget <UNK> star cast weak storyline and poor entertainment this kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die hard fans of bollywood movies i went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also only thing i appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way she very much resembles bollywood actress <UNK> <UNK> she is good sexy and acting well she definitely go up in her career our was all time good at his work <UNK> he has some good to the movie i didn't like for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor this movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress never try this movie
<START> the film is a pathetic attempt to remake <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1978 starring ingrid bergman <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out br br it is time film <UNK> like <UNK> took out time to do some creative thinking it makes me sad when potentially good film makers waste their talents by making <UNK> remakes of hollywood and european films br br you've got to give the film maker something though the film he picked for <UNK> is one of <UNK> classics and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in european cinema
<START> my favorite film this year great characters and plot and the direction and editing was smooth visually beautiful and interesting br br set in <UNK> the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and <UNK> others cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives <UNK> the leading role would never have been cast in hollywood but he carried the part perfectly the characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate there were two especially noteworthy scenes the climax was truly inspired the film is sentimental and the last ten minutes could have been cut but it was wonderfully entertaining br br i nearly didn't watch it but did just to see audrey <UNK> her role although billed second or third was minor and was <UNK> by several other characters i wish more films like this were made it brought to mind the big chill or the breakfast club don't start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1 2 way through
<START> a dedicated russian scientist dreams of going to mars he eventually gets there but it takes the whole film before we are able to have a laugh at the russian style of revolution in mars
<START> wasted is just that a waste of time mtv is <UNK> out made for tv movies at quite a clip nowadays a friend of mine recommended this and i rented it needless to say i will not be pursuing anymore from her anytime soon this movie shows the <UNK> of drug use the problem is you really don't care about any of the characters due to lack of and their own self discipline this movie is in a word annoying to watch from the terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing the format tries for realism but comes up distracting if you want a true scope on drug use watch <UNK> for a dream
<START> heart of darkness movie review joseph <UNK> heart of darkness is pretty dark deep and very profound i would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie the character mr <UNK> played by john was totally the wrong actor to do the part he fit the character in of mice and men the movie left out man key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story br br the movie is poorly edited it shows a lot of non important and annoying flashes in the novel it has a very suspenseful atmosphere but in the movie it lacks that kind of feeling in the book there is so much that was left to the imagination of the reader for example when <UNK> spent timeless hours and days waiting for <UNK> and that entire scene was left out of the movie in the novel <UNK> waited very long time for the <UNK> to come for him to fix his boat this was a big source of <UNK> in the novel the movie added more parts that were useless and kind of didn't make sense for example when <UNK> was talking to <UNK> at the end of the book and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> neck and killed him that kind of just ruined everything didn't make any sense to me what so ever so my suggestion to you is don't view the movie just read the book you will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story br br chris c
<START> i had no idea what this movies was about it jumps from plot line to plot line <UNK> <UNK> incoherent ideas with one another it simply doesn't make sense br br the chopped up time line doesn't help either we start in present day get a flash back to the past and then return to the future only to go back into the past br br this movie is also filled with horrible sappy lines and cliché themes such as princess and the <UNK> you cant have me even in my death lines you don't even love me enough line cliché to the max br br fighting scene were horribly corny lighting was constantly misplaced which <UNK> the cg with the actors you could tell some of the backgrounds were clearly cg br br although the society in <UNK> moon was quite interesting br br i wouldn't really recommend his to anyone avoid if possible br br if you found this comment hard to follow the movie would be equally as bad
<START> ham handed homage to honest <UNK> felt good in a soft core way about equivalent to its mild pornography until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality emotional and moral sophistication became apparent br br basically a muddled <UNK> remake of real genius with fewer and <UNK> geniuses and a cynical bad ending br br perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the <UNK> that becoming a <UNK> is so easy it's almost accidental or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy <UNK> about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself the movies closing credits song is more interesting than the movie itself
<START> this horrible action  sci fi movie is a crap i have just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies i have ever seen the story does not make any sense there are lots of flaws in the screenplay the characters are badly developed the unknown cast is horrible the lead ham actor seems to be too old for his role i was induced to buy this vhs which has a magnificent cover and see this crap due to the illogical imdb user rating and some ten stars reviews i have just checked the authors and each one of them has just one short review of l i n x <UNK> in imdb and nothing else why are they promoting such a garbage my vote is one br br title brazil l i n x l i n x lethal connection
<START> the most stupid of <UNK> movies i've ever seen the final scene is just <UNK> of stupidity my recommendation if you really like <UNK> <UNK> movies never never rent or buy this one do not repeat my mistake and keep a good impression of him which i've lost
<START> this movie was terrible you couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie it came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and i literally hit the <UNK> button right in the middle of the scene it was one of the worst movies i have ever experienced worse than all dean cain films combined to start the acting was terrible i realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor but one would think that any tv experience would have given them a little more talent the movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality in the movies defense the theme of the show was well <UNK> and the story was all right
<START> nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to put him to death and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an <UNK> so they do and soon enough all of the medical students want to know if there is life after death the <UNK> isn't about <UNK> gates and lights at the end of the tunnel but something more sinister br br past ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone it has some pretty scary moments that could translate into real life and it makes people wonder somewhat about what happens when you die it's a good movie to see when it's <UNK> and you're feeling down it's also a little weird br br see it with a haunted past
<START> i still count police squad as the absolute funniest tv show of the 1980s somewhere on <UNK> no less i have all six episodes i knew that a show this good wouldn't last and that i had to <UNK> it for myself how stupid was abc they were <UNK> as saying that viewers didn't know that police squad was a comedy because it had no laugh track right when has a line like you take chances just getting up in the morning driving to work or sticking your face in a fan how can that be comedy i've seen every episode at least ten times and still see something new i missed before even the deep backgrounds always have gags ongoing don't miss it if you have chance to see an episode but if you're reading this then you probably already have copies away <UNK> as i do
<START> i've seen about a half dozen of the low budget poverty row b westerns that ken <UNK> made in the 1930s and i am consistently amazed at how poor an actor he was how did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor they say that he could ride pretty well back in the <UNK> but he doesn't do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films still maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ride br br phantom <UNK> isn't as bad as some of the other ken <UNK> films i've seen but it still isn't much some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a young <UNK> where it appears to me that he's just as old as the other older actors br br and if that's not silly enough there's a rather significant script problem in this film at one point one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the <UNK> of a well something that hadn't happened yet just a couple of minutes later we then see that particular scene no it wasn't a flashback at first i thought perhaps that when <UNK> films was doing the dvd transfer they might have <UNK> two of the <UNK> but in those days film <UNK> contained approximately 11 minutes of film and the whole <UNK> only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops everything else was in a logical order so it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film maybe that's one reason why colony pictures didn't last very long
<START> this is the second movie about 1985 the other one was 'the wedding whilst the was portraying the pop side of the 80's <UNK> <UNK> is all about metal br br mark <UNK> plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and jennifer aniston plays his girlfriend when his <UNK> <UNK> him his whole life changes in a day br br the story doesn't get too dramatic and it only <UNK> the surface of the life of a rock star sex and drugs are very limited in this movie but it is full of roll the music is fantastic and the <UNK> are directed brilliantly the whole concert feeling is very well captured since they used real audiences no cgi here br br great direction and a brilliant performance by <UNK> mark who acts like a true metal dude br br <UNK> <UNK> is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene you are going to love this movie br br 10 10
<START> three young college women and pia go on an adventure <UNK> down the river <UNK> their <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> in this 2002 <UNK> film by <UNK> <UNK> what could have been an eastern european version of the well known and exciting 1972 deliverance turned out for me to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic <UNK> with the characters br br and are not convincing as students at all though expresses a desire to be a writer and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be <UNK> along in life even less <UNK> is a self absorbed adventure <UNK> with an attraction to other women i had some sympathy with relatively innocent conservative and <UNK> eyed the very idea of these three traveling together just doesn't work for me the disdain that and show toward makes no sense why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudes br br the three begin a <UNK> journey down the river on two <UNK> <UNK> by a news story of a woman's disappearance along the river things become more somber with the mysterious appearance sometimes real and sometimes possibly <UNK> of a <UNK> conservative <UNK> politician <UNK> br br i did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small <UNK> the trio visit it may be because of a lack of cultural understanding but the film didn't move me otherwise i was surprised to see that the film has won some awards
<START> i saw the korean version of daisy first it came across as a simple love story that <UNK> nicely from start to finish i saw it 3 times as i waited for my copy of the director's cut to arrive br br then i got the <UNK> and watched it wow i think this is the first real director's cut i've ever seen amazing how detailed the editing is in both versions the <UNK> is laid out like a hardcore thriller with the love story in the background it moves at a slower pace than the korean version the variations between both versions are so <UNK> it seems like two totally different movies i thought i would be worn out watching the movie again it out just to look for the added scenes that wasn't the case it really felt like i was watching a whole new movie br br while the <UNK> is 20 minutes longer than the korean version you'll be hard pressed to <UNK> where or what has been changed 2 seconds chopped off here a second added there an entire scene added here another <UNK> there in both versions scenes have been added <UNK> or chopped up and in some scenes entire lines of dialogue were replaced or while the scene itself was <UNK> even simple sound effects were added <UNK> from each version having a major impact on the mood of the film and sometimes even changing the outcome of a scene what comes across as a tender moment in the korean version is a sad somber one in the <UNK> the endings of both versions leave room for interpretation as far as i can tell both versions end a lot different and were intended that way br br i'm assuming most people will be <UNK> the director's cut of the film and will find the movie pretty decent but a little long and boring if that's the case look for the korean version same movie but different feel i think there's a <UNK> 3 dvd version that contains both cuts of the film not sure br br the versions compliment each other so well that as a pair i'll watch daisy more often than i do any of my other favorite korean movies alone i'd say the korean version is a nice love story that i'd watch once in awhile the director's cut i'll watch maybe once or twice then never again as i find the pacing dull but they just go so well together for what i consider the best experience i'd say watch the korean version first then watch the director's cut to help fill in the gaps of the story that you were curious about br br the editing is the real star of the film
<START> probably the best horror movie in 5 years there's been lame remakes attempts to make you scared when all they make you do is walk out of the theater and movies that just shouldn't have been made but this one is worth it the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because paris hilton is in it but her death scene makes up for it believe me br br so here they are the spoilers of all the death scenes in the movie br br 1 my favorite death scene ever paris <UNK> after finding her boyfriend blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck <UNK> starts to run well speed walk is more respectable she finds this like garage with all these cars in it then one of the killers cuts her <UNK> from below this whole time <UNK> holding a huge metal spike so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her <UNK> i've never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life br br 2 <UNK> boyfriend blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him while hes on the ground and steps on it pushing it <UNK> into his throat then he dies br br 3 elisha <UNK> <UNK> one of the <UNK> chicks ever doesn't die <UNK> but she does get her lips super glued together <UNK> in the face and gets part of her <UNK> finger chopped off yeah i felt like <UNK> 4 twin brother nick also survives but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg br br 5 <UNK> best friend dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs and then is decapitated his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink then he gets covered in wax br br 6 <UNK> boyfriend gets his <UNK> <UNK> by a massive pair of <UNK> and then is attacked by the same <UNK> he doesn't die but hes covered in wax and on 2 occasions his skin is accidentally removed revealing his nasty bloody flesh <UNK> br br so there it is definitely worth your money
<START> this is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the season 11 episodes with the exception of the trilogy this is the one that made laugh the most definitely is my favourite so far of season 11 so basically <UNK> sees at a toy store a kid who has the <UNK> syndrome and a new idea comes to <UNK> you can imagine now <UNK> has <UNK> syndrome and is great since kyle once he knows about this is like he's <UNK> <UNK> is certainly on fire saying whatever he wants to the teachers to the principal to anybody on the other hand we have kyle who now is the <UNK> one basically for saying that <UNK> was <UNK> he was taken to meet children with <UNK> syndrome just to let him see that <UNK> syndrome is for real and is great since kyle is like well maybe someone is <UNK> to have <UNK> for fun in short kyle could not explain that <UNK> was <UNK> probably my favourite scene of this episode is when <UNK> is with <UNK> family but right after this scene another kid <UNK> that <UNK> is simply <UNK> the kid with <UNK> who was at the toy store <UNK> basically said to that kid this isn't having <UNK> awesome but to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for <UNK> his master plan going on national tv to say anything he wants people will call it brilliant tv they'll probably give me an emmy fantastic in this episode the word s is used 26 times and certainly that's not all south park won an emmy like a month or so before this episode aired but here there's a twist <UNK> basically removed all the <UNK> of the wall he says now everything without thinking so we hear from <UNK> that he wet his bed last night now is not fun for <UNK> and he is like i can't control what i say and certainly the person who was with him is like well of course you can't control what you say you have <UNK> so <UNK> is like my <UNK> has gotten worse before i just <UNK> out cool stuff about jews being lame and stuff but now it's gotten really bad there is also stuff about chris <UNK> and to catch a predator actually what happened with a <UNK> here happens with a lot more <UNK> kyle and thomas were behind that to stop <UNK> kyle ends being <UNK> fantastic br br voices concern over south park october 3rd episode br br on <UNK> october 3 the cable network comedy central will air an episode of the animated series south park in which one of the young characters <UNK> gets syndrome given the nature of this program we fully expect it to be offensive and <UNK> to people with <UNK> and garner numerous calls and <UNK> from our members and the <UNK> community br br we have already taken some pre strikes such as <UNK> that comedy central air our public service <UNK> featuring comedian richard lewis during or after the show in addition once the episode <UNK> and we are able to see exactly how <UNK> is portrayed we will be able to respond with specific issues and problems we have with the show to the writers br br we are actually surprised it took the creators so long to use <UNK> as comedy fodder in this program since no <UNK> illness or controversial topic is off limits to them said <UNK> president br br we always see portrayals of <UNK> good and bad as an opportunity for awareness and education and a show of this <UNK> and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for to spread factual information about the disorder said tracy flynn manager of public relations and <UNK> br br we will be <UNK> an official statement on this site with reaction to the program after the show <UNK> br br responds to south park episode br br unfortunately as has been the case with far too many media portrayals of people with syndrome <UNK> the season opener of south park le <UNK> 10 3 <UNK> served to <UNK> even further the outright myth that most of those affected by <UNK> have <UNK> <UNK> of foul language in point of fact fully 85 90 of people with <UNK> never experience this <UNK> socially <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for viewers less familiar with the <UNK> of this <UNK> disorder the misleading take away message couldn't have been <UNK>  unless you curse you don't have <UNK> br br despite our pre airing <UNK> we do <UNK> that the episode was surprisingly well <UNK> the highly exaggerated emphasis on notwithstanding for the <UNK> viewer there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed the scripted <UNK> from parents a <UNK> peers and the therapy session with the <UNK> children's support group all served as a clever device for providing these facts to the public no doubt this south park episode did generate <UNK> national awareness about <UNK> nevertheless we are very concerned that school children with <UNK> will be <UNK> and even <UNK> by <UNK> peers who may have seen the program said <UNK> president we realize that for over a decade the <UNK> satirical parodies have <UNK> no group be they celebrities the disabled or political figures the fact that <UNK> was the subject of a popular tv show <UNK> to the fact that the public is so much more aware of the disorder obviously this <UNK> awareness we've worked too hard to accomplish can at times prove to be a double edged sword br br <UNK> the <UNK> executives prior to the airing and we will be in touch with them again perhaps we'll succeed in turning this into an opportunity for positive <UNK> awareness
<START> the filming is cheesy some of the actors <UNK> some of the actions are unexplained and <UNK> but br br this movie is in the mode of the psychological dramas of the 50s br br it is a morality play similar to the movie in which a method actor becomes the evil character he portrays on stage ed is forced to watch slasher movies because he is the film editor it gives him a nervous breakdown which leads to a complete psychotic break br br
<START> i just finished watching one episode <UNK> 5 a boy in a bush so maybe my review is not very fair br br but based on that episode this is a very poor version of <UNK> the acting is crap the main character dr whatever her name is is so fake it actually hurts i wouldn't cast her to do an add for dog food br br the other <UNK> thing is david <UNK> of the angel fame a good actor does a great job but wasted <UNK> of the idiotic acting of that woman br br supporting cast is ok but all is ruined due to this stupid acting of emily <UNK> br br very disappointing version of <UNK> very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it br br that woman is really sh t at least in that episode but based on this one view i will not even <UNK> watching it even if it was shown on an elevator screen
<START> there's no point in comparing this with the original series though different in look and content both are true to the original idea that is an sf horror anthology series due to indifferent <UNK> in australia i've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons the very first episode really did give me the creeps nightmares at my age but a number of others did fall flat generally when the stories moved into horror <UNK> and away from sf i only hope the dvds reach us eventually
<START> i really liked this movie i watched it last night on the public <UNK> system the part i liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past they basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs i think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time it did show the fact that england or any other country isn't prepared for an attack on the <UNK> that they showed i have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so i can't really say if they are normally their parts after the movie they had this <UNK> of experts talking about if something like that could happen here in the u s it was a thought provoking discussion
<START> this episode from season one titled ironically answer me is a pretty well done and memorable episode and it takes a shocking twist at the end you have jean <UNK> as an over the hill and washed up actress from l a who's moved to new york city for an audition and she's living in an apartment provided by an old friend oddly every night she's kept awake by a <UNK> phone from the next door apartment yet oddly enough the <UNK> where the <UNK> phone continues to ring is <UNK> as the guests have been dead for many years finally she has to give in only she should have followed along and not answered the phone with no one home as it's bad to get wrapped up in a phone with a life of it's own overall good episode a strange one though about a supernatural phone still it's suspenseful and it twists well at the end
<START> i saw this film when it first came out and hated it i just saw it again 27 years later i actually liked some of it although robin williams was totally wrong for the role what i remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what i had understood when i read the book since i haven't re read it i can only give you my impressions from the past but i am sure of one thing the film is a <UNK> to family life whereas in the book almost all traditional <UNK> including and perhaps especially marriage are shown to be <UNK> <UNK> that we would be well rid of the only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air too bad williams doesn't have a <UNK> of his charm my low mark is therefore from the fact that the film <UNK> the book as a film on its own it <UNK> better but only for a few key performances mary beth hurt is wonderful i think anyone watching it would fall in love with her and john <UNK> as an ex football player who has had a sex change operation is fantastic he never once <UNK> it up or made the character anything but commendable and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity i watched him closely during all of his scenes and never once was he anything except <UNK> nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen and that made all the difference in fact of all the people in the film his is the only one which is <UNK> it is worth seeing this film only for his performance
<START> i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick and i've always been a fan of foreign films however for someone who likes movies i was surprised at how much i hate hate hated this movie br br although it does aim to expose the lives of young men in <UNK> and to an extent it does the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them br br although the story <UNK> revolves around m he rarely ever speaks and his <UNK> is at best amazingly dry and dull br br warning some small spoilers br br basically the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs but without success he does gain <UNK> twice but <UNK> because they're not for him when you're poor the last option you have is to be <UNK> some amount of time is spent with his friends who's idea of fun is to rape a little 14 year old steal crappy <UNK> off a piece of <UNK> car for a dime sack of <UNK> and several other slightly retarded activities br br <UNK> friend with a plan to make 25 000 a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami when the drug lord gives them a job we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given 200 to shop get there hair cut and then <UNK> off looking like slick gangsters one character carlos will from this point on wear <UNK> always even at night the day before they leave the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord leaving m and his friend to be dumb they party up take several <UNK> of the drugs they're suppose to run and break into <UNK> old school acting like animals and <UNK> everything in sight br br the movie ends when m tries calling his girlfriend who hangs up on him the friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire which brings out a bunch of kids and some old man with gun m and friend in charge of the drug run shows up on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now then he takes off by himself and gets shot by that old man the police show up and arrest m and his friends but not the man who shot the guy and cover <UNK> dead friend up with <UNK> as music plays and it fades to credits br br end spoiler br br i even watched this movie a second time hoping to see some subtle redeeming factor for it but i did not a complete waste of <UNK> minutes although i must give it credit for being straightforward and not <UNK> away from disturbing elements the casting acting and overall direction still leaves much much much to be desired br br imho if you're interested in a movie that explores the issues this one was suppose to go rent city of god de <UNK> instead avoid this trash at all costs you have been warned
<START> it's difficult to express how bad this movie is even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of physical <UNK> clean clothes <UNK> etc was a common reaction to the smug middle class <UNK> of both the usa and western europe this movie would have been a stinker the plot is a <UNK> of several <UNK> ex <UNK> if that's the correct latin <UNK> the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional <UNK> by the male lead as well as the females the gratuitous view of catherine <UNK> or <UNK> breasts are worthy of a <UNK> commercial the repeated orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie i'm <UNK> because my time has been wasted watching this <UNK> excuse for an art <UNK> the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot but underneath his clothes this king has no substance
<START> one of the best <UNK> blues br br great movie great cast great music this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes i will this one many times br br this is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and <UNK> you emotionally throughout the feature the cast is extraordinary without the <UNK> hint of anyone being in their role you get the sense that you're really there taking all this in a great deal of care was given in the sets costumes and music of the period the relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on but the steady performance of ms is so powerful that the movie ends before we've had our fill of the wonderful <UNK> to single out anyone other than <UNK> is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including br br <UNK> wright jimmy <UNK> howard and <UNK> <UNK> but it is marcus franklin macy gray and ms that makes this a wonderful experience br br the movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards but it is without question one of the best movies you're going to see this year if you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally <UNK> at your heart lift you <UNK> and have you <UNK> your feet at the same time then this is the movie for you i've shown it to several friends and they all want my copy that says it all the movie is that good check it out for yourself br br 1 <UNK> holland
<START> the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character rather than star turns the need to stage special effects obligatory romance and endless car chases however there is a car chase in here and a dandy it is <UNK> quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer <UNK> to eliminate him it is rare that a second or third <UNK> actor such as quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries a film usually such a role is given to an a list actor with box office draw which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that <UNK> quinn ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which <UNK> in <UNK> fashion toward the end and not all at once as we're used to seeing the paranoia and <UNK> of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity the locations are convincing and effective the soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb and or meaningless plot developments unconvincing star turns loud annoying music video type <UNK> a villain that <UNK> it up and repeatedly a cast costumes and plot that <UNK> mostly to an audience under 25 this is an outstanding thriller which most <UNK> did not get its just due upon its release 1 2 of 4 stars
<START> this movie was so awful that i can't even describe it i was amazed that i even sat through this pile of trash i couldn't believe that a movie like this was even thought of it was a about a serial killer that like a chicken he doesn't just a couple of times he non stop through out the whole movie he even <UNK> his arms like a chicken which is even <UNK> than anything i have ever seen i couldn't believe this came out in 1990 i thought it came out in the early <UNK> or something then the daughter isn't very smart either because she was protecting the geek or man chicken the end just gets worse and is the worse ending i have ever seen this movie is just chicken s t i was laughing more than i was scared and i strongly suggest going out and getting a bucket of fried chicken instead of seeing this movie
<START> i have to say this is better than most <UNK> <UNK> but that isn't saying much br br the plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the spanish <UNK> and nobody ever expects the spanish <UNK> he and his friends play the game only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted br br what then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this or any of the final destination movies it has the puzzle at the end and the interesting subplot with the cop who wants the game to bring back his family but otherwise it's just a mess
<START> what i came away with after watching this movie was a guilty conscience the film itself has a rather intriguing plot line and premise to it but unfortunately it is a movie that you cannot watch with out being <UNK> with pornography if you plan on viewing this and have a moral problem with the <UNK> of the marital act for the viewing pleasure of an audience then you are making a big mistake this is not the type of movie with the token sex scene that you can skip on your dvd player near the beginning of the film <UNK> character is video <UNK> his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner this tape and others like it continue to pop up throughout the movie at unpredictable times it appears that the film is attempting to make a statement about the dignity of women ironically in doing so they made multiple women into prostitutes i only gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because had they handled <UNK> <UNK> better it would have been an interesting film
<START> wow i didn't even know about this movie until i was searching for the name of another mark <UNK> classic time runner some things are better left unknown mark <UNK> role is quite limited i would compare his appearance in this movie to all those appearances of vincent price and christopher lee in those bad horror b movies of the 60's and 70's in those movies they appeared in the the first and last 5 minutes of the movie memorable acting by mark with such great lines as don't try to run you're under arrest did i mention he says that exact thing more than once bill paxton fell into an type spiral of drugs and booze after aliens because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a <UNK> session the hair the hair priceless bill truly should have been game over for bill but somehow he got treatment and went on to better movies this movie blows it is more dull and boring than the <UNK> at least that movie was crazy this is just boring do not watch this movie sober
<START> i have recently found this film on one of my husband's vhs tapes the blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly the film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and i don't remember having seen it since it has not to my knowledge been released on dvd or vhs although i shall <UNK> around for a copy br br the film tells the story of three young people two girls one on the edge of <UNK> and the other much younger and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young mute irish wife his wife also has two brothers who live with them the children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a <UNK> show put on by him and her brothers in his br br the <UNK> girl and one of the <UNK> the younger develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house the girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the <UNK> br br there are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film there is the <UNK> treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb literally possession illustrated by the collar whilst the irish <UNK> dancing drinking and somewhat forbidden love interestingly though i have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in hollywood today br br makes you wonder whether the british film industry and the bbc have some kind of hidden agenda going on br br still despite it not being a children's movie there are a lot of playful magic moments in it and the one <UNK> does some beautiful paintings
<START> the real best picture of <UNK> also deals with anti <UNK> and is superior to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the eventual winner at that year's academy awards in practically every department near perfect direction john <UNK> <UNK> script and j roy <UNK> expert <UNK> lighting are wonderfully <UNK> by a superb ensemble cast although robert young playing an easy going <UNK> and very likable cop and robert mitchum who actually does have the occasional throwaway witty remark are the <UNK> stars of the film it's oscar <UNK> robert ryan and gloria <UNK> as well as paul kelly in the small but pivotal role of <UNK> pathetic husband who give the film's most memorable characterizations ryan proved so convincing as a homicidal racist that he was eventually <UNK> for a while <UNK> in equally villainous roles in such films as act of violence 1948 caught 1948 the <UNK> 1951 clash by night <UNK> the naked <UNK> 1953 and bad day at black rock 1955 the film is also notable for its <UNK> structure in that <UNK> flashback sequence a complete <UNK> is shot in a straightforward manner while the actual truth emerges from the <UNK> distorted <UNK> of the real protagonist of the film who furthermore isn't even played by any of the film's stars also <UNK> was originally to have treated homosexuality as per richard <UNK> original source novel the brick <UNK> but this taboo subject was <UNK> to the <UNK> office at the time a far cry from the situation we have today when at least 3 gay themed films are in the running for this <UNK> major oscars br br the print <UNK> for <UNK> dvd transfer shows some <UNK> signs of wear and tear at times but the audio commentary by noir experts james and <UNK> silver is a good one even though i don't happen to share their opinion that career <UNK> <UNK> after his <UNK> troubles as such excellent pictures as the sniper <UNK> the caine <UNK> 1954 broken lance 1954 the young lions 1958 <UNK> 1959 and <UNK> 1965 <UNK> prove having said that his <UNK> at rko with producer adrian scott and screenwriter john paxton murder my sweet 1944 <UNK> 1945 hopefully this will be part of the next film noir box set from <UNK> and <UNK> do <UNK> his best work in any case in my opinion the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s but also one of the finest <UNK> ever made period
<START> one of the two best films of the year a well filmed well written well put together film with an outstanding cast <UNK> <UNK> wan and his friends wong <UNK> <UNK> anthony wong sun francis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jordan chan <UNK> <UNK> cheung man <UNK> had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances <UNK> lee plays her comedic role well though much like a female version of michael wong her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes something i haven't done since 1 the fan boys took over <UNK> asian movies and 2 john <UNK> <UNK> sure the ending was expected but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members highly enjoyable
<START> thirty years after the 1939 classic film won robert an oscar and made <UNK> <UNK> a star goodbye mr <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> of problems before stumbling to the screen in this musical version original stars rex harrison and samantha <UNK> were replaced by richard burton and lee <UNK> who in turn were given the <UNK> ho in favor of thankfully peter o'toole and clark andre score was rejected and the one eventually used was composed by unfortunately leslie first time director herbert ross was handed the monumental task of <UNK> a simple love story that of a man for both his wife and students into a big budget <UNK> that it succeeds as well as it does despite the many obstacles in its way is a testament to its two stars br br arthur <UNK> is a latin teacher at a <UNK> school in suburban england where he himself was educated <UNK> and socially inept he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them prior to summer holiday a former student takes him to a london music hall to see an entertainment starring <UNK> bridges the young lady he hopes to <UNK> the post performance meeting is awkward for all and <UNK> as he is <UNK> known sets off to explore some of <UNK> ancient ruins unexpectedly he runs into <UNK> who has <UNK> a <UNK> cruise to allow her time to <UNK> a failed love affair and <UNK> the direction of her career in the time they spend together she discovers a kind and gentle man beneath the <UNK> exterior and upon returning to london <UNK> him in earnest when the fall term begins <UNK> returns to with his young bride and the two settle into a life of quiet <UNK> complications <UNK> when aspects of past surface and again when world war ii <UNK> in their lives but <UNK> is <UNK> by his wife's support and his new found confidence makes him a favorite among the students br br aside from a couple of musical <UNK> the delightful music hall production number london is london and <UNK> of love you and i most of songs some of them performed in voice over as the characters explore their emotions are easily forgettable and in no way enhance the film eliminate the score entirely and goodbye mr <UNK> works quite well as a drama <UNK> script <UNK> elements of the original while <UNK> upon it and <UNK> it by a couple of decades he has crafted several scenes between <UNK> and <UNK> that beautifully <UNK> their devotion to each other and <UNK> a few with comic relief courtesy of friend and <UNK> over the top actress ursula delightfully played by phillips <UNK> real life wife at the time he also captures life at a british public school the equivalent of a private academy here in the states with <UNK> perfection br br ross does well as a first time director <UNK> <UNK> the film with <UNK> photographed moments the opening credits sequence during which the school <UNK> echoes in the vast stone <UNK> of the school perfectly sets the tone for the film costumes and sets are true to the period the students portrayed by non professionals who were <UNK> at the school used as handle their various small supporting roles well br br highest praise is reserved for peter o'toole and clark in the lead roles o'toole was long established as a first class dramatic actor so his academy award nominated performance here comes as no surprise clark a veteran of some two dozen b movies in the uk and the previous year's <UNK> is absolutely <UNK> as the music hall <UNK> who a theatrical career in favor of life as a wife her golden voice <UNK> her songs and almost allows us to overlook how insipid most of them are and she more than matches o'toole in their dramatic scenes together the chemistry between the two is <UNK> and leaves us with no doubt that this is a couple very much in love br br this version of goodbye mr <UNK> is no classic like its predecessor but hardly the disaster many critics described when it was released ignore the score concentrate on the performances and <UNK> in the atmosphere ross has put on the screen it's a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love
<START> one of the <UNK> of my job is that when things are slow i can watch the movie in our <UNK> theater i work in a little 2 screen theater in the cry room and still keep an eye on the <UNK> stand i have seen italian job probably 20 times and i'm still not tired of it the atmosphere reminds me of <UNK> eleven although the acting isn't as good mark <UNK> is ok <UNK> <UNK> appeals to the guys but seth green is awesome in this movie i thought edward norton did a very good job playing a <UNK> although a lot of people disagree i also enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> expert that's afraid of dogs i highly recommend this movie and will continue to watch it whenever i can
<START> even though i tried to avoid german films recently positive reviews <UNK> me into renting this one there i stand fooled again by german media which has been <UNK> domestic flicks over and over again to me it is no wonder no one abroad wants to see this crap the idea to make this film is no idea at all i guess some fool read a women's magazine article about speed dating in short the characters which are none dialogue and content are so stunningly trivial trite and cliché ridden i continued watching because i could hardly believe what i saw btw to call the flat <UNK> <UNK> delivered by the figures certainly from the aforementioned magazines dialogue would be simply incorrect acting is so over the top i can't remember worse than that on screen in a long time you have to guess the director had has no clue at all amazingly <UNK> and producers around the country are still wondering why german films with rare exceptions generate no interest world wide why because it's waste of time and money
<START> is a b movie no doubt about it br br of course if you take a look at the cast <UNK> you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential this film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably don't know their names it's amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project almost like they decided to do a b movie actor reunion the cast even includes a couple of really first rate actors david warner who most people will recognize from <UNK> although my favorite of his roles is jack the <UNK> in <UNK> after <UNK> and lance <UNK> who many will remember as bishop in <UNK> these two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films br br however as impressive as this collection of actors is their talent is never fully <UNK> on the screen the writers of spent a lot of money to <UNK> a dream team cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor the common <UNK> of all b movies a silly script br br we start with a silly premise the bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to <UNK> the <UNK> and destroy the evidence but honestly why bother in the time it takes them to track down the film crew a thousand copies of that tape could be made and <UNK> to every law <UNK> agency and media <UNK> the criminals don't seem to realize how <UNK> their effort is and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original <UNK> is going to solve the whole problem silly but i suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no movie br br then there is the dialogue it is at times silly at times cliché and at times unbelievable everything you have come to expect from a b movie of course i have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material this cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved b movie status quite deservedly one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to <UNK> some life into their parts however it's disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot there's not much inspiration evident in these performances but then again it's an uninspiring script now i'll admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of <UNK> into the delivery of their lines but honestly even the very fine actors i mentioned earlier seem mostly <UNK> and <UNK> with the story br br speaking of the story even if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy it still would not redeem from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux <UNK> of low budget action movie scripts a plot with as many holes as a block of swiss cheese you can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't figure out how everything adds up in an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just don't fit anywhere and others that are missing i admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish there was so much that was never explained that i felt extremely frustrated at the end if you decide to watch it be prepared to be confused br br i haven't even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie but i won't bother the funny thing is that despite everything i've said i have to admit that i can't give 1 10 stars although i can't exactly put my finger on why i actually found this film to be somewhat likable the silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it plus i really like some of these character actors and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents i still got a kick out of seeing them br br now i realize i have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious <UNK> it's entirely possible i have completely missed the point it could be that the <UNK> intention all along was to make a b movie maybe the silliness is all completely intentional if that's the case and if i were to rate it on those terms i would have to say that is a classic in the genre of tongue in cheek action flicks b movie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film will get some chuckles from the script and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns explosions and chases
<START> this is a great comedy <UNK> what it was like to live next door to racist <UNK> but also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other based on the hit <UNK> comedy this is very politically incorrect and its all the better for it comedy after all is to entertain the movies only real <UNK> is there <UNK> much of a plot however the cast are as great as usual jack and <UNK> walker make one hell of a team playing off each other in a kind of way it's been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd the fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments means that i can recommend this movie just like i would of back in the 1970's
<START> starts off with fulci playing a version of himself writing down some ideas for how people could die followed by a fake looking cat eating what is presumably a brain the copy i watched was dubbed in english which i always hate but i was particularly disappointed not to get to hear fulci in his own voice br br fulci is in a sort of <UNK> state working on his latest horror movie his stomach turns when he sees things that resemble effects from his movie and he starts to that he is witnessing acts of horror he visits a psychiatrist who <UNK> him and unfortunately he does not have his improved mental health in mind i was reminded of the psychiatrist played by david <UNK> in clive <UNK> 1990 the shrink in this one is played by david l thompson who is pretty bad probably a real life friend of <UNK> he has a big <UNK> grin when he kills people though this may be <UNK> black humor at work which i thought was pretty poor too br br the movie is composed of a lot of clips from <UNK> movies either as if fulci is on the set directing them watching <UNK> on <UNK> or witnessing the acts i've never been too much of a fan of clip shows in tv series and i also think things like charles <UNK> full moon entertainment cutting their old films down and putting three such cuts together as new <UNK> are pretty lame i guess they need to make money br br the shrink in cat in the brain makes reference to the theory that violence in movies <UNK> violence in real life one of <UNK> co workers talks about having a documentary crew follow fulci to see what his life is like lots of self <UNK> stuff like this br br in the end some of the characters <UNK> away on a boat named <UNK>
<START> a <UNK> movie which should have been put to sleep forever that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time <UNK> of a film so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen it isn't even an achievement as a so bad it's good or so bad it's memorable movie the idea of <UNK> turning bad is intriguing but so little actually happens and so slowly that you feel your life <UNK> away while sitting there watching the non actors read their lines off cue cards waiting for their <UNK> <UNK> br br it's an empty hollow shell of a movie seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on unless you're both heavily <UNK> that's all i have to say br br avoid avoid avoid it will drive you <UNK> mad <UNK> get it <UNK> br br sorry i've had a rough week
<START> i suffered the watching of this movie at festival last month if there would be a possibility of a movie to avoid its existence this should be the first in the list <UNK> isn't a director she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout action makes her a professional film maker what a mistake the movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project val kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera his character don't have specific weight in the movie the same thing can tell about <UNK> <UNK> vincent <UNK> or <UNK> de <UNK> it's a shame the way <UNK> <UNK> character has been written warning spoilers br br he spends most of the time alone in the <UNK> talking with himself in the way now i'm doing this now i'm low of bats i'll search in my bag now i'm turning left now i'm turning right only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions it's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director end of spoilers br br the usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it zero
<START> a true comedy the dialog is fast and very witty <UNK> parker at her physical peak flynn as only flynn can be the charming although now past his prime most of the scenes between the principals are short so the movie moves well if you haven't seen this movie please give a look you will be surprised at <UNK> comedy timing the scenes between him tucker parker and <UNK> are hilarious just on the basis of the outfits worn by the most attractive parker this movie is worth a look the romance of this 40's movie will not be lost on those so inclined to watch movies from hollywood's golden past my bet is that never say goodbye won't disappoint
<START> isabelle <UNK> portrays a talented female piano teacher who is <UNK> <UNK> and distant in public and bitter towards her students <UNK> she <UNK> with violence and frustration and her sexual life is <UNK> and perverse she lives with her overbearing mother who <UNK> drives her to become noticed and so advance in life as a talented <UNK> the key to the characters of both mother and daughter is ' these characters cannot change their <UNK> anymore than a rabbit caught in <UNK> can avoid death br br the piano teacher meets a young attractive talented <UNK> who from the beginning is attracted to her they start a relationship in the most unconventional way but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her which <UNK> him enough to want to <UNK> the relationship before it has really begun br br the film ties itself to the female lead isabelle <UNK> <UNK> with a brutal completely convincing performance as the piano teacher she cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and <UNK> but her violence is fed by her perverted <UNK> as a film that is so character driven you know it would not work half as well had she acted poorly br br this is powerful intelligently acted and intelligently and <UNK> adapted from the novel the camera work also suits the film there are what i can only think to call framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to <UNK> about this is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall and is a further testament to the director's <UNK> br br expect to be disturbed and <UNK> by this film but be brave have the guts to go and see it this is a very private look into essentially one person's life but do not expect to be entertained in the hollywood sense there are no car chases in this film
<START> it is one of the best of stephen <UNK> i give it a nine out of ten br br i was surprised to see that shaolin soccer was rated on top of all movies unbelievable
<START> i was so offended by this film that i had to write something about it so please humour me br br its only redeeming virtue outside of some good acting is that it doesn't go on past <UNK> minutes even that length is about 30 minutes too long br br comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark 'the <UNK> ' but i can't see it they are two different films altogether the closest comes to an existing film is 'the <UNK> ' made in 1973 it borrows sorry steals <UNK> from this splendid george roy hill ' which is exactly what is was i enjoyed it because it didn't pretend to be anything else br br there are so many red herrings in that i thought i was in a fish tank it's very confusing but that's only one of its many problems the principal one is this if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else where everyone is <UNK> we have no to ground us the inevitable result is a <UNK> mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks br br just about everyone in this film is conniving and <UNK> surely a basic film 101 class would tell us that the audience has to <UNK> for someone we can't <UNK> for anyone here they're all it might have worked as a <UNK> comedy but it plays it straight from beginning to end br br if you want to see this film read no further big <UNK> coming sorry but i have to do it br br there's so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesn't strain <UNK> it destroys it the ending is absolutely ridiculous a <UNK> in a crowded airport that isn't really a <UNK> at all and the <UNK> guy blood <UNK> simply stands up <UNK> himself off and walks away fake blood dripping with the <UNK> all while the police and <UNK> of people are looking on and no one <UNK> the director must have a lot of <UNK> if he thinks we're supposed to buy into this <UNK> b movies from the 1940s did better br br i'm a great fan of european flicks but this <UNK> that schlock doesn't always come from hollywood as far as is concerned my judgment lies with a famous line from the <UNK> producer samuel <UNK> who knew all about schlock me <UNK>
<START> jean hugh <UNK> is excellent as the <UNK> boy who wants to be a whore to please the man he loves but the rest of this film is so bad acting writing cinematography and everything else that performance is wasted sad to see so fine an actor in such a garbage flick
<START> this truly is an australia cult classic if you're one of the lucky ones to have seen it then you are very lucky it has been released in most countries but not in australia for some reason i have a copy on dvd from the uk not a great transfer but i bought it having seen it previously at a film festival the directing is spot on and the performances rock this is dark film scary film but often times very funny in parts i urge you to see this film there is a <UNK> about this you don't see in 99 of the typical aussie fare the screenplay is very well crafted and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly but until the last ten minutes you just can't pick how badly great work from the four leads especially <UNK> <UNK> br br when its all said and done great work on display
<START> i have just watched this movie for the first time today and just loved it br br yes it is simple in it's storyline the <UNK> love story and how any female could not fall in love with <UNK> blue beats me br br the scenery in italy was as you would expect beautiful the baddies lost in the end and for the two <UNK> to be reunited at the end was wonderful but that scene where a certain italian was sweeping away the <UNK> after eric and <UNK> wedding perfection br br have a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie yes better have a <UNK> ready and be enthralled i know i was and hope to get it on dvd real soon all the actors played their parts perfectly this was a ww2 film you could believe in as it was so realistic and without going over the top as in other films
<START> i was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week he told me it was so bad that i had to see it so i went on an <UNK> site and bought the film this is probably the worst film i have ever seen it makes you laugh when it really shouldn't terrible acting and terrible storyline plus he looks nothing like michael jackson br br i still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see van <UNK> is a joke in this film br br robots cant <UNK> psyche br br i have to say though the special effects are actually amazing psyche dvds were probably even out when this film came out but if i had my way it would be a straight to vhs release yes people it is that bad
<START> i have never fallen asleep whilst watching a movie before br br i did with this one br br avoid at all costs give your time and money to a worthy cause instead
<START> let me start by saying that <UNK> has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut everything is <UNK> anyone who has read the book knows how <UNK> the story is with nonsensical and hilarious <UNK> by alex along with countless flashback scenes and crazy <UNK> sequences <UNK> took all of this and made it work the movie itself is great the soundtrack the performances the cinematography it all works there is a lot of story missing about the town and its inhabitants but there's only so much you can do with an indie so this part of it didn't bother me too much it's just disappointing that not a lot of people will see this movie or even know that it exists because of the lack of promotion that came with it i didn't even know it was in theatres i didn't know when the dvd came out you'd think that since <UNK> <UNK> was one of the main characters somebody <UNK> at least released a commercial for it i had to see the trailer on my paradise now dvd released on dvd in the spring of <UNK> to even know that it had a fall of 2005 theatrical release date haha sad really br br anyhow if you stumble across this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and are <UNK> that you see it take my advice and watch it it's a very good experience br br 8 out of 10
<START> giant robot was the most popular japanese tv serial ever seen on indian tv it was targeted to children and we saw a robot for the first time in our life br br many indian children must have even seen a machine for the first time outside the school <UNK> br br the serial also showed a child in an adults organization fighting evil no doubt many of us who have seen giant robot in our childhood long for our own robots and as a <UNK> look upon our computers in the same way br br this show also portrayed ideal adults referring at jerry <UNK> buddy friend and <UNK> chief <UNK> we grew to respect japanese progress and still view japan as the ideal asian nation br br btw at that time there were no satellite tv channels in india and the <UNK> owned <UNK> did not show much of disney cartoons i guess that was how child serials like giant robot got appreciated nowadays there is pokemon etc but they are no so fascinating or <UNK> as giant robot
<START> the premise of this movie is the guy is married and yet everyone on this site seems to think yeah this is funny cute and a good movie what the hell what is funny about immature girls <UNK> with a married man with a new baby what is cute about the fact that he is cheating on his wife what have been wrong with them finding some teenage boys to have sex with before starting college <UNK> that is not good enough the guy has to be married off limits off the market that's the one we gotta have dumb ass girls then one of the girls decides that she loves the guy no she just loves the way he makes her feel two of the girls are having fun with it they think it is funny and no one seems to have any moral problems with what they are doing it just shameless but yeah this is all good with everyone one this website the dark haired girl even has the <UNK> to have her dad pick her up from the guys house under the <UNK> of baby sitting this is a morally disgusting movie and where is the wife poor woman working and paying the bills while he <UNK> the baby <UNK>
<START> i still remember when frog baseball first aired on mtv in some sort of odd surreal manner the cartoon captured the stupid actions that i think every boy growing up in america <UNK> in i cringe now thinking about how i burned a crippled <UNK> using a <UNK> glass but it was interesting at the time for some reason growing up in the 1980s we all knew <UNK> these were the kids who wore iron maiden t shirts to school grew their hair long had immature <UNK> and were at least two <UNK> <UNK> than everyone else because they had <UNK> a grade or two we laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned so it was easy to understand <UNK> co because we already knew them some of us were even them to the extent that like myself would <UNK> the excess of the 1980s and embrace the <UNK> movement of the 1990s <UNK> co were sort of a strange post modern <UNK> for us strange because like <UNK> co we didn't care if we had an <UNK> it was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful
<START> being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary i was eager to see how the subject matter was handled unfortunately the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history this film only concerns itself with the period within new york city ignoring the rest of the country while i spent a fair amount of time in nyc at that time i can assure you that there was a gay life outside manhattan the men interviewed here are the same a list queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 70s and here they are again <UNK> nostalgic and still throwing attitude the film should have at least tried to cover larger topics such as race the <UNK> gay <UNK> system based on wealth body image and the rise of the <UNK> <UNK> of sub groups within the community and the ability to grow a decent mustache which was very important in the 70s alas we have none of this presented and the <UNK> of those interviewed are no different than my own memories if you were there in that decade you'll enjoy the <UNK> photos and grainy home movies of the bars and <UNK> we haunted if you weren't there this film will undoubtedly seem dull it should have been so much more but sadly it's not two stars for <UNK> my memory i still miss going to the <UNK>
<START> sigh what can i say br br why does a horrible script such as this gets <UNK> in the first place its not wrong to have a complicated plot but its not explained to the audience properly br br to have the wife explain the plot via flashbacks is bad bad bad to have such a tight editing for the fight scenes is bad too such <UNK> editing only appears in trailers it <UNK> the whole look br br and who are the russian guys at the top of the movie who is the guy being tortured is he with the cia br br this film deserved not to be released in theatre but it doesn't deserve to be produced in the first place its a joke to hollywood
<START> wish it would be released as i would love to see the finished product we saw the unfinished version before it came out loved all the characters and actors anyone know if it is out on video yet would love to see it again definitely worth renting if it's not going to be shown in the theatre i had a hard time finding it because they <UNK> it
<START> why is it better because it's true to the dark vision of the comic because the imagery is inventive and unlike the first there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one the first one had too much of jack <UNK> <UNK> too much prince music and an awkward romance here instead of one villain there are three no robert <UNK> and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face in fact pfeiffer is the 1 attraction of this film her transformation is what drives the running theme <UNK> on the edge of sanity and insanity good and evil she becomes truly <UNK> the costumes and makeup are excellent danny <UNK> penguin is inspired and <UNK> not just a nut his circus gang <UNK> is the one element of comic relief besides that giant duck max shrek is the only character i'd have toned down walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman danny <UNK> score is a perfect fit as usual and the <UNK> and the <UNK> song face to face is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack the least campy of the films it is macabre doesn't <UNK> and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride bravo tim burton and cast
<START> this is absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen i hope the real family and other portrayed characters have lawyers <UNK> the hell out of <UNK> for there portrayal the acting is horrible the writing is worse and the portrayal of characters is scary its supposed to be a drama but it was a comedy to me you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting i usually like <UNK> <UNK> acting but this time he has completely missed the mark br br you could argue he took this role for a couple of laughs himself because it was so horrible if you really want a dramatic movie for the night do not choose this one but if you are in for some laughs over bad acting and stupid writing tune in other than that don't waste your time
<START> the regard of flight and the clown as performed by bill irwin are some of the funniest both in terms of physical comedy and verbal and visual gags performances i've ever seen my father taped this special when it first aired in the 80s and my family has loved it ever since we quote it back and forth fairly constantly it's a crying shame that copies are not readily available for purchase i have a bad vhs copy that i acquired from a <UNK> <UNK> a few years ago but mr <UNK> performance deserves a proper dvd treatment with a restored version of the original performance and interviews with the performers producers as well as more examples of modern <UNK> br br bill <UNK> talent deserves more exposure to mainstream audiences than it has enjoyed in his limited wide release appearances i share the regard of flight with friends quite often and though i am always <UNK> with a small amount of <UNK> when i mention that it is a mixture of <UNK> and vaudeville i have yet to have anyone come away from seeing it without loving it in case the powers that be ever happen upon this imdb listing please consider releasing this and other bill irwin work
<START> i haven't seen any other films by antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of his works maybe if i had seen other stuff by him i would have enjoyed this one knowing what to expect br br i saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons first of all the film introduces interesting deep issues about social relationships feelings the nature of reality versus fiction but this is very often done in the of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches rambling on and on <UNK> <UNK> rather than having dialogues the <UNK> seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing br br secondly the movie has no rhythm especially in its first half it is not only that it is slow some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm el <UNK> by victor or <UNK> the age of innocence are examples i like but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging or the story so moving that we can adapt to it this does not happen in beyond the clouds where the first episode seems to drag endlessly and the relationship between john reality and the love stories fiction is at times fluid others abrupt others confusing
<START> this appalling piece of tripe was conveniently loosely based on a true story that involved two family members of mine played by jack thompson and <UNK> <UNK> br br this film is offensive besides the fact that it wasn't a particular good film anyway it does not in any way capture what it was like to lose such a close family member and completely <UNK> those who were really affected by the true life tragedy br br as for the director he managed to cash in on a family's misfortune for the price of a <UNK> br br if i could have given this a zero i would have br br avoid this film at all costs
<START> what can i say i got up this morning and turned on sci fi and watched half of the first season and figured it all out strange unusual and brilliant it gives all potential and to think at first i said this looks stupid this has got to be the next best thing since x files but as always nothing will ever take down that show in my opinion i am telling you it's scary and then suspenseful and then <UNK> towards the end you have miles as a love puppy with a weird pet that is a new species you have two people on the run from authorities and a killer <UNK> about to strike wow and did i mention miles pet is a potential killer well the rest of his species is surface is a brilliant show with <UNK> and twists that delivers it all
<START> well well even if you're a <UNK> admirer of <UNK> silent films this early one the first part of a two part unfinished four part serial will leave you in doubt about <UNK> narrative skills his directorial skills aren't that evident either but here and there one senses his talent for building up atmosphere br br the just pure juvenile nonsense which wouldn't be half as bad were it not for the long <UNK> stretches in between the childish action scenes br br but the whole affair almost gets by on its <UNK> innocence br br 4 out of 10 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> predator island starts as six friends eric tom <UNK> chris dan gordon along with heather <UNK> grace kim baker denise melissa <UNK> get invited to spend sometime on <UNK> michael father's boat <UNK> in the open sea what could go wrong with such a super sounding idea well for starters a big green <UNK> could crash into the sea near your boat an alien life force could emerge from it try to kill all of you then again that's just a ridiculously stupid idea isn't it br br co edited written directed by steven castle i thought predator island was crap it's a simple straight forward as that really the script is of the worst kind you know the sort of abomination that's full of highly annoying teenage character's who do say the most stupid things it's full of clichés is utterly predictable it makes next to no sense things just suddenly happen without any build up or explanation it's boring even at only 70 odd minutes it has virtually no entertainment value whatsoever not even unintentional laugh value the film doesn't really have much of what i would call a plot there's no explanation given as to why or how this alien creature can take over people's minds or why it can be <UNK> in the sense that one moment the person will be <UNK> the next when the story calls for it with no apparent cause they suddenly get green glowing eyes a sudden urge to turn cannibal there's not enough horror in it the so called action scenes are pitiful i really don't want to waste another second thinking about predator island let alone wasting my precious energy <UNK> these words br br director castle doesn't do anything to make this thing watchable the <UNK> <UNK> are absolutely terrible this alien creature dude wouldn't even get into a 50's sci fi film the filmmakers even play some <UNK> footage over the end credits but this has to be the least funny collection of mistakes ever i mean they can't even get it wrong right if you know what i mean forget about any decent gore as there isn't any there's a bit of <UNK> some intestines placed on the unfortunate actors stomach so another unfortunate actor can pick them up pretend to eat them br br with a supposed budget of about 150 000 i have to <UNK> that the filmmakers were working on a seriously low budget that's still no excuse for making such a poor film the whole thing looks very cheap the acting is pretty bad br br predator island is crap i'm sorry but that's the way it is i just fail to see what anyone would get out of it in my humble opinion this probably one to avoid
<START> i <UNK> this as the worst movie of all time br br if there ever was a movie i would wish upon my enemies this would be it the plot is ridiculous there are only 2 characters and the <UNK> between these characters just completely strain belief br br these factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie br br my wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in i figured that a movie this boring and slow must have some cool interesting plot twist and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting <UNK> br br i briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life
<START> i've seen this film three times and each time i appreciate it more i think <UNK> <UNK> should have received an emmy nomination for her real and natural performance many of us who were age at this time the story takes place will understand how real it is life for most of us is neither <UNK> glowing romantic or <UNK> cynical <UNK> it is a <UNK> balance and this film captures this balance it is well constructed too with so many fine details in its composition like the film or not judging from the extraordinarily high ratings it gets from the <UNK> of females under 18 we can know that this movie reveals some important truth about how young women see themselves in the world
<START> night hunter is a sold b style action movie get a life and grow up people don the dragon wilson is a kick boxer hall of fame and not an actor if your looking for an oscar it's not here brother looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget this is it the plot line may have been a little thin but what b movie isn't i understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure get real people judging every movie like it is an oscar <UNK> just silly awesome fight scenes mixed with a new twist on vampire moves see it if your a fan rent something else if your a <UNK>
<START> first time i saw this great movie and <UNK> my star playing frances ella <UNK> was so great in this movie it was just so real and her little dog so cute i saw it the first time when i was like 11 years old and it was the best movie i had ever seen and you know what i still think so 10 10 greatest ever
<START> not every line in a comedy is funny this movie takes a serious subject the of voters and holds it up to the light while telling jokes about it it's the movie the daily show would have made if they wanted to turn it into a movie i found robin williams to be much funnier in this movie than he was in <UNK> and while my wife and i share a few <UNK> political views we were both <UNK> over in laughter for several parts of this movie the script writers here could give fox news some lessons in fair and balanced lewis black was okay for his part but never really seemed to be able to bring out his particular brand of comedy for his role christopher walken was also good playing his fairly common subdued supporting role pushing a story along
<START> i just don't know how this stupid crap junk garbage good for nothing film is a blockbuster it was so boring with a very very weak or no story line and wasn't even a <UNK> funny the film was about <UNK> minutes of only a paragraph of story about <UNK> salman khan is a love guru and is helping hapless romantic govinda to get the girl he wants i'm not saying that i didn't like the film because it wasn't funny or anything i will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story the only two reasons why i can say it's a super hit are br br 1 salman khan govinda are on screen together but there first time together was in <UNK> e <UNK> which was a flop so it can't be but it was a really good movie br br 2 salman <UNK> name is <UNK> and all the films with that name have been a hit including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so it's just luck br br i heard that it's a remake of <UNK> i've not seen it i'm glad i didn't music is ok the only good songs are do you want a partner you're my love <UNK> de but what is the use of it in a really bad film that too if you have someone like <UNK> <UNK> who dances with two left feet she is completely crap neither she knows acting language her voice is always dubbed for her dance and always fails to impress i do not like her one bit she was even disappointing in <UNK> with <UNK> overall partner is a <UNK> film with a <UNK> actress <UNK> <UNK> its better off that she is kicked out of bollywood and never comes back again
<START> if this film is examined closely it's a bit sad it is detailed enough to touch upon very real problems children who grow up in poor dysfunctional <UNK> yet it <UNK> it's comedic value with spirited performances by <UNK> <UNK> and james earl jones the sadness lies in the struggles and <UNK> of the mother <UNK> who cannot truly help her children not because she doesn't want to or try but because it's obvious she doesn't know how remember this is a comedy but if you've never seen this or if you have watch this film and see the humanity in the characters good film
<START> this movie just screened on channel seven australian tv today br br in my opinion it was a very interesting take on how the <UNK> treated the russian jews as mercilessly as everywhere else br br <UNK> martin did a really great job and her tears and frustration as were quite convincing br br the holocaust is a part of our history that we must not forget <UNK> list wasn't the first and it wont be the last account of survival and courage in that five year nightmare my family is dutch and i will always applaud any movie makers who want to keep the <UNK> alive by telling of someone's courage to stand up and help those who were being abused <UNK> and murdered for being a jew
<START> compared to battle of britain this is a real film with real characters and a real plot battle of britain is basically a documentary with the occasional lawrence olivier and michael caine but the real protagonists are the <UNK> the <UNK> etc here on the other hand you have two well <UNK> characters actually three and a real plot i strongly recommend it to anybody even to those who are not particularly fond of war movies it's well filmed and i wonder what the director might do if he had the big <UNK> behind him and i do not think that it's over sentimental it's only that in the fighters you have real people with real feelings and a real life as real as any fictional life in any great film
<START> how to round up every possible cliché and stereotype existing in the genre of horror and then subsequently stuff them into one <UNK> lousy movie the answer camp blood this is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a <UNK> budget and a little bit too obvious inspired by friday the 13th four of the most <UNK> teenage characters you'll ever see  they're like a combination of ugly stupid and annoying  go camping and quickly find themselves pursued by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit don't even ask me what the killer's motivations were or even who he she was because if it did feature in the film i totally missed it this is one of the worst movies ever made with no inspiration or <UNK> whatsoever the production values were so <UNK> that there are actors playing multiple roles without even bothering to make them <UNK> the only half decent and worthwhile sequence throughout the whole of camp blood is the opening in which the <UNK> <UNK> meredith o'brien has sex in the woods with her geeky boy <UNK> yes i'm fully aware that this is a totally shallow remark to make but then again this is a juvenile and retarded film so who cares
<START> what could have been a good story was destroyed by the ludicrous time travel scenario if something was altered in the past that changed evolution and humans never developed the time machine would never have been built if something from the past was brought into the present it would have no effect on the past br br i really wish film producers would run their ideas past an actual scientist before finishing the script even if you suspend reality and assume time travel is possible you have to stick to logic br br <UNK> ben kingsley seemed to be having a great time with his over the top performance all of the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could as well it was the writing that left them <UNK> in the wind br br back to the future handled it better
<START> i saw this film last night br br and i'm worried i'm turning into one of those left wing <UNK> they rightly make fun of in south park because i found it hugely offensive am i being ridiculously sensitive firstly there's the old <UNK> that is america being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything ever br br secondly and <UNK> there is the early meteor strike hitting some <UNK>  why do they need a name asian country the reaction to this is to look at it as a warning as in my god imagine the tragedy that could happen because you know it happened to <UNK> it might happen to white americans and that would be tragic br br then later on a bigger meteor hits paris our cast on the ground are irritated because this might mean our boys have less time than they thought not much upset in america no mention that a lot of people have died br br then there's michael clarke <UNK> a wonderful actor wasted never has a black man been so token among a team of hardcore <UNK> his job seems to consist of standing in the back occasionally saying hey you da man really why did they even bring him it's not like he's <UNK> he <UNK> down that <UNK> for nothing not once does he lift a tool steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows up br br even if you ignore the russian peter <UNK> another great actor wasted in a pointless role who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with instead of <UNK> them because how we do in russia it's pretty horrific br br all <UNK> of course by the site of blond blue eyed american children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant br br you expect the bad script the dodgy acting the implausible plot fat middle aged men being trained in 12 days to be <UNK> including one who appears to be retarded but i couldn't believe the racism and <UNK> implied in the film and the <UNK> disregard for the lives of anyone not corn fed american br br it's a chilling <UNK> of the attitude of a section of western society to the world br br and it's a crappy film too
<START> watched the director's cut last night glad it was free rental even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at film noir the <UNK> modern <UNK> were annoying to me not clever seeming more like budget constraints than anything else the non traditional casting i also found distracting if i have to stop following the story to wonder what the heck is the black chick drag queen doing there then the <UNK> has failed me again not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating and very film school final project ish and for <UNK> sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color there was no use of nuance in the lighting no shades of gray no depth no <UNK> just black and just white boring
<START> i must say this is easily one of my favorite movies to watch on halloween the halloween party the horrid acting the guy dressed like and extra from miami vice great great great br br spoilers br br i have a huge place in my heart for random 80's horror flicks and this one reached out and <UNK> at my heart strings i always passes this flick at blockbuster and always laughed at the cover of the box now every weekend i would grab a random movie i had never seen before one weekend it was turn she seemed to have been <UNK> me for months so i took it home put it in and spent most of the movie underneath the <UNK> br br for me it was terrifying and gross and not just the acting some of the things they came up with for this movie was amazing i can honestly say the best part for me was watching suzanne played by a fellow stick a tube of <UNK> through her <UNK> it was random and i loved it watching creepy angela <UNK> through the <UNK> and hearing her creepy demon voice was enough to have me awake all night long br br it isn't one of the most clever or best acted horror movies but its 80's cheese and its got all the elements you need creepy <UNK> kid virgin slut naked girls scary house bad acting oh and did i mention naked girls all the elements were there and were put together in such a way that made for one of my <UNK> movies kudos to the filmmakers
<START> this is the one movie that represents all that is bad in the movie business the actors are pathetic and the script is awful the special effects if there are any are so badly done that it would have been better to do it with cartoons instead besides that it's great i think the creators of the movie meant it to have humor but the only time i was laughing was when i saw patrick s with long hair and the colorful costumes that every one had the scenes at the end were good but they were not a part of the movie in the end you will ask yourself why did i waste my time and money with that crap when i could have watched the plants growing or the clouds moving i don't think that i am some critic or anything but this is a truly lame movie do not watch danger of stupidity <UNK>
<START> after the book i became very sad when i was watching the movie i am agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel but in this case it was more than acceptable some examples br br 1 why the ranks are different e g lt instead of sergeant etc br br 2 the final screen is very poor and makes as a soldier who <UNK> up himself and wants to die but it is not true in 100 just read the book he was a bull dog in the last seconds as well he did not want to die by <UNK> his gun and walking simply towards to michael <UNK> br br so this is some kind of a happy end which does not fit at all for this movie
<START> i have no read the novel on which the <UNK> runner is based my wife and daughter who did thought the movie fell a long way short of the book and i'm prepared to take their word for it but on its own the movie is good not great but good how accurately does it portray the havoc created by the soviet invasion of afghanistan how convincingly does it show the <UNK> <UNK> regime that followed i'd rate it c on the first and b on the second the human story the <UNK> american who returned to the country to rescue the son of his childhood <UNK> is well done but it is on this count particularly that i'm told the book was far more convincing than the movie the most exciting part of the film however the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and later a mini contest in california cannot have been <UNK> by the book i'd <UNK> money on that

<START> i thought this movie was highly underrated the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and i was put off at first but once i was watching the movie it didn't seem strange at all i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and i couldn't wait to find out how it would end once it did end i thought about it for a long time after i was pleased with everything about k <UNK> from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the ending it's not an especially upbeat or happy film though it does make you chuckle from time to time but i found it to be especially entertaining and thought provoking i own it now and intend to watch it many times
<START> the only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in ny during as for the film itself it has at least three major flaws first of all there is narration throughout the film which is not required at all in the few places where there is some explanation necessary just adding a little dialogue would have gone a long way secondly there was no obvious attempt to <UNK> any of the audio in fact it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later with no attempt to match the film the third flaw was in the ending i will not give the ending away for those brave souls that would endure the torture of sitting through the film but it commits a <UNK> sin in <UNK> not worth the money or time it takes to see this unless you are a fan of one of the represented bands
<START> last night i attended a screening of with my cousin we were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director writer the producer his wife and several cast members were also in <UNK> and that there would be a discussion and q a after the movie but once the movie was over and the credits started rolling and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long my cousin and i without <UNK> each other immediately got up and left we found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion we couldn't even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left br br i have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which jerry <UNK> his daughter palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail it was <UNK> to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence <UNK> her and taking her with him when he <UNK> i've <UNK> my palm before accidentally even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive and it is very slow to <UNK> if you don't keep it <UNK> because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life but after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band aid it was as if she'd never been cut my anger reached its peak i won't spoil this moment for you in final scene br br i got angry because <UNK> is by far the most sympathetic character in the film the actress portraying her is a good one i you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know in feeling both her physical and emotional pain and the screenwriter by treating emotional pain so and with such <UNK> also treated me the audience member and with utter <UNK> br br sure the script has moments of tears for <UNK> and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting somewhere somehow but by this time we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down the manipulation starts very early on in this movie when <UNK> family's dialogue spells out for the audience that jerry had psychiatric problems rule one screenwriters give your audience some credit let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own tell the story don't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel we don't like it br br my cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on dialogue wise when jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides f this f that f you some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths but it's like watching comedians who curse a lot some of them are really funny the <UNK> is <UNK> but some of them substitute <UNK> for humor and this screenwriter to carry the metaphor to its conclusion is no chris rock br br this husband and wife team <UNK> chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters but they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story especially a complex one will <UNK> for each member of the audience successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience br br i worked with vietnam veterans for five years i've heard more stories than most and i'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a <UNK> audience it's important on all kinds of different levels that we hear them but i am less than thrilled that this <UNK> decided before the film even began what <UNK> story meant and <UNK> to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand next time pay more attention to the details
<START> i rank opera as one of the better <UNK> films plot holes and inconsistencies sure but i don't think they this film as much as many other reviewers seem to a lot of elements that are in many of <UNK> films are kinda off the wall but that's part of the draw of his films br br short story psycho stalks the new leading lady the typical <UNK> twists and turns ensue leading up to a decent payoff of a climax not <UNK> best but i still pull this one out from time to time definitely worth a look if you like his other stuff just don't get this one mixed up with the abysmal phantom of the opera remake that <UNK> did that one is truly awful 8 10
<START> <UNK> a life in four chapters is an art house biography about <UNK> <UNK> celebrated japanese writer who bears resemblance to paul <UNK> earlier character travis <UNK> taxi driver both of them are lonely people searching for their place in their society and when they realize that world doesn't need them they try to destroy their surrounding universe br br if you want to learn about life of <UNK> then you won't find a lot of information here because it shows that he didn't live a very interesting life except for his final day but if you want to understand his personality then it is the best movie of its kind as most of the movie is adaptation of his novels and also provides a guide to his thoughts this movie shows that <UNK> was a person who witnessed the fall of japanese culture which he was very fond of and with his final act he tried to save traditions and prove to himself that he is a real warrior but he realized that as a person he was just a man with no power to change the events
<START> the movie doesn't take itself seriously and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody and your horror topped with extra cheese br br this film <UNK> an eye at every horror fan and then gives them the finger it knows it sucks and because of that it's far and away the best of the child's play series br br it plays up the <UNK> humor angle so well you find yourself doing more than just laughing at it but with it and trust me the whole time you're laughing it's laughing back br br
<START> <UNK> would have to rate as one of the ten worst films i have ever seen the writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and i'm sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film br br it fails to work either as a tribute to <UNK> unique talent or as an accurate account of his short life br br a pointless mess with no redeeming features
<START> marked for death 1990 spends more time on action sequences than it does with focusing on its characters after his first two impressive efforts above the law 1988 and hard to kill 1989 this third steven seagal picture makes the idea clear anyone who <UNK> him is meant to look like a fool the bad guys are just there to make him look good br br seagal had been <UNK> building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick 'em up antics of chuck norris or jean claude van damme br br in marked for death seagal <UNK> aside any <UNK> at style and heads full <UNK> into exploitation this film contains loads of graphic violence gore and nudity that seem to be there for no reason other than to please <UNK> <UNK> who are unable to <UNK> between action pictures that tell a story and those that simply pour on the thrills without rhyme or reason and he deserves some real blame for this <UNK> in taste as a producer of marked for death br br seagal plays john <UNK> a retired <UNK> agent who comes home to chicago where his family is being attacked by a <UNK> street gang who attack his sister's house and the film proves that it isn't <UNK> when <UNK> niece <UNK> harris is shot in the <UNK> <UNK> gets mad and he decides to team up with his old friend max keith david a school gym teacher and charles tom wright a <UNK> cop br br naturally <UNK> declares war on the chief bad guy a dread locked <UNK> voodoo priest called basil wallace a <UNK> that apparently means outrageous overacting br br and it is almost unbelievable in the way seagal picks off various members of the gang he <UNK> one guy's <UNK> he breaks a guy's back and he breaks numerous arms and limbs br br all logic for this movie is thrown out the window through the glass that is why aren't <UNK> and friends <UNK> for all the property damage they cause or the body count that <UNK> up and how did they get their <UNK> of automatic weapons from <UNK> to by plane without being <UNK> br br seagal has a clint eastwood <UNK> about him that fans once seemed to enjoy and despite the three different characters he's played in as many films each dresses in oriental black and wears a <UNK> one of the problems that i have with some of <UNK> movies is that the main characters never seem to be in serious <UNK> and because he's the star of course no one can lay a <UNK> on him except for the bad guy br br <UNK> heroes are all <UNK> as are most of the plot lines and action sequences regardless of whether he's <UNK> as a <UNK> cook a fire fighter or an l a cop wearing love <UNK> seagal is always seagal which is exactly what his fans want in fact the of these films is such that if i wanted to i could take an old review change the names and have a reasonably accurate take on the new movie not that i'd ever really do that
<START> lucio fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him <UNK> the title 'the godfather of <UNK> while don't torture a <UNK> was made before fulci became well known amongst <UNK> and isn't all that gory it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller and for my money the best film that fulci ever made don't torture a <UNK> really is head and shoulders above a lot of the giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of <UNK> later films everything about this giallo is great the plot focuses on a small <UNK> community where dead bodies have began turning up the murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes a reporter named <UNK> arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own soon encounters various suspects including a sexy young lady named patricia a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax <UNK> and sticking <UNK> into them br br while this film may not feature loads of gore it does have two of <UNK> <UNK> sequences to make up for it the <UNK> involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is <UNK> to turn some <UNK> don't torture a <UNK> features an absolutely great italian cast barbara <UNK> a personal favourite of mine is incredibly sexy in her role as patricia and gets to <UNK> her acting <UNK> more than she did in many later films <UNK> is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of irene <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and marc <UNK> the cinematography on display is stunning and fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene the story plays out slowly and it's always interesting as fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line there isn't a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer but fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and don't torture a <UNK> does climax on a high overall it's a shame that fulci didn't make more films like this don't torture a <UNK> is his out and out best work and i insist that every giallo fans sees it
<START> if you see this film in the tv <UNK> just ignore it if you're looking for something scary you'll be better off watching reruns of the x files br br previous comments <UNK> the incredibly poor acting by the female lead are dead on she is almost unwatchable the sum total of her range includes and and and not br br i am the kind of movie buff who enjoys a good <UNK> movie but this is ridiculous there is no direction the plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers they keep throwing at you and much like that set of numbers it ends up having no meaning in the end br br your time will be better spent if you turn off the tv and give your dog a bath
<START> not the best plot in the world but the comedy in this movie rules <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful in this movie another funny guy is rob schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with ken hudson campbell who plays lauren holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as lt lake bruce dern is a great actor in this movie playing probably the most serious character in the movie the actor i liked the most was toby as <UNK> all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious br br plot is a little uneven about lt commander tom dodge who for years has wanted to command his own sub when he finally gets the chance instead of a brand new sub he gets a rusty wwii <UNK> sub the <UNK> his crew isn't any better <UNK> of the u s navy he is then put in a series of war games that shows how an old <UNK> engine can handle itself against the current nuclear navy things still don't get any better when he finds out his dive officer is actually a female officer to see how women do on actual <UNK> to get the commander position he wants he has to win the war games and blow up a <UNK> ship br br the movie <UNK> quite well in fact i laughed non stop when i saw this movie in theaters i loved when they were in silence and <UNK> and <UNK> reaction to the smell is hilarious br br overall 9 out of 10 this movie is just plain fun to watch it nice to have a movie like this i hate movies that try to be 100 serious
<START> this film offers many <UNK> and surprises when and <UNK> beautifully sing a <UNK> from don <UNK> that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film the story unfolds in 18th century <UNK> and the use of period music played on period <UNK> is just one more fine touch you share general exquisite joy in his <UNK> of the en even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small <UNK> to <UNK> br br <UNK> is an artist whose medium is food perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share her creations so directly br br the main theme of this movie the potential that the sharing of food has to <UNK> how people see each other and how they see the world is much the same as the theme of but <UNK> feast does not hit you over the head with its message the <UNK> are conservative <UNK> but not <UNK> oppressive you come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity br br many issues are raised for you to reflect on the nature of art the <UNK> of paths taken and paths not taken the relationship between the spiritual and the physical the effect of environment on behavior the taking of life to give life among others br br the only disappointment for me was general speech delivered at the climax of the meal i expected deep heartfelt observations but i got some vague mystical <UNK> the speech had such a minimal impact that i hardly remember it br br but this understated film leaves a lasting impression the warmth it <UNK> is in contrast to its <UNK> backdrop you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars
<START> i found the film quite good for what i was expecting although i weary because i have a fear of <UNK> <UNK> i sort of came to expect when they were coming so if you're not into <UNK> blood the human body and some good medical fun put this movie back and rent another as the other user commented i was also please at the german attempt at a slasher film i'm an american who just moved to germany to stay with a family and saw this lying on the shelf i love psychological thrillers and i'd say this is somewhere along those lines a character falls into places and feels <UNK> while trying to dig her way out and find some truth to a situation things get a little <UNK> and other aren't so sure she's on the right track so throughout the film you're kept on edge about who's <UNK> you might catch a glimpse of and who's <UNK> the next corner
<START> for those of us who are part of the real world of ballet this film is completely ridiculous <UNK> <UNK> was basically a <UNK> not a ballet dancer <UNK> at the time was with ballet theater now american ballet theater and a reasonably good dancer but except for dame <UNK> anderson the acting is amateurish and is completely over the top embarrassingly so i saw this film at age 14 and at that time never having seen a ballet i was very impressed however later in life long after i had completed my own career as a dancer i purchased the video tape of it curious as to what it was like after so many years i couldn't believe how naive hollywood could be about the world of ballet but it was made in the mid 40s before the red shoes or the turning point the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world the entire cast of <UNK> have now passed away <UNK> <UNK> not his real name dying at age <UNK> it was his one and only film thereafter being kept by a chicago business man so the <UNK> goes
<START> this film <UNK> set piece suffers from murky sound at least as shown on the <UNK> equipment of both the seattle and <UNK> film festivals and <UNK> plotting while <UNK> suffers from an american accent old <UNK> shoes and <UNK> <UNK> nonetheless he has moments of stellar scenery chewing and the film offers sinister ambiguity from norman <UNK> the pretty polly walker and a surprise ending to frequent <UNK> while a beautiful look at the of both <UNK> and <UNK> due out in video release after a cable airing in march not to be missed by any <UNK> fan ignore the <UNK>
<START> while in one country spain luis <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> combined forces to create the <UNK> of short subject cinematic <UNK> un <UNK> <UNK> walt disney and his <UNK> <UNK> in america worked on <UNK> willie the most prominent of the early <UNK> sound cartoons it was revealed that this was not the first contrary to other reports it's also one of the more successfully simplistic and funny of the mickey mouse shorts still in a silent film way the only sounds are little <UNK> and <UNK> from the mickey and the animals it also goes by fairly quickly for its less than ten minute run but in these minutes one gets the immediate sense of how much fun disney has with his characters and how the <UNK> use of sound changes how his creation uses the animals as musical tools there's no story to speak of just random things that happens and occurs because of mickey <UNK> <UNK> willie on this boat on a river and like the better mickey mouse shorts his lack of speaking acts as an advantage it's a must see if you haven't seen it as a kid but if you have it might still be worth another look
<START> i just watched that movie and was pretty disappointed i didn't expect much to begin with as the premise of the movie doesn't suggest greatness anyway sadly it doesn't even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment the main problem is probably the acting while i've seen far worse actors in far worse movies the story would require some people to act out as violent <UNK> some others as people caught a in really <UNK> <UNK> and they fail to deliver that although i watched the german release i watched with the original audio so it's definitely not just bad voice overs or anything like that added to that the german dvd release seems to be cut the killings are all pretty much left out meaning that except for a few semi gory scenes closer to the end the german release doesn't deliver as a movie for gore <UNK> either can't comment on that for other releases of course the plot has some stupid moments thrown in here and there and the beginning is just hilarious ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist too bad the movie takes itself far too seriously if it was filmed as a horror comedy and changed a bit here and there <UNK> it might have worked better the ending is just a huge disappointment br br if you've got really nothing better to do and just can't stand the boredom anymore you might and it's really a weak might consider this movie if there's anything else available to watch or do pick that alternative
<START> <UNK> marks the only venture of both paul newman and director robert altman into the realm of science fiction it was said of newman that he could not do comedy but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with slap shot but the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again br br this is one of the biggest <UNK> films i've ever seen it's a futuristic ice age brought on by who knows what but presumably it's a nuclear winter even during the ice age of thousands of years ago the parts of the earth still <UNK> animal and human life but apparently not here <UNK> have survived and paul newman is a seal hunter on the outside br br but hunters do need a little r r and newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of russian <UNK> to win you have to kill five other participants in your game br br it's a sad turn to see what man has come down to which is one of the reasons i just could not get into this story the atmosphere is bleak the story is bleak the people are bleak it's all so bleak no wonder this thing came up short at the box office br br it's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of paul newman films including me br br this is man's future what a <UNK>
<START> up and coming was a very positive sitcom which brought a tool and or channel that opened the young minds of the black culture the focus and <UNK> was a message of <UNK> for our people and hope for change i advise this selection for every american household to experience the struggle and the reward the show was never given the chance to <UNK> into the idea of middle class blacks becoming business owners of their own the were so <UNK> with real life that <UNK> the lives of so many i sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored and put on dvd for americans to enjoy with their families br br thanks
<START> ignore the bad reviews on here this film is awesome just before dawn is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew decent script and a cool idea for a film it's a hell of a lot of fun br br i enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique wrong turn ripped this movie off something fierce there's plenty of blood and scares my girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't <UNK> it's got that creepiness to it br br i'd say that just before dawn is the best early 80's slasher out there i really enjoyed it br br 8 out of 10 kids
<START> some modern horror movies are very good strong plot scary moments good acting while others are just unfortunately belongs to the latter camp br br i will rate the movie based on 3 elements plot scary factor and acting br br 1 plot true to the name the movie the plot moves in circle and never really explains itself ok the town is captivated by the spiral curse but why and why do people act so <UNK> there is a fleeting attempt to explain about what is happening by the reporter br br 2 scary factor if this was meant to be a horror flick it has failed miserably i can't really remember one good scary scene with plenty of build up to it br br 3 acting very monotonous people walking around saying meaningless <UNK> i can't really feel much empathy for our tragic heroes br br all in all there are much better modern japanese horror movies out there with coherent plot and strong characterization don't bother wasting your time on this wannabe
<START> how truly sad that this <UNK> from the same mind as <UNK> <UNK> possibly one of the best films in this genre where do i even begin i think one of the must <UNK> aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be <UNK> humanity and yet we see no humanity in the film no more than 5 minutes of the film is spend <UNK> about the possible death of another human these are horrible one dimensional cardboard <UNK> of human beings sadly that's how they are played with what can only be described as dreadful acting is this truly how kelly sees humanity judging from the reaction of viewers this is a horrible <UNK> of humanity why don't the characters in the film ask the questions that all the viewers have this is not an <UNK> of humanity it's an <UNK> of the straw men that kelly sets up who bare almost no resemblance to real humans in this situation br br to those who say this was a wonderful thought provoking film to what are you comparing it <UNK> i even saw someone compare this to the works of kurosawa how truly <UNK> must you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion for the love of all that's good in film even <UNK> <UNK> is ten times the <UNK> of humanity that this is there we see people truly <UNK> about greed and the human condition yes even <UNK> <UNK> puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5 3 vs 6 0 for this mindless tripe br br rarely have i seen a more pretentious <UNK> and self <UNK> film fall so <UNK> on its face this has the depth of a high school film project and a poor one at that truly that's about the level of the discussion promoted by this film if you want to see good psychological film making do yourself a favor and check out <UNK> experiment if the box had lived up even to this one goal i would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious acting <UNK> plot holes and sheer nonsensical storyline sadly it can't even do that br br the true <UNK> of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deeply <UNK> <UNK> look into the human condition this is not <UNK> this is not even the cliff notes version of <UNK> this is a <UNK> conceived and hack written <UNK> grade term paper on <UNK> based on some internet message board <UNK> if <UNK> were alive he would sue kelly for <UNK>
<START> the storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park the filmmakers didn't even try to hide that it seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur dolls so instead the viewer sees some robot like toy <UNK> from a cheap which move in a very unnatural way it's funny though because it's so bad the acting is almost as unnatural as the <UNK> are no one seems really excited to be in this movie which i totally understand especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep the one positive comment note i'd like to make about <UNK> is that it doesn't take a full 90 minutes
<START> on the <UNK> of being <UNK> somehow i stayed just slightly interested but was it because i truly wanted to know what the secret was which i should say is pretty damned obvious or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit this movie is poor and what's more it's a disgrace to all the lonely alcoholic southern literature <UNK> out there travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry <UNK> in the bathroom after <UNK> blood sorry pal you were more believable is staying alive not everyone can pull a peter fonda in <UNK> gold if you want the against type brave anti hero oscar you have to um actually act not just <UNK> on screen stop this director before he she name is vague on gender directs again
<START> seriously reality charity tv these producers must think that the masses are full of non <UNK> br br these shows are called reality which means they are suppose to resemble something real with truth or facts br br i suppose the characters are really acting in all the pathetic <UNK> br br at one point i wonder if these type of shows <UNK> or increase the collective <UNK> br br we live in a world that already contains individuals that are not authentic br br is it necessary to promote an <UNK> way of being
<START> i am very into <UNK> hills and first watched death tunnel the movie couldn't have been much worse then i heard that the documentary was coming out and got excited thinking that since it was a documentary it would be more serious and not have the horrible special effects wrong the same guys did the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it raw the way a documentary should be <UNK> hills doesn't need help with goofy effects its fine just the way it is <UNK> are 20 00 per person and 100 00 for 8 hour overnight investigation per person minimal group of 10 for overnight investigation <UNK> must be set up ahead of time awesome place for the ghost hunter
<START> directed by luis <UNK> presents an extraordinary view of religion in mexico as written by the director and <UNK> <UNK> his notable <UNK> this was a film that put mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the grand <UNK> in cannes that year it's a disturbing film because mr <UNK> <UNK> deep into what's wrong with the church br br by all <UNK> is a saint this young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy <UNK> of a city he doesn't have enough for himself but he doesn't mind <UNK> with a <UNK> when a <UNK> appears by his window asking for help at the same time he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman the woman <UNK> his kindness by burning the room and the whole building is seen taking to the countryside begging for food and <UNK> two prostitutes from his old town follow him life parallels that of jesus in fact this <UNK> figure makes a case for <UNK> br br of course mr <UNK> had no religion in mind when he and mr <UNK> took it upon themselves to create this film it's ironic how spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing christian qualities when in reality this is an <UNK> satire on the catholic church and its <UNK> br br francisco the spanish actor makes a wonderful this was one of his best roles mr worked <UNK> in his native country but also in mexico and <UNK> rita as is also excellent lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of <UNK> br br a great film by one of the <UNK> master film makers luis <UNK>
<START> arthur miller has always been known as one of america's great <UNK> for works such as death of a salesman and the <UNK> focus is one of his lesser known plays brought to the silver screen however knowing what a great playwright arthur miller is i doubt that his original play was very much like the movie the movie comes across as empty and formulaic with william h macy as a non jew mistaken for a jew by anti <UNK> neighbors in wwii brooklyn don't get me wrong the acting is ok and i presume that the people behind this movie were probably trying to make a point about racism but the movie just doesn't work macy laura dern and david <UNK> just can't create an effective story with the material here
<START> there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this i remember feeling the same way after <UNK> dogma if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like <UNK> dr you are seen as not getting it of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway br br i have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream like quality it has in other words the plot isn't structured like other films with the case of <UNK> dr it seems more like an <UNK> <UNK> made by a third grade boy who until the last second to do his art project it doesn't make sense it isn't supposed to but i know it was to be a tv series at first it appears lynch had a stack of <UNK> film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff you will notice that toward the end the nudity sex and foul language increase all things he would not have filmed for television br br for a better film not told in a traditional linear fashion rent the thin red line from 1998 that was a great film this is not br br rating 2 out of ten
<START> aaron raises the same questions as shakespeare did or does how could they possibly know so much about the inner <UNK> of palace life here like in the west wing opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives a <UNK> tom hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without <UNK> the consequences and julia roberts in a blond southern <UNK> reminds us of the powers <UNK> in the <UNK> the subject is serious but the treatment is light intelligent but light philip seymour hoffman as the invisible middle man steals every scene he is in just like charles <UNK> did in every movie he was in the dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy the seemingly casual pace filled with <UNK> of wit and <UNK> <UNK> another <UNK> of honor in the mike collection
<START> dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard she traps him into bringing her back with him br br <UNK> <UNK> in the title role is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out br br margaret <UNK> is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no <UNK> here in fact miss <UNK> was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts br br nice to see david <UNK> in the film he would get together with <UNK> in the far superior mary <UNK> 16 years later br br miranda causes <UNK> in that two guys a <UNK> fiancée and <UNK> <UNK> fall for her br br ask any mermaid you happen to see what's the best <UNK> chicken of the sea as for this film forget it
<START> the <UNK> new groove was a great twist for disney it wasn't a musical it had clean fresh jokes and no political twists it was just a darn funny movie br br new groove on the other hand is tired and weak my 3 year old still loves <UNK> new groove but fell asleep during there really isn't any really conflict that in the first movie lead to all of the wacky adventures because of the lack of conflict it almost seems like the animators threw out the writers and just made the storyline up as they went along br br i kept waiting for something to happen that would make the movie fun and still am
<START> i saw this television version of a christie mystery story when it was shown back on channel 5 in new york city in 1980 at the time i was surprised it was not shown on channel 13 the public television station that showed most of the masterpiece theater programs but aside from some dorothy <UNK> lord peter <UNK> stores and the the bbc productions rarely dealt with british detective stories another series the rivals of sherlock holmes had dealt with stories set in the victorian and <UNK> period so a period charm was involved in getting those stories onto channel 13 br br the plot of why didn't they ask evans dealt with a young couple stumbling upon a dying man who's only last words are the question of the title of the story the novel was originally called why didn't they ask evans but subsequently was <UNK> the <UNK> clue the young couple start investigating the murder and trace the crime to a set of people who surround a questionable doctor eric porter despite the <UNK> of the father of the hero john gielgud the hero james <UNK> and the heroine <UNK> <UNK> pursue their investigation even as it gets <UNK> and more dangerous the death of another suspect by suicide <UNK> the apparent dangers as the killer starts looking into <UNK> the two amateur detectives br br it's not a bad film although i agree it was a bit too long for a single <UNK> entertainment if it had been done like later miss <UNK> episodes with joan or the <UNK> <UNK> episodes in two parts it would have been better but it has it's strengths one is the proper use of porter as chief suspect and a clever scene later in the film where he appears to be <UNK> on the young couple who are investigating the mystery if you stick to the film you will be in for a fair surprise later on br br but it has one failing when dealing with a christie novel the figures in the story have to be in a rigid schedule of movements so that the reader might be able to figure out what the secret of the plot is i will only add that if you hear the dialog at one point and how a little boy was almost killed but wasn't then you will find all the parts of the story coming together and what the <UNK> motivations were br br except for that and the lengthy time the <UNK> takes to tell it's story it is quite a good film and worthy as one of the best programs based on a christie story in the period when their was a sudden renaissance in films based on her novels
<START> i was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie i was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money i believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is little things like the lights create a true uneasy feeling the shadows and <UNK> cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films anything could happen in the film the acting is by no means perfect nor were they bad the main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her in the end i was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects br br it is definitely a film i would recommend
<START> christopher <UNK> first film is a <UNK> <UNK> black and white film about a unemployed writer who begins following strangers which in turn leads to robbery and also violence it is very good br br like in his later film he doesn't present the story in a linear way instead it jumps around somewhat so you end up really sucked in trying to piece it all together and early apparently random shots take on significance as the film progresses this style also means the twists are much more effective br br definitely worth seeing if you get the chance especially if you like his later work and or film noir
<START> through its 2 hour running length crash <UNK> the emotional anguish of its 10 odd ensemble of characters when faced with the sometimes blatant and sometimes <UNK> forms of racism underlying in american society that and the emotional anguish of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these days br br the era we live in has become so complicated not only do we reject <UNK> even the not very enthusiastic flag waving of post <UNK> ideas is always being shot down by what post post <UNK> that aims to destroy all these ideas all in no part thanks to the great ideas of those great but i <UNK> this has nothing much to do with the what the movie is about but rather what the movie is br br sure it seems hard to earn a living in a hollywood that has to <UNK> to a market that is so post post post everything that cynicism has become more than just a <UNK> in life it has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think of whether we like it or not and so a new studio product is born indie films which once were energetic and idealistic in its <UNK> <UNK> now seem to be as equally <UNK> as hollywood films to sell to indie film <UNK> an indie film must sell at sundance before becoming and so nothing is simple anymore even what <UNK> a good film becomes so murky whereas in the past filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story and in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of films are <UNK> filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good first and foremost films have to make people think have to be meaningful has to be provocative raise questions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what it all <UNK> down to is a <UNK> of the hollywood movie system but this <UNK> seems strangely similar to the formulaic similarity of hollywood films the countless ways of <UNK> to essentially be the same product br br and i haven't even begun on the film yet maybe i've become too <UNK> on films i see these days maybe it's because of my primary need to be entertained rather than say be when seeing a movie but hell this movie is one big load of crap and i'm <UNK> by this movie not just because it follows the how to make a good movie good 101 to the t characters <UNK> <UNK> lines and are <UNK> witty like they're gifted with the speech of god it raises issues about racism and life confronting racism in america it has moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people not to mention the fact that once you hear the <UNK> new age soundtrack of women singing in high <UNK> in foreign languages you know you're in for all of the above traits br br and something about the aforementioned point about it raising questions about immediately compelling issues like racism <UNK> me off big time like all post post post post post everything movies it doesn't <UNK> with just having a message about this issue because oh our audiences are much to intelligent for that these days in this post post post post world our audiences want us to make them think doesn't want us to put things so <UNK> and then they will go into <UNK> crap and say that's because life itself isn't simplistic ha ha ha what other common <UNK> do we here then the audience need to think about issues rather than have them fed to them okay okay and okay so the film makes it a point to pound the audiences with these non messages and since they're not exactly a message it's so decidedly subtle and subtle means good right so we're being hit again and again with this well written subtlety with the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and as if the irony is not <UNK> enough we have character the only character who seems to not take all these racism discussion <UNK> seriously being into one of those <UNK> meaningful characters where he learns something in the end giving meaningful looks and pauses where audiences are supposed to something about themselves <UNK> um yeah how i wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this man br br to cut the long <UNK> short i guess i wouldn't have taken issue with the film if it wasn't so <UNK> in its self importance the angst that forms the entire movie felt more like white boy whining than actual spike lee ish anger it's so tim robbins and sean penn the type that wants to wave <UNK> about when the only thing they don't realize is the flag they're waving is their hole ridden underwear plus it's become so trendy in the post post post post world to be completely subtle about it nothing is simple any longer in its best efforts to actually be good provocative and ultimately human it's become neither imho just another indie crap from an indie director that wants to make a name out of himself as a credible indie filmmaker now at least hollywood is more simple and sincere in its
<START> i can't believe i sat through this garbage palm trees in d c already mentioned a <UNK> as dead body bit so obviously artificial that i thought it was supposed to be a <UNK> until it left a stilted dialogue ridiculous plot i think it's a shame that jill <UNK> final film before her death was this stinker don't waste your time i wish i hadn't the only saving grace is that it was on cable so i didn't waste my money on top of everything
<START> when you're watching distant you know you're not watching a french movie there's little sex and it's mostly <UNK> and people don't talk that much here there are a few lines scattered here and there and a couple of important conversations just to let you make sense of what's going on it doesn't look american either there aren't any car chases or shoot outs or violence unless you consider the killing of a mouse an act of blood or the daily tension of getting by a subdued catastrophe at times the relatively long held medium distance shots may remind you of asian cinema but just reminds you the director doesn't push things to the radical <UNK> of some <UNK> filmmakers but then again this is not a <UNK> movie it's a turkish movie i don't know what that means i don't even know if that's supposed to mean something br br the movie doesn't have a plot proper and yet those few lines those somewhat long held shots and that often <UNK> tension gradually build a sense of something happening a sense of <UNK> for lack of a better word that grows on you by the end of the movie you may get the feeling you're going to miss those two cousins who have many things in common but are worlds apart
<START> during the 13 years of <UNK> i had from <UNK> through high school there was only one day that my class took a field trip when i went to school you went to school from 8 30 until 3 30 and <UNK> <UNK> were not taken but for some reason i could not recall at this advanced age we went to see a movie national <UNK> i do not recall the movie so on the eve of my year i decided to <UNK> it br br it is a movie about a time that no longer exists a time when people trusted others and didn't lock their houses a time when people were given the benefit of the doubt it was a time when family was the most important thing this film shows all of that and more it shows love and trust and caring and the goodness of people br br it would not be a bad thing for every family to view this film once in a while and discuss its message br br it was a treat to see the young elizabeth taylor mickey rooney at his best the academy award winning performance of anne <UNK> angela lansbury before murder she wrote and donald crisp who performed for almost sixty years br br what a movie
<START> billy hughes is a mute young lady working for make up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in <UNK> by an american director one night billy gets locked in the movie studio later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out that's when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered while being filmed after escaping the <UNK> of the murderers billy informs the authorities only to be red faced when the men show it was an act billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importance br br i don't know how this heart <UNK> sleeper passed me by but i thought it was a much older flick there's one thing though it's got to be one of the most <UNK> and intense thrillers i've seen in quite a while it's just a great suspense <UNK> and mostly everything <UNK> into place the first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an <UNK> foreboding environment of alienation <UNK> this is a <UNK> wicked black streak faults do pop up in the story as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour or better <UNK> comic relief between fay <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> characters is a hit and miss affair by being too <UNK> in the long run it probably could have done without despite some cringe moments this aspect didn't <UNK> my enjoyment of it for me the soft ending they decided to go with just didn't feel right br br the interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods so multi <UNK> was the context and its thrills there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the <UNK> <UNK> and unbearable tension are <UNK> into a range of sudden plot turns and twists really they made superb use of the novel idea of this <UNK> and to <UNK> the situation by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke english and so we are caught up in the confusion too the delicate <UNK> gives a harrowing portrayal of the american mute girl billy the way she able to display the <UNK> emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability director anthony <UNK> shoots the flick in a rather stylish well timed and <UNK> manner without <UNK> that <UNK> look that <UNK> from its rigid surroundings and a <UNK> <UNK> music score <UNK> <UNK> at you the only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by alec guinness the performances by the cast were all fine especially the nail biting turns by <UNK> and <UNK> as the russian murderers br br this riveting feature that's mostly made up of <UNK> is way better than your average dark thriller highly recommended
<START> wow just caught this movie from blockbuster and i love finding gems like this while it was definitely shot on a budget and misses a little bit in clumsy editing i e accident hospital scenes second to last end scenes for a first directorial effort i give this 10 stars i absolutely loved the thought provoking concepts brought forth and if you're a free <UNK> and open to ideas outside the box i highly highly recommend this movie i think the director and writer jay <UNK> should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry based on his credits he may be another quentin tarantino
<START> i'm a fan of good plausible action movies and i'm a huge fan of the elite military <UNK> such as the navy <UNK> finally i'm a huge fan of michael <UNK> sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time i gave it another chance more recently when i bought the dvd here's the problems with this movie in a quick list 1 it's a poor mans top gun for example including a virtual music video of the seal team playing golf with a soundtrack of the boys are back in town which concludes with charlie sheen doing an inane chase to get his car back br br 2 this is quite simply a charlie sheen movie when sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like hot shots reports i've heard indicate that sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and direction the rest of the actors in the movie got br br 3 <UNK> is the head of the seal team yet sheen seldom <UNK> him any seal showing the lack of discipline that <UNK> character does or who <UNK> the team as he does wouldn't even have made it through <UNK> training let alone gotten on a team br br 4 <UNK> are cross trained on weapons yet in one part of the movie a seal has to figure out how to use a u s <UNK> missile br br there are a few good scenes in the movie the assault entry at the beginning bill paxton as god and some of the footage in what was supposed to be <UNK> at the time overall though this movie is a loser
<START> i watched as a second choice after <UNK> was sold out i have never seen so many people walk out of a movie sean penn kevin spacey and <UNK> <UNK> can do nothing to save this coke <UNK> endlessly <UNK> bad mamet wannabe
<START> it was on a day in when scottish <UNK> william k l <UNK> surprised his boss thomas edison with his remarkable work in the development of motion pictures after many experiments <UNK> was now able to capture scenes of real life with his camera and <UNK> them through his invention the <UNK> as if a <UNK> of time were <UNK> in celluloid soon <UNK> would become an enormous success as a new way of entertainment with many people eager to pay the <UNK> that was charged to be able to watch people dancing or performing stunts through the of the <UNK> however the invention wasn't complete in order for it to capture on film the real life as we know it sound was needed on the movies so <UNK> kept <UNK> and this short experiment first film was the result br br in this experiment <UNK> simply as <UNK> experimental sound film director william k l <UNK> stands in front of a recording <UNK> for a wax <UNK> earliest method of recording sound with his <UNK> on hands playing a song named song of the cabin boy the idea was to record the song into the <UNK> at the same time that the camera was recording his movements in order to show that this was a motion picture two of <UNK> black maria laboratory decided to do a little dance in front of the camera unlike what author <UNK> russo claimed in his book the celluloid closet this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality as it obviously is a reference to the environment of loneliness of the lab akin to the lonely sailors to whom the song of the cabin boy was dedicated to the title russo suggests the gay brothers is actually <UNK> as gay had no homosexual <UNK> in the late <UNK> br br sadly <UNK> was unable to achieve the desired effect and the never could really produce the <UNK> audio with images while he had the <UNK> with the sound and the celluloid with the images the <UNK> of the two elements was not exactly effective and the sudden appearance of <UNK> and louis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> team to focus on <UNK> systems and eventually <UNK> left the company fortunately in 1998 <UNK> with the movie's sound was <UNK> and film editor walter made a <UNK> of the experiment as it was intended finally <UNK> experimental sound film could be heard with <UNK> sound just as its creative <UNK> had intended while it was not a successful attempt this outstanding film is a testament of the enormous genius of the father of <UNK> 8 10
<START> scarecrow gone wild he's the death of the party need i say more scarecrow gone wild got four out of ten stars from me for one simple reason aside from the terrible acting plot holes cheap special effects and anti climactic <UNK> it was cinematic gold i think that this movie could have actually been really good had the scarecrow turned out to be the baseball coach as portrayed by the ever so brilliant ken <UNK> but then again they would have had to cut those awesome return of the jedi electricity special effects br br while watching this movie my friends and i were convinced that it was in fact written by one of our friends a stereotypical teen aged boy this movie has topless women miserably fake gore and dialog that could not have talked its way out of a paper bag or in this case a <UNK> br br if i could ask the filmmaker one thing it would be this how much did you have to pay the teenager that wrote this for you
<START> very poor script and acting i was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new all is in the cliché of the mentor and the talented immature <UNK> the characters even interesting nor sympathetic artistically it is as empty and insignificant the colours are very <UNK> and light only the poster may be appealing al pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success too bad because the sport <UNK> can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate but i can't have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending everything was so predictable that it was a <UNK> of time
<START> this year's <UNK> was to me a big disappointment i've watched the <UNK> song contest every year since 1986 well at least that's the earliest one i can remember and i was only 2 at the time as any other year this one contained both good bad and horrible songs nothing new there however this year's show was the worst one i can remember only very few good probably more like it songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songs br br winner song every way that i can sounded to me like a rip off of turkish singer hit just sounding a lot worse it didn't deserve to win from my point of view song coming in second was a no language song wonder what's next animals singing nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling to which the lyrics seemed appropriate one of the better songs but that's not saying much br br after one of the closest races in <UNK> history russian duo t a t u ended in third place just three points behind turkey and behind <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> don't trust don't be afraid to me t a t u was one of the very few highlights of the show surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants they let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus they let the song speak very well indeed br br the biggest surprise when looking at the was <UNK> the here in <UNK> had the biggest odds on that song a song that indeed was beyond horrible but ended up in <UNK> place could it be that bum of his being <UNK> to the rhythm of the song that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most not because it looked good but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun br br sweden did what they do the best <UNK> in 1999 they won with take me to your heaven by sounding like <UNK> in 2001 they made the top 10 with listen to your <UNK> again sounding like <UNK> and once again this year they did it <UNK> style again ending in the top 10 br br england was finally <UNK> for making those absolutely horrible non catching songs that they've been the past years br br ireland ripped off the winner from 2000 fly on the wings of love and i could go on and on about how bad the songs were br br i feel a bit sorry for the <UNK> who this year finally got the chance to see the <UNK> song contest they deserved better than this br br i wasn't surprised by the show though the <UNK> from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years 2001 was quite good but not as good 2002 was okay but certainly no more this year was quite simply disappointing br br let's hope it'll get better next year if not for us then at least for the <UNK> br br 4 10 one for t a t u one for the close race one for the butt shaking and one for all the rest
<START> i saw this movie in blockbuster and thought it might be a good sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do so i bought it used 3 dvds for 25 although it was cheap my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot br br the film started out nicely kinda dark and mysterious i was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid i thought the <UNK> would be really cool the first fight scene was pretty cool i was excited for the rest of the movie then the movie took a serious nose dive br br i understand that this was a big hit in the east i guess because of the twins i don't see it though this movie aside from the first 10 minutes was absolutely horrible so many movies in this genre have the potential to be great and blow it terribly this is just another <UNK> br br chan's role in this film doesn't make any sense at all complete silliness he probably made a few bucks off it though br br the only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use nice idea br br i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone
<START> this movie is great best acting i have ever seen in my life e is the best <UNK> actor and of course <UNK> <UNK> and great music and sound cold hard reality about a struggle of a man that has a lot of problems and the people in his life black humor mixed with great acting and this european art movies style it works it comes together in a the best <UNK> movie ever made i say to you see this film you will not regret it i gave it 9 stars if you see one <UNK> film in your life see this one
<START> one hundred and <UNK> five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster not even michael bay had a budget that big for transformers so exactly how universal pictures spent that much cash making <UNK> almighty is a mystery they certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why steve <UNK> felt the need to <UNK> it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise br br a sequel to the jim carrey comedy bruce almighty this film sees former supporting character <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moving up the ladder into the main player <UNK> the story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to washington with his wife and three generic sons slightly weird primary school <UNK> spirited middle <UNK> and <UNK> teenager <UNK> <UNK> to change the world through politics however gets a <UNK> in the works when god morgan freeman appears and asks him to build an <UNK> br br in other words it's an <UNK> of the old <UNK> story with <UNK> fighting off cynicism and <UNK> to build the immense boat unfortunately while the premise is reasonably promising it sadly does not provide many laughs there's a bit of fun to be had in the early going where <UNK> straight laced <UNK> tries to <UNK> the demands of public service with the <UNK> packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that <UNK> all attempts to <UNK> it but as soon as he accepts his divine mission the film takes a <UNK> br br from this point on it turns into a message movie <UNK> begins preaching with <UNK> <UNK> and morgan freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom while gently <UNK> his chosen in the right direction without <UNK> resistance though the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animal <UNK> jokes and john michael role as <UNK> <UNK> right hand man <UNK> may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in arrested development but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking <UNK> especially seeing as <UNK> has all but placed his <UNK> <UNK> skills on the back <UNK> br br in some respects it's slightly similar to the passion of the christ but unlike mel <UNK> movie which encouraged everyone to believe in god through blood letting and guilt <UNK> <UNK> almighty tries a more gentle approach the movie simply tells us that we should have faith in god because he has faith in us unfortunately this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the passion is <UNK> is on <UNK> the jokes don't exist and <UNK> sykes makes a <UNK> to become the most annoying person on the planet it might be sweet but somebody just tossed <UNK> 000 000 overboard
<START> just see it it's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time see it more than once everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling sensation or tone the clarity of certain visuals and the of certain sounds are deliberately <UNK> with <UNK> images or pops <UNK> <UNK> and barely <UNK> sounds the structure is non linear and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as time runs both and expectations regarding plot and character are broken <UNK> a non traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity this is a part of a review usa the movie is emotionally intense intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing in surprising and unconventional ways <UNK> dennis <UNK>
<START> oh my god after having such a promising start <UNK> 2 <UNK> the <UNK> rule of what goes around comes around clearly very few things were thought out when this movie was made and what was up with scott wearing an <UNK> this should have been the last expedition into the <UNK> saga but more garbage was on its way this was the big reason why i didn't watch <UNK> 3 and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space <UNK> friday the 13th <UNK> in space <UNK> etc
<START> i disagree in calling this a <UNK> movie just because <UNK> also makes an appearance i can't imagine this as even approaching <UNK> classic that would be like calling <UNK> a <UNK> film the movie definitely <UNK> along with a murky plot at times i wondered if the script had either been dropped and <UNK> or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it watching this movie reminded me of watching children play acting and making the story up as they go along br br the characters are wooden the dialog is <UNK> and the whole story seems to be completely <UNK> who got killed when what and this is how you act when your friend <UNK> complete lack of emotion and utter <UNK> from reality br br as for the <UNK> guitar soundtrack that <UNK> each scene enough it was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track <UNK> endlessly in the background neither moving forward or back br br i kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order the acting and dialog would improve or something somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie after <UNK> minutes it never happened
<START> i have rarely laughed so hard at a movie notice that i laughed at iron eagle not with it because this is probably the stupidest film i have ever seen with the obvious exception of sci fi monstrosity you should also remember that this film is not a comedy br br even <UNK> the preposterous plot the idea that a 16 year old could walk into a us air force base steal an f 16 fly to the middle east and kill about a thousand people without anyone <UNK> is beyond belief the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense for example at various points doug masters uses a machine gun on his plane to shoot a steel a control tower and a <UNK> all of these things explode in a massive <UNK> why the enemy aircraft also explode in a strange way reminiscent of a paper <UNK> being blown up with a <UNK> br br on the plus side i did actually enjoy this film admittedly not in the way the makers probably wanted it to be enjoyed but all the same i laughed at it and later bought the dvd it's also improved by the awesome presence of david <UNK> as the evil terrorist leader maybe you'll recall him as <UNK> <UNK> detective <UNK> overall then the film is a laugh and a light hearted alternative to more serious fighter plane movies like top gun even if it is just as subtly <UNK> erotic check out the man hug between doug and <UNK> <UNK> going on between 'em
<START> i was looking forward to this and to be honest there were some bright spots but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world the many dogs were a lot of fun but i got bored of the wine <UNK> whining on about their achievements br br i felt it would have worked better as an hour long tv documentary <UNK> on one of the many different issues it explored the most interesting being the french town near fighting off a an american wine <UNK> campaign to get rid of the historic <UNK> a <UNK> mayor agreed to a deal a nicely timed election arrived and a communist mayor was elected who turned it down much to the <UNK> of the american wine <UNK> br br hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original
<START> married to the mob was one of the first vhs tapes that i had along with coming to america and grease i still have fond memories of this film after all these years hell i still have the vhs of this film in good condition br br the story undercover cop mike downey matthew <UNK> is sent to spy on angela de <UNK> michelle pfeiffer the wife of the <UNK> mafia member frank <UNK> de <UNK> alec baldwin he later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent in all this angela not only has to deal with the <UNK> advances of mob boss tony the tiger russo dean <UNK> she also has to deal with his jealous wife connie russo <UNK> <UNK> br br married to the mob is funny and still keeps your interest when its not trying to be funny i like the little <UNK> it takes at mafia life the jealous mafia wife the mob boss that doesn't realize that he is not a chick <UNK> etc and you like the characters of angela de <UNK> and mike downey it was the last of the funny phase of <UNK> <UNK> before he got serious and gave you gems like philadelphia and silence of the <UNK> best thriller of all time if you're in the mood for comedy married to the mob is a keeper its better than the rubbish that passes for comedy nowadays epic movie date movie meet the <UNK> disaster movie etc
<START> i thought this movie was excellent jon foster is one of my top favorite actors he was perfect as micheal i found everything about it to be great acting costumes production directing photography script and music etc br br spoilers coming up you have been warned br br martha who they had tell the story in the movie was <UNK> to death by her violent troubled neighbor micheal micheal did this out of jealousy of his brother tommy when martha rejected him and took tommy instead thankfully though they caught him years later and he was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison although i think he should have been sentenced to natural life without the possibility of <UNK> br br kudos to the cast crew and filmmakers two thumbs way up
<START> this short a <UNK> cartoon featuring <UNK> le <UNK> concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a <UNK> trouble is he <UNK> the most <UNK> attention of an honest and for truly <UNK> our hero <UNK> entering stage left being decidedly more <UNK> shall we say than m cat would like every great plan has its <UNK> but this one's a <UNK> i wonder if jack warner got a call from the <UNK> office over the fact that <UNK> and the object of his <UNK> were both male after all betty <UNK> was in part responsible for the production code coming into <UNK> subsequent <UNK> were clearly and most definitely female very good cartoon but <UNK> is a character who works better as the <UNK> point rather than supporting well worth watching recommended
<START> i did not like this movie i rented it hoping it would be something like the <UNK> kingdom i was disappointed when i discovered it wasn't i also found it just plain the acting was bad the characters where unbelievable and the time jumps were crazy i only <UNK> this film if your in the mood to see a crazy dude running around but i'm sure there are better films with the same thing i can't believe i wasted my time on this one
<START> i had to call my mother a <UNK> to ask her about this was it really that bad in the 40s in new york surprise she couldn't remember so i told her to see the movie arthur miller in not a screen play but a novel for a change was 30 when he wrote this in 1945 it is a painful depiction of anti <UNK> yet oddly enough there is a tender story of human relationships the jew with newman the non jew primarily underlying the cruel story the acting is competent and the cinematography is very good br br the only reason i can think of for this not making it big in the theatre is that it's controversial br br i actually give it ten of ten maybe a bit high but it's so worth seeing
<START> when you read the comment on this film that it's smart and funny political comedy based on true events the only true word here is that it's a comedy if you're told it's <UNK> movie about russian politics it's not there's probably only 2 in the movie from what really happened in russia during that election campaign in reality of the 1996 it was thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a real funky election campaign well there were <UNK> <UNK> from the us working in the staff but their role was just minimal the whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the movie it would be much funnier showing all the <UNK> people riding across the country with paper boxes full of cash and the celebrities giving the shows to support all over the place at least that would be true i give it three only because of the respect to jeff goldblum <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and about the machine guns on the streets of <UNK> i was living in the place that had the highest amount of hard crime in russia in the middle of 90 s and never seen a man with the gun on the street
<START> working the night shift in a seedy police station stumbling through life in an alcoholic <UNK> detective mickey hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with but when a <UNK> on the head <UNK> terrifying psychic visions things get truly weird soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and <UNK> the mystery of his beautiful first victim the <UNK> alice br br the role of an <UNK> burn out seems <UNK> made for <UNK> sutherland and he makes the most of it the <UNK> typical serial killer stuff but it has enough quirks twists and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget one wonders what this film could have been if <UNK> been money for a few more <UNK> and a few more takes br br all in all <UNK> is a pleasant <UNK> for anyone but for fans of lewis <UNK> <UNK> books it's a real treat from the <UNK> <UNK> reality in which things are rarely what they've seem to more obvious references a killer called 'the who leaves playing cards on his <UNK> bodies there's an <UNK> reference at every turn below is a list of the ones i <UNK> since finding them yourself is half the fun i've marked them as spoilers br br spoilers br br cast of characters br br mickey in a sense he's alice himself wandering through strange landscapes <UNK> odd characters but harvey <UNK> his true nature <UNK> him as the hapless bumbling white knight br br john <UNK> boss is he really you be the judge br br <UNK> an african american <UNK> obviously the black queen br br margaret <UNK> mickey calls her the red queen but her brutal nature suggests more specifically the queen of hearts br br <UNK> wood suspected of being the <UNK> killer his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a or a perhaps br br harvey his role as <UNK> guide to <UNK> and his name <UNK> of another famous cinematic rabbit makes me think he must be the white rabbit br br dr vera <UNK> her last name and relationship with mickey suggest the white queen br br other connections br br adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a rabbit hole br br mickey <UNK> tells his cat to stop <UNK> at him <UNK> cat br br the killer is revealed the looking <UNK> br br the climatic showdown ends in a <UNK> of playing cards just as <UNK> adventure did in the book br br the <UNK> in the garden look like giant chess pieces
<START> hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've <UNK> of <UNK> a blue van with flames and an observation bubble br br the cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen <UNK> harold and andy <UNK> make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless <UNK> of don't forget the airport antics of <UNK> <UNK> dressed up as <UNK> dancing <UNK> and playing the <UNK> <UNK> the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless br br a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play
<START> it is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed the dialogue was so bad it was sickening the train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students lou diamond phillips must have hidden under his seat when this this movie was shown at a private screening he most likely left by the back door the only emotion it <UNK> in me was pity for the cast they had to bite the bullet to get through this one i couldn't stand to watch all of it it was so predictable that it was funny who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy
<START> when i started watching this i instantly noticed that i couldn't understand what anyone was saying i turned up the volume with background noises now <UNK> out i could hear the voices just what are the actors saying is the movie not dubbed are they speaking spanish after some confusion i realize that it was english at least i think so the amazing jess franco has placed the <UNK> too far away from the actors as a result we cannot completely hear what they are saying he's done this before but maybe this is mr <UNK> intention by not knowing what people are saying we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on and are left with more visual clues maybe it's just me but i would have liked to know what was going on how about a few hints the basic premise i refuse to call it a plot concerns a young american exotic dancer named paula played by <UNK> newman who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy rich people it is somewhere off the coast of spain for this visit a large cash <UNK> is promised to paula which the boyfriend gets he then escapes from the island only to return later why pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens <UNK> us <UNK> though his hand tried to cover it up you can see the <UNK> real name <UNK> newman <UNK> below the photo on the bottom of the <UNK> anyway back to the story there are some other sleazy rich beautiful characters visiting the island all with ambiguous motives we witness sadistic games are they real or fake and unappealing <UNK> scenes but the food must be good as a phony french chef prepared it there is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks is she really mute and do we care of course all the women are mostly naked throughout this film oh well we can at least be thankful that the 50 and overweight men remain <UNK> in addition to the abysmal sound quality what i have always <UNK> at about jess franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely turned off this film is no exception  i needed fresh air after watching it br br in conclusion i am happy to report that regardless of what mr franco can dream up i am still attracted to women
<START> our gang got one chance at a feature film in its 22 year history and this was the best that could be done it's boring forced and pointless and i must <UNK> disagree with the other poster on this film the 1994 little <UNK> remake was better than this almost anything is the kids are <UNK> to the civil war proceedings it doesn't feel like an our gang film at all but like a <UNK> second rate shirley temple clone
<START> b b <UNK> proves to be a great actor in this little seen movie <UNK> really gets into his characters literally i caught this on cable one night and enjoyed it too bad it was released <UNK> in theaters the same year as fear and loathing and half baked
<START> writer director <UNK> <UNK> shows a definite lack of talent here with this un <UNK> supposed comedy the script is completely hopeless let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and badly worked the comedy just does not work when <UNK> isn't using poor taste sex jokes he is <UNK> used gags and re doing them very poorly you would think the <UNK> of <UNK> and brother charlie sheen would be cool but it isn't br br the entire cast is uninspired and unfunny never managing to raise a laugh and barely <UNK> a smile from their audience do yourself a favour and leave this one on the video shelf br br <UNK> june 25 1992 video
<START> this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen no story no point it wasn't even funny at all not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked so much felix bean the main character sucked <UNK> sucked this movie was made in 1996 and it really was set in the 80s what else i'm never letting my friend pick movies ever again hmm the movie cover said it was from the producers from super troopers who kidnapped them and stole their identities wow what a waste of time the only minute thing that was funny was freaky ricky he was funny especially when he and emily ended up together that was funny all and all it sucked waste of time and sleep wow never thought a movie like this could be made so dumb for watching for watching it to the end
<START> we bought the dvd of walking with dinosaurs and have been nearly <UNK> over the things that are done so very well on it br br many dvds today offer the bare minimum the feature itself and maybe one other language which doesn't help the viewer at all but makes it easier for the company to see the dvd in multiple <UNK> br br not so in the case of there are so many wonderful extras and well thought out vignettes that watching even the <UNK> menu is interesting the <UNK> to each chapter in the making of dvd are laugh out loud funny the quality of the sound and video is terrific and of course the story and content what more could a dinosaur lover ask for br br i did watch most of the version broadcast on narrated by <UNK> brooks then watched about half of the dvd narrated by kenneth <UNK> as near as i can tell the broadcast version slipped in a number of mostly american <UNK> terms in the narration i e in a section about t rex <UNK> says the female is <UNK> of the <UNK> attention and brooks says the honeymoon is over and cut out some of the closer in puppet work i prefer the version simply because it is more complete br br overall a great value and wonderful production many kudos to the bbc and the crew that made this gem
<START> this movie is <UNK> a horror movie and if you do not get scared than you must not be watching this movie it works on the old techniques but throws something new into the mix this movie grips and runs and hides within your mind the movie has a point to it unlike other horror movies watch it for a thrill and shock to your system
<START> i've always enjoyed animated <UNK> for some reason duck tales <UNK> duck <UNK> duck donald duck though none of them are as deranged as originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997 lasted for a total 70 episodes but could easily have gone on forever without becoming stale br br the titular character is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and pretty much the worst living person in the world he's a private detective a widower a <UNK> tom an alcoholic a sex maniac a murderer a fill in the blank you name it has done it but who can blame him for being such a <UNK> when the world he we live in is so insane outrageous and just plain nonsensical eric voiced by the <UNK> jason alexander could carry the whole show by himself but when he's surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters you just know that trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity my favorite has to be or just pig incredibly deadpan sidekick who is seemingly talented and highly skilled at everything and is <UNK> oblivious to his <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and incompetence br br the typical plot will involve some bizarre case he'll inevitably <UNK> through or will <UNK> around his highly dysfunctional household though every now and again arch enemy king chicken tim <UNK> a sort of professor <UNK> in <UNK> form <UNK> some diabolical scheme in revenge for being <UNK> in high school br br since i was a teenager this has been my absolute favorite animated show better than the simpsons family guy and even king of the hill nothing will ever <UNK> it there never was or will be anything quite like ever again the level of satire <UNK> humor and writing is so sharp it's deadly and the animation is done in that unique <UNK> <UNK> style anyone who has seen <UNK> will understand it's a wonderful highly imaginative and wild world and all with a <UNK> 1940s feel br br you can never have too much of this particular bird
<START> i just re watched a few episodes of this series on very poor vhs tapes that i recorded the series on i'm glad i did though br br is based on the children's books by beverly <UNK> and follows the adventures of the title eight year old sarah she has fun with friends and family and gets into trouble much like many eight year olds all ten episodes are pretty good mystery meal kind of me out as a <UNK> but it's funny seeing the parents trying to get their kids to eat <UNK> tongue and any episode that mentions godzilla versus the <UNK> monster twice can't be all bad i like bad day even more although it's <UNK> to see going through a rough day she does imagine herself getting revenge on her friend <UNK> uncle a pre factor <UNK> hope who always <UNK> her the perfect day is also good br br <UNK> plays sister i swear i've seen her on something else but imdb doesn't list anything besides this show unfortunately this series is not on dvd why is every crappy show made these days on dvd except something i'd actually like to buy an injustice if there ever was one
<START> returning from 20 years in china a young <UNK> refuses to become the <UNK> <UNK> for a gang of hometown <UNK> br br this movie was a bit of a departure from harold <UNK> previous movies comedy derived more from dialogue often rather serious <UNK> here rather than the elaborate sight gags which powered <UNK> classics of the past there are some splendid moments however which are pure visual fun as when harold attempts to follow a <UNK> down a crowded street or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes there is also the climactic scene set in a <UNK> basement in which harold <UNK> jumps <UNK> into the darkest comedy but most of the humor <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> to be the <UNK> of the criminals who've run his hometown for years br br and it's quite a collection of crooked politicians thugs harold finds himself up against played by a <UNK> of fine character actors george <UNK> <UNK> grant mitchell <UNK> <UNK> alan warren <UNK> <UNK> fuzzy knight <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is on hand as the <UNK> stand girl who catches <UNK> eye and keeps him intrigued by her no nonsense <UNK> on life br br movie <UNK> will recognize samuel s <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> father charles <UNK> as an elderly <UNK> and herman bing as a german gangster all uncredited also showing up for only a few seconds as an attempted <UNK> is <UNK> young a familiar face from <UNK> silent films here making his final appearance in a lloyd picture br br fox gave the film fine production values especially in the opening scenes set in china
<START> i learned a thing you have to take this film like a funny period comedy if you don't want to be disappointed the film's enjoyable because it's a delicious comedy i think the over hype damaged it the too much <UNK> monica <UNK> appears in few scenes and isn't so good as they wanted to let you believe she sounds unnatural false the best actress in this film is sabrina who speaks with a perfect <UNK> accent and shines together with <UNK> <UNK> is very very good the most promising young italian actor according to me daniel <UNK> looks like <UNK> but i preferred other actors so the most hyped performances were also the worst br br costumes and production design are okay sure american period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets but the italian ability <UNK> the lack of money a nice period comedy in short with a first rate casting except for <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this movie sucks so bad its funny to see what a poor story this has where two <UNK> <UNK> american twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do <UNK> things there its just so stupid and so bizarre how can they just find two french guys hit on them and in the end kiss them not knowing anything about them more realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them which could have easily happened in such a situation as for the bit where they make the french president drink <UNK> <UNK> that was just lame i don't think he would have been too pleased in real life everything worked out too easily for the girls and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie if it at all depicted real life br br my rating 0 10
<START> yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks the classic godfather and yet another case of over hype due to media circus <UNK> the 13th hindi film of ram <UNK> <UNK> as director is also the weakest in his underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent <UNK> and company the charisma the <UNK> persona of the two playing father son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest <UNK> point here for which <UNK> should be <UNK> however the same <UNK> of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film reason the other characters look more like cardboard caricatures <UNK> the villains represent the typical bollywood baddies a character who <UNK> attention is elder son played by but again not able to hold due to half baked characterization the drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of close shots which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to <UNK> an ambiance the haunting score <UNK> and the sound design <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> together with dark murky background <UNK> by <UNK> powerful images <UNK> by <UNK> roy contributes to visuals so typical of <UNK> style but there is an <UNK> of music though fortunately no songs are there in the film but can interest of today's intelligently growing audience be <UNK> just on shoulders of two performers and strong visuals i don't think so surely audience more and here film fails to deliver in any adaptation in order to add a new dimension the biggest pre requisite is the screenplay which is <UNK> here not being crisp at places and therefore the pace <UNK> quite often what finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable very <UNK> drama with very little surprise elements top stunt director allan <UNK> is also not in his best form some scenes which require a different treatment includes a minister is talking foul about <UNK> and the son is <UNK> a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on <UNK> <UNK> jr escapes from the <UNK> of his enemies a son easily motivated to kill his own father a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him a police <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr all this requires a more realistic hard hitting approach which is the back bone to create the required conflict the dialogues are weak for <UNK> look at an amateurish line where a <UNK> says to <UNK> jr  <UNK> jo police <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the women folk take on working is completely ignored the <UNK> <UNK> about criminal activities while <UNK> is with his family also look slightly out of place in fact the film follows a <UNK> quite similar to <UNK> own production <UNK> <UNK> in depicting the battle between good and evil the other side of life the law police administration politics is completely ignored certainly more is expected in content here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare dear <UNK> agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank you definitely need to take some <UNK> <UNK> in your film production factory before it is too late
<START> this movie is the worst thing ever created by humans you think <UNK> is the worst movie ever it doesn't even come close to this garbage i dont even know where to begin the russian commander and the rebel <UNK> are the worst actors ever to appear in a movie they make the sister in <UNK> 2 look like meryl streep the goofy faces the <UNK> makes while she's in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed then there is the music during the prison break the totally out of place love scene the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene the fake castro the fact that everybody has either a <UNK> and or a on some part of their body the <UNK> rape scene ever filmed and the worst acting ever put on film this movie deserves to be more well known among bad movie fans definitely the worst movie ever made
<START> lately i've been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present there are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s this movie had all the elements of a decent western a good story with talented actors and everything else although it's a spoof of this genre and for me the way it was done just didn't work and made for a disappointing movie br br this movie can easily be divided into two parts br br the first part is great it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter a k a the stranger going after a <UNK> who is going after a large bank <UNK> <UNK> in part by a <UNK> over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting <UNK> in an attempt to get the money there are subtle comic <UNK> to the <UNK> of earlier films from this genre but the comedy doesn't <UNK> the overall story br br the second half of the film is where the comedy goes over the top and essentially ruins the movie the turning point is right at the part where the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other <UNK> seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place from this point <UNK> the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupid silly spoof br br there are three horrible fist fight scenes one at the river one in the market and one at the <UNK> that follow in rapid succession as if one wasn't bad enough the fighting is so fake it's ridiculous and since the sound is out of sync with the picture it makes it even worse in the market fight scene the <UNK> <UNK> about the place on hidden and <UNK> around on <UNK> like he is in the circus it's <UNK> although the worst part of these fight scenes is the music it's this light hearted <UNK> mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of these scenes practically <UNK> the main story br br overall this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western but the comic turns just <UNK> it up if you want to see a good western spoof then see if you want to see a good spaghetti western then avoid this movie
<START> a ridiculous movie a terrible editing job worst screenplay ridiculous acting a story that is completely br br if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be dead br br a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who think they can make movies br br i am still wondering who are those two girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to us br br
<START> i am sorry to rain on everybody's parade just a little background about me i like and know a lot about asian cinema especially japanese chinese and indian admittedly i am a <UNK> when it comes to south korean cinema but if this is the best of the best sorry i just want you to know that i am not at all narrow minded when it comes to <UNK> foreign movies and i do not fit the stereotype of the dumb american well not perfectly br br i cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is <UNK> upon this is a disgusting and ludicrous movie hammy acting everything is badly done and overdone like begging for the <UNK> viewer's attention horrible camera work with an <UNK> on meaningless close ups derived from the mtv <UNK> br br the plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of swiss cheese nobody expects a thriller to be 100 realistic and for the sake of entertainment i'd be happy to close my eyes to small <UNK> details but excuse me what's happening here that can stand even summary <UNK> this story of an unbelievably intricate and <UNK> act of revenge is worse than the worst <UNK> story one can read in a line at the supermarket don't want to spoil your enjoyment if that's the word so won't go into details of the plot the fighting scenes are violent unbelievable downright stupid the main hero taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time after he only trained while imprisoned <UNK> a wall the truly outstanding features of this movie are two the lurid and incestuous sex brother on sister and father on daughter well we've evolved since <UNK> didn't we and the graphic violence the cut off body parts hands teeth <UNK> together with industrial <UNK> of <UNK> blood how many <UNK> of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made have no function motivation whatsoever br br a feast for the s m inclined admittedly but even for those a feast of no merit nor subtlety heavens even mel <UNK> recent and much discussed work on an almost similar theme wasn't that bad br br the <UNK> good press this pretentious overblown overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from korean <UNK> <UNK> makes me wonder what's happening i don't think of myself as being the ultimate <UNK> of taste and often i am ready to accept that a movie i didn't enjoy may be better than i was able to perceive however i have no <UNK> whatsoever in calling this one as i see it bad bad bad no redeeming qualities my find something better to do with your time
<START> <UNK> is the best movie ever is the best movie i have ever seen the plot was like nothing ever seen or done before these people are truly blessed with a talent no joke i love this movie i need to buy it but i cant find at any place it is a dream for me to go and meet the actors and try and do a <UNK> 2 i rented <UNK> at broadway video and kept it for a week longer than i should have and asked them if i could buy it off of them they said no a big disappointment and an even bigger one the week after i returned it i wanted to go and rent it again but come to find out broadway video was out of business if anyone has the movie or knows where i can buy it at then please tell me write to me at <UNK> com
<START> the debut that <UNK> from obscurity one of the <UNK> stars of contemporary noir is an assured if limited stab at the con game and obsession filmed for zero money nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and <UNK> <UNK> of london to <UNK> his trade given the lack of <UNK> this short <UNK> min is at its best in playing with the audience's and <UNK> expectations about who is <UNK> whom though the initial set up does ring some alarm <UNK> in the credibility <UNK> the <UNK> cinematography he often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly <UNK> up to noir <UNK> though the limitations do show at times br br one can easily see <UNK> style developing in this <UNK> effort many of the same themes of <UNK> identity and expectation <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and insomnia not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans
<START> what a drawn out painful experience br br that's over two hours of my life i will never get back br br this film festival director's delight is <UNK> with <UNK> of the long slow shot however that's not the only thing that makes a script br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> first let me say i'm not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies i love movies for example is also a favorite but this the positive points can be summed up easily the photography is splendid and the music is perfect does it make a good movie i used to think so but this one is a perfect example of one that for me doesn't make it maybe it's because i'm too dumb possible but i don't think so for example also used very long shots but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking and i mean just their heads because in this movie there are a lot of those shots but sometimes it is effective the general result is <UNK> boring even with the intelligent undertones which are done in a way that while intelligent is above all very <UNK> br br you also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic or symbolic effect but just to spare on budget br br i'm very disappointed in this film because i really liked the first 30 minutes or so but it just went on and on without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes br br while reading the very <UNK> comments on this page i also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it when a movie is slow and arty it doesn't necessarily mean it is very profound yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town which is quite interesting on itself but it does not make a profound movie except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it but then it's not what you find in the movie but what you find in yourself an exercise that in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching stalker or <UNK> than <UNK> that owes much to but cab never equal it's level
<START> awful br br despite the good performance of ed harris diane <UNK> and the strong budget the reason for the 3 stars the movie is by far the worst i saw about a composer and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music i agree with some fictional stuff to <UNK> a biography that otherwise couldn't be so charming this was done in <UNK> with best results but this b copy here is a flaw <UNK> had a strong personality but was a sensible artist here in this movie however he looks much more as mike <UNK> i wonder also whether despite his <UNK> he heard all the in the last scenes may be a <UNK> i prefer to listen to the <UNK> on a cd with some nice <UNK> today most of them conduct modern <UNK> <UNK> by the way i gave <UNK> 10 10
<START> the united states built the atomic bomb in order to show their superior military power and to end the second world war the movie fat man and little boy is a portrayal of the efforts of american <UNK> to <UNK> the technology necessary to create the bomb and the tension that existed between the scientists and the military over the potential uses of the bomb and even the of its creation the scientists thought that the bomb should be created as a <UNK> a <UNK> that would halt the war by wasting as little life as possible fist they saw themselves as in a race with german scientists who were attempting to build nuclear weapons themselves when the germans were defeated many scientists hoped to stop work on the bomb project as they knew that the japanese did not have the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon and therefore did not pose a threat of massive loss of life those who <UNK> the <UNK> of the manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used as a <UNK> <UNK> the japanese head of state to view its <UNK> upon some tiny deserted island this massive display of force they felt would be enough to win the war no killing would be needed the us military under the direction of general leslie hoped all along to used the bomb as a actual weapon to be <UNK> against the enemy first against the germans and then against the japanese because of the <UNK> of japanese soldiers on the small japanese islands the us decided to drop the bomb on <UNK> cities in order to end the war first <UNK> and then <UNK> the display of that vast amount of force also served notice to the rest of the world that the us was the <UNK> military power a message aimed especially at russia whose growing military power and economic weight in <UNK> threatened our <UNK> world position fat man and little boy was a movie that had good intentions in mind but muddled them rather badly by the choice of actors script and cinematography one of the main points of the movie was the struggle between the military view of science for killing and the scientific view of science for knowledge the <UNK> of this conflict is the continued <UNK> between general and dr <UNK> mr newman does his job in the part of the general <UNK> <UNK> angry and <UNK> his <UNK> upon the success of the project dwight <UNK> on the other hand never puts up much resistance at all to the <UNK> demands always looking rather weak <UNK> and <UNK> in his audiences john cusack presents a stunningly unsympathetic character in as flat a role as i have ever seen it looks like he is just reading his lines laura dern seems to be suffering from the same none of the characters are helped by the script which is almost <UNK> ridiculous in the way it attempts to explain scientific concepts offers the most unrealistic stock relationship between mr cusack and ms dern imaginable doesn't even give us the cheap thrill of watching the army drop nuclear bombs on japan and relies heavily on voice over a technique that is evil anytime even when explaining a characters true <UNK> thoughts or for the narration of something that cannot be possibly show on the film medium but is used here to read some absolutely trite <UNK> out of <UNK> diary the cinematographer offers us several shots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs which might be striking if it didn't look like they were cardboard <UNK> instead of bombs the fake atomic fire really does look fake and why use it when the stock footage on hand is so genuinely stunning and realistic and the <UNK> brown tone doesn't seem to be <UNK> appropriate besides that it's not a bad movie
<START> why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down it is cute and funny exactly what it is meant to be madonna wasn't out to prove herself as an oscar artist with this movie anyhow she was just doing what the character called for and she did it well i loved her in this movie it is my second favorite madonna movie after <UNK> the soundtrack is excellent too it is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80's flick to all the critics just don't take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it madonna is a <UNK>
<START> if you just watched all dogs go to heaven and learn that there's a sequel don't watch it it's horrible it's absolutely awful they rush the characters to develop <UNK> for example begins singing about how you can count her out for love and at the end this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy adventure film they rip charlie out of his character and replace him with a <UNK> soft but still rebellious version of himself br br the humor behind <UNK> character is just completely lost he's a totally different dog he doesn't have a cool voice anymore he isn't that villain you love to hate anymore he's just a <UNK> voiced by none other than mermaid man from <UNK> speaking of voice actors br br charlie has a completely different voice and while it isn't horrible i don't like it it's terrible in comparison to the excellent job that burt reynolds did for the character in the first film dom <UNK> is wonderful as always as itchy that character stays true and that's why this film gets a 3 10 purely because dom <UNK> was still <UNK> itchy br br oh and my last complaint i know ann <UNK> movie was done and gone she has parents now etc but did charlie completely forget about her or what no mention at all of her in the second film i mean even a small mention from itchy would have been acceptable ex charlie we have to get back you can't take care of every kid that needs <UNK> or something of the sort i mean he died living with her she deserves some kind of mention br br don't watch this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel
<START> i taped the <UNK> murders on lifetime movie network and i watched the <UNK> murders on lifetime lifetime movie network and on <UNK> jonathan and john corbett did a great job of playing luke and walker <UNK> i am glad that walker got his brother luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother bobby i enjoy watching true stories on lifetime lifetime movie network and on <UNK> the <UNK> murders is a good movie to watch next time the <UNK> murders is on lifetime lifetime or <UNK> i am going to watch the murders again because my favorite actor john is in the <UNK> murders i give the <UNK> murders a ten because it is a good movie about walker who tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother bobby and at the end walker discovers it was his brother luke who murdered his parents and his brother bobby
<START> i was pulled into this movie early on much to my surprise because i hadn't intended to watch it at all now i wish i hadn't the suspense starts out well with the hit and run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess or be found out or <UNK> now though a no no in the old days of movie making get away with it the <UNK> been done before what plot hasn't but the tensions inherent in it with the additional complications and motivations <UNK> out of the <UNK> love affair make for an absorbing first half then the film <UNK> the hit and run to <UNK> upon a misty exposition of two <UNK> all suffering loves the two tracks of plot hit and run and <UNK> love just don't have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters doesn't <UNK> them enough to justify the departure from the original story line the screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other at the end of the film in the midst of the movie's second funeral i found myself thinking now what does any of this have to do with that hit and run the filmmakers may think the answer obvious but i think the movie was plotted and executed
<START> i don't think this cartoon was as bad as some may think of course i was only five at the time it came out but i did find it very entertaining at the time and would still give it a look today if given the opportunity batman and robin being voiced by adam west and burt ward was a nice touch and gave it a sense of <UNK> for me as i was also watching re runs of the campy 1960's live action show batman at that age this cartoon also introduced some new twists i had forgotten all about like bat <UNK> for instance looking back on it i'm sure he was likely as annoying as many think but he didn't bother me much at the time the best i can recall his voice sounded like a cross between dumb donald and gee i wonder why anyway give it a look if you can and make up your own mind you might be surprised
<START> typically a movie can have factors like <UNK> good feel sense of purpose plot etc there's always something that can be taken out of movies its just a matter of how compelling the reason is for me to own it in my collection of two sisters as they call it when it was released in my country has tremendous feel and an eventually mostly self explaining plot i love horror movies that <UNK> around a house titles that come to mind are the others the haunting the haunting of hell house this movie will be a another great example that i will remember the movie had extremely rich colour in the way the house was <UNK> in the clothes that the characters wore in the open daylight scenes that is in contrast to most horror movies which typically makes use of <UNK> tones and gloomy <UNK> think <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> dark water which is another show i like that gives this film a sense of <UNK> and joy when it wasn't in its more gripping moments the characters are extremely believable this may be partly attributed to the familiar setting of this movie maybe domestic issues are easier for both myself as well as the actors to identify with and the actors become their characters with exceptional <UNK> the director toys with <UNK> in order to give the audience the story in bits and pieces allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation instead of presenting everything in a linear fashion this is a positive aspect of this film in my opinion and perhaps it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find it enjoyable i would definitely look out for this on dvd
<START> with no dead heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed william sanders is saved by his buddy harry during an <UNK> in vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy fast forward ten years and harry is now a <UNK> russian <UNK> with a mind control <UNK> in his brain his new russian superior is <UNK> played to the obscene <UNK> by nick nicholson who might i add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in kentucky with his <UNK> teeth what is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialog coach for this film soon william is re <UNK> by the cia to hunt harry down he teams up with barbara a freedom fighter who has <UNK> el <UNK> camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of south america some scenes are so jaw <UNK> awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following one such scene is the sudden <UNK> in the jungle by william and barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate background music i've ever heard who would strip completely nude in the middle of a south american jungle there is a rape scene that uses the end theme from blood on <UNK> claw as well no dead heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills in one scene harry his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys i had to <UNK> it and count hard to find film that has recently gotten the full <UNK> treatment by mgm track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues
<START> this is a horrific re make of the french movie ma <UNK> en rose http imdb com title the only scenario that i can imagine in which anyone <UNK> bates butler what were they thinking agreed to be associated with it is <UNK> seeing the original being rightly impressed and <UNK> a friend with no writing credits or talent to his name to translate the themes for american audiences whom they both agreed are stupid stupid stupid then she <UNK> other friends to sign up and they did so as friends certainly not on the merits of this <UNK> contrived everything but the kitchen sink script br br i'm not a <UNK> jerk fan of french film but ma <UNK> en rose is a subtle thoughtful and thought provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues i would love to see it get wider exposure among english speaking audiences and if that means an american re make so be it but <UNK> <UNK> a little respect for the issues and the intelligence of the audience and better direction for the actors who couldn't seem to decide if they were working for <UNK> williams or jerry lewis
<START> this movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war everything about the movie was perfect i just saw the movie yesterday and i want to get my own dvd <UNK> and watch it many times over the story ends as it started i was very happy that he came back and i was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream she <UNK> her father boyfriend husband and her lover the character had many shades christian <UNK> is also an phenomenal actor some stories do have happy endings aside from the love story angle i thought about how a beautiful <UNK> and peaceful island had been affected by war and it made me realize the true <UNK> war can have on its people government makes the decision whereas the people suffer her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams i loved the scene where she is complaining about not getting a <UNK> and i also loved the scene where both lived through the <UNK> they were survivors
<START> to be totally honest i wasn't expecting much at all going into 9 souls even after reading heap upon heap of praise <UNK> upon it but to say i was surprised would be a major understatement in short i was totally blown away br br the basic plot is as simple as they come nine prison inmates ranging from a drug <UNK> all the way up to multiple <UNK> escape from prison and go in search of a secret <UNK> presumed to be <UNK> money hidden by a <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> and was dragged away by guards shortly before their escape but it's the direction that director takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original perfectly <UNK> drama comedy and violence creating a truly one of kind movie that to be seen not only fans of asian cinema but cinema in general br br superbly acted emotional funny violent and at times very surreal this is a movie has it all
<START> this episode introduces us to the <UNK> dress uniforms worn here by captain <UNK> commander <UNK> and lieutenant <UNK> <UNK> the plot of this episode deals with 2 groups of separate alien <UNK> the and the who try to capture and eat each other at every turn the 2 sides really hate each other and it is up to <UNK> and <UNK> to contain them and keep them out of trouble br br meanwhile a mysterious <UNK> <UNK> goes around the ship <UNK> and killing a few of the crew members but at the end of the episode this same <UNK> <UNK> possesses a valuable member of the crowd will they be able to rescue him so that they maybe able to continue on with their on going mission of space exploration br br note this episode marks irish actor <UNK> <UNK> second appearance on <UNK> after encounter at he portrays one of <UNK> yellow <UNK> security guards
<START> the all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring scene was a riot i also <UNK> at the scene in the bar where hyde the horse <UNK> and <UNK> the bird to the japanese guy and said pearl harbor buddy i think my iq is higher than <UNK> but i'm not sure because i can't count that high br br funny thing this 10 line <UNK> seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long not too short i hope i don't make it to 1 000 words before i get to line 10 br br i'm still two lines short <UNK> me while i think and drink or drink and think it depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind good i think i've made it to the 10 line limit thanks for reading
<START> i am a history teacher and overall i was pleased with the movie my teen <UNK> enjoyed it over the holidays is it 100 accurate and is it a little sappy in places yes but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all br br the battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout lloyd bridges as <UNK> davis and hal <UNK> as abraham lincoln stand out we all thought phillip <UNK> as bent was <UNK> and <UNK> brilliant we all thought charles stole the show from <UNK> and george br br we will enjoy the movie again
<START> planet earth has suffered a terrible <UNK> disaster so humanity now survives underground split in to different religious <UNK> what caused the catastrophe i have no idea why is humanity split in to different <UNK> <UNK> i have no idea since the surface of the earth can no longer support human life how are the humans able to grow <UNK> in order to feed the population i have no idea what sort of producer thought this screenplay deserved to receive funding i have no idea br br shepherd is one of these films that creeps up late at night on cable channels the sort of film where you <UNK> the to see if it has any merits the number of people who've on shepherd on this page hasn't yet reached double figures and this is a film that was released nine years ago perhaps the people who have never seen it are the lucky ones br br as for the rest of the plot it's very routine grumpy former cop boris <UNK> whose wife and child died several years previously meets a woman and her child and it's up to him to save their lives almost like a futuristic western throw in a former wrestler who now runs the god channel a fascist christian bloke who's trying to snuff out boris a <UNK> some t a for the sake of it and you've got a mess of a film i guess after seeing this neil <UNK> <UNK> is possibly a <UNK> of cinema in comparison
<START> after all these years i am puzzled as to why julie brown west coast isn't a household name or a hugely famous comedic star she is one of the funniest females on the planet in this spoof she takes on madonna who is one of her favorite targets she is <UNK> a hugely successful singer like madonna who also happened to have documentary truth or dare julie brown spoofs madonna as <UNK> who came from <UNK> the land of <UNK> and beer i remember the segment where she went to <UNK> to visit her family and a grave i don't remember if it was a parent or her pet i remember somebody saying that <UNK> did nothing original she was just <UNK> others i have to say that i hope this spoof documentary is available on dvd somewhere julie brown was at her best mocking and <UNK> others
<START> i saw this movie with my mother and i loved it it was such a sweet story not to mention funny because of the supporting cast they never make movies like this ever my favorite part is when grace <UNK> driver finds out about her <UNK> wife's death and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams what was god thinking i do believe everyone no matter who you believe in has thoughts like that once in awhile but while it's very sappy it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for all sigh br br the comedic timing between bonnie hunt and jim belushi will just make you crack up especially in the aforementioned scene it's terrible and yet so funny they make a good pair and i hope to see them again in something soon 10 10 stars
<START> this is more than a sat afternoon special well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it catch the cat companion <UNK> for instance it not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book the comic industry as well as the film's <UNK> missed the boat on this one of the least know really great films a great script by john <UNK> is a strong point but the acting is good as well probably the best super hero film i've ever seen short on special effects but long on believability this one's a keeper i have never seen a dvd of this film but i used to own a vhs version good hunting
<START> this movie is pretty predictable <UNK> said from the <UNK> kissing scene to the inevitable coming around of grandpa this is a great movie for the 10 12 age group but beyond that it has no market i give it 4 10 only because it achieved exactly what it set out to do and nothing more
<START> this was a pretty good episode though no trapped in the closet or cartoon wars it had a lot of things going for it the character of al gore and that bizarre as hell super <UNK> thing was pretty darn funny but the scene that made me adore this episode was one i'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest <UNK> kyle moments ever when <UNK> is <UNK> of kyle that he'll be stealing his gold which of course is fake and he comes within <UNK> of his face suddenly kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation where <UNK> tries to act like everything is completely fine <UNK> <UNK> out the treasure at the end though predictable was pretty funny
<START> the only reason i didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable <UNK> is boring boring boring and boring this film is just dreadful not because of any violence or graphic <UNK> it's actually quite tame in that regard the story moves at the speed of a lazy <UNK> i have the feeling that director <UNK> scott just <UNK> this one in the actors are all fine they just needed some direction the music score is also very annoying it's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film it does look good but that's not enough reason to see it by the way did i mention that it's boring br br
<START> as a fan of the old doctor who and after the mediocre fox movie i was dubious of this new series of doctor who i gave it a chance though and am so glad i did br br yes some episodes aren't as brilliant as others but they are all enjoyable and yes <UNK> doctor is far from any we've had before but <UNK> doctor is just about the best there is his performance is at times comical at others dramatic sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic br br this and <UNK> <UNK> as rose make this series a cut above the rest <UNK> is also fantastic as <UNK> mum and there is a depth to this series not present previously this series is incredibly powerful especially considering its sci fi i mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a <UNK> prior to this how many times in this <UNK> history have we had moments like those with <UNK> dad the <UNK> doctor and the <UNK> were fantastic so was <UNK> final speech i advise anyone whether a fan of doctor who or even tv drama to buy this set on dvd it truly is fantastic br br now only 4 episodes through the latest series and looking forward to the new i have to say that david doctor is just not as good of course you may disagree but i don't think his doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series i also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last however the return of sarah jane was a fantastic episode a true gem not to say this series is not good just not quite as good br br so whether you like it or not and whether you prefer <UNK> or <UNK> the doctor is back and he's here to stay fantastic almost as many fantastic 's as the doctor
<START> this is a true gem of corny sci fi peter cushing adds a great personality to this <UNK> movie classic br br i particularly like the sound design the weird choppy voices of the creatures and the <UNK> creatures all provide a bizarre backdrop of course the scantily clad babe doesn't hurt either br br
<START> a roger corman rip off assembled for what appears to be virtually zero budget all of the special effects were originally used in battle beyond the stars and i suspect a fair amount of the props costumes and sets were re used from other sources as well the story seems to have been written around these elements so this isn't really a movie as much as it's a <UNK> project third rate star wars junk wasn't needed then or now
<START> this movie sucked on so many levels ever seen the dentist this movie made the dentist look like a masterpiece i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless of course you are really really really really really bored then maybe it was so corny the killer reminds you of the grandpa from the monsters except he has <UNK> on when jessica said i want you to meet someone my inner bitch i thought she was going to kick his butt however all she did was throw a gen trash can at him i was very disappointed and when the ranger had the crying scene about his wife i so felt the pain behind his tears not so before watching this movie grab a <UNK> and a <UNK> get comfortable because it is very relaxing
<START> while the film has one redeeming feature namely some striking shots e g the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree the scene of the funeral <UNK> on the raft or the scene of the <UNK> leaving the village which seemed influenced by the scene when the <UNK> approach in the fantastic fellini <UNK> these were more <UNK> than cinematographic and would have been better appreciated hung on a wall in an art gallery than <UNK> in a painfully slow paced film that comes in at a <UNK> minutes and suffers from terrible dialogue extremely poor character development over acting uninspired symbolism and heavy <UNK> this is the first film i have seen by <UNK> and his reputation having <UNK> him i expected a lot better but can honestly say that this is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i won't go out of my way to watch any of the director's other work in the future the four friends i went to see it with agree
<START> the film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch i am the first one to agree that victor fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy i also agree that the film has some odd <UNK> and some scenes don't work well so what if it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares does every film have to make sense does every film have to be perfect no a person could get <UNK> <UNK> that they love this film again so what it's got lovable characters it's well shot the acting is mostly good it never becomes too <UNK> or dramatic it's quirky look at how many people love i dream of <UNK> is it perfect heck no and while this is very different i say check it out and you'll be in a good mood after you see it
<START> i was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange i was confused sad and happy in the same moment i guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie but i hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it the story of two friends linked by their suffers of <UNK> <UNK> whom as a team beat the medical well fare system and fight for their rights this movie shows a side which some of us would never understand not too exaggerated but emotional presented hopefully this movie will help us to understand some of their desires better and realize how important it is to have a friend in the world especially when you almost unable to express that fact
<START> <UNK> of a beauty features a gang of <UNK> <UNK> gang <UNK> a woman and they drug her and later on she dies and returns as this big slimy monster with a huge penis that has sharp teeth and also a big sloppy <UNK> crazy film but not very good the gore doesn't come until the last 20 minutes and most of the film is a standard soft core sex with lots of rape worth checking out unfortunately heavily <UNK> <UNK> and nowhere near as much fun as <UNK> of a virgin
<START> well it wasn't a complete waste <UNK> was as usual very good in the movie the whole <UNK> vs german thing was kind of strange because i remember seeing <UNK> at the beginning of the movie bother to go back and check the central theme is about the serial killings with the whole gang <UNK> loosely woven in never saw a movie where the characters looked italian supposed to be taking english american accent and <UNK> with german words the climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts of it that still did not make sense to me in any case if you have nothing else better to do you can watch this movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> as director of cartoons for mgm was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the <UNK> moments in cartoon history his cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with many weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie the mask eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl impossible stunts and non stop action were the <UNK> of these films br br this is one of several <UNK> cartoons that <UNK> was responsible for and it's among his best <UNK> is a <UNK> and he is determined to get his man though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison throughout the film despite many insane stunts <UNK> keeps up with this crook until eventually the wolf gives up because <UNK> is seemingly everywhere full of funny gags and loaded with laughs this is a great cartoon
<START> and i would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for the seriously uneven irish accent of barbara <UNK> in the leading role of mother the accent came and went unfortunately which i found more than a little distracting br br however the performance of william l <UNK> in the role of was outstanding he brought a warmth and depth to the character in spite of some <UNK> hokey dialogue captivating and genuine i found him quite astonishing in the way he captured the character br br the premise of the film is fairly simple the building of a forgotten <UNK> in a church it is based rather loosely i believe on a true story and i had heard of this <UNK> prior to seeing the movie br br it was a phenomenal <UNK> feat for its time a floating double <UNK> made without nails or <UNK> it exists to this day although it is now in private <UNK> br br minor spoiler good supporting cast and barbara does dying so well in all her movies and here she doesn't disappoint lots of special moments br br 7 10
<START> the western can be divided into many sub genres one of the <UNK> <UNK> is that between town westerns and <UNK> westerns most westerns are a mix of both but at one end of the spectrum you have pictures like high <UNK> and <UNK> bravo that take place almost entirely in a <UNK> seldom <UNK> out into the real <UNK> at the other end you have ones like <UNK> master where there is barely a <UNK> on view amid the wilderness br br director john ford normally <UNK> on the bit of both westerns shooting the interiors with an emphasis on their being small and confined and then <UNK> this with the wide open <UNK> which appeared both exciting and dangerous <UNK> master has a typical frank <UNK> script with some interplay between seasoned <UNK> and green youngsters but still it presents ford with some fresh challenges in this picture the dangers do not come from the <UNK> of the landscape they come from within the group in the form of the what's more the absence of real interior scenes means the <UNK> could lose its impact over time br br however ford was a real <UNK> when it came to <UNK> space he shoots scenes of the camp or the <UNK> so the frame is surrounded and we get that same sense of <UNK> as we would in a genuine interior also compared to his other westerns he does not in fact open out the space too much having the <UNK> trail its way through <UNK> and passes rather than cross the stark and empty <UNK> one of the few moments where he does throw the landscape wide open is when the indians are spotted and there is the possibility of a threat from outside br br <UNK> master features some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief and some great <UNK> from the quirky cast harry carey jr was <UNK> up into a fine actor like his <UNK> and this is one of his better early roles <UNK> <UNK> was disappointing in she wore a yellow <UNK> but she appears more at ease as a character with a bit of <UNK> and is actually fairly good here jane <UNK> who won an oscar in the john ford directed <UNK> of wrath a decade earlier appears here with sole function of performing a running gag in which she sounds a feeble old horn still with her great timing and movement she makes the piece work francis ford in one of the many mute <UNK> roles he played in his little brother's pictures is at his <UNK> best br br and now we come to lead man ben johnson although he was by no means a bad actor he was never going to become a big star like john wayne and yet with his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> he was one of the most <UNK> west players around and this brings me onto my final point this was apparently one of ford's personal favourites despite it seeming fairly <UNK> <UNK> master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity it is simply the genre playing itself out i think this is what ford loved about it it's a picture for the ben <UNK> and the harry carey not the john <UNK> or the henry small in scope but worthy in its class
<START> maybe it's unfair to dislike a movie for what it isn't rather than what it is but i approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about small town rural gay men and women instead the focus is primarily on the outrageous <UNK> big news of the locals and those in areas and the really gruesome torture murder of a young gay man br br so much time devoted to stupid people <UNK> about aids sin <UNK> and <UNK> so much time devoted to the <UNK> preacher <UNK> about the bible and gay people getting what they deserve br br i wanted to see more of the people that came to the small town gay bar not those who opposed it in addition the young man who was murdered isn't even from this town br br the whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration and it's very suspect
<START> george known as a director of women couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film itself a remake of bette <UNK> campy old <UNK> written by john van <UNK> this film is definitely dated but still delightful br br <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as best friends who compete at everything but manage to remain friends liz hamilton <UNK> is a serious writer intellectual and elegant she meets her <UNK> best friend merry <UNK> at an <UNK> girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition later in their lives when liz is a promising but <UNK> writer of serious fiction merry decides to try her hand at writing which <UNK> her pal because of <UNK> casual approach to the craft she herself takes perhaps a little too seriously br br much to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> trashy novels hit pay dirt and ultimately her old friend liz is judging her novel for the national book award <UNK> steals the show as the <UNK> writer of steamy <UNK> who schemes to bring together the broken pieces of her life in <UNK> with her final literary triumph but alas things are never that simple br br the supporting cast includes david <UNK> whom you might remember as the tragic quentin collins from dark shadows hart <UNK> and of course a deliciously young and <UNK> meg ryan in her first film role since leaving the <UNK> br br rich and famous is <UNK> campy witty and wise it <UNK> in a new years fiasco that <UNK> the enduring nature of true friendship and i never let a year go by without watching it on new years eve watch it and you'll see why
<START> warner brothers produced this 3d <UNK> that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953 guy madison leads a band of soldiers and <UNK> to rescue two white women being held by indians which essentially all there is to this film the 3d format was in its early stages as a hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television and the effects work very well here the <UNK> make off with the ladies and are pursued by the indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed the indian <UNK> comes at the audience non stop throughout and a <UNK> of <UNK> juice aimed at a <UNK> is thrown in for good measure madison was quite popular as <UNK> wild bill <UNK> and is good as a <UNK> cattle <UNK> who is given his <UNK> task by the army for all the film's polish and presentation the movie was made in just three days
<START> sex is comedy though not driven by a fantastically imaginative plot concentrates effectively on the relationship between film director and crew during the process of film making whilst successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and more specifically the issues and problems encountered by actors involved in filming sex scenes director features <UNK> throughout for it is she who carries the plot forward in the place of a narrator and gives us numerous little <UNK> of wisdom to think about she is a social <UNK> relating to her assistant and others the problems she finds with her new male lead by way of <UNK> him with a <UNK> stereotype their ambiguous relationship <UNK> something about human nature  the tendency to be <UNK> on one hand the two seem close when he is not in sight she claims to hate him <UNK> also <UNK> his <UNK> pride perhaps in a feminist take on things br br the taboo of what <UNK> <UNK> is raised the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful because it is <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> that is the director's justification this is however <UNK> ironic for the film we watch is in itself a <UNK> within a <UNK> br br there's more to this film than just relationships of course watching this film is not simply a question of <UNK> it for the sake of drawing out some sort of meaning one can delight in the natural lighting which <UNK> the movie this makes it realistic and believable a static camera is sometimes used taking in a heavy composition and at times the camera appears shaky like a home movie if you're looking for something fun to watch on a sunday afternoon that isn't too heavy but still leaves you thinking this is it
<START> to be honest i did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all i can compare to the first part <UNK> and this one here is really disappointing compared to <UNK> as well as compared to most other movies i watched the last weeks the first minutes <UNK> to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse there are a few good funny scenes but in total it is just another boring second rate try of german film industry that cannot succeed nearly as usual one good thing the movie is quite short 75 min the bad thing it only contains story and jokes for 45 minutes don't watch it
<START> i've noticed that a lot of people are taking opera to task for the way betty <UNK> to the murders i think they are <UNK> these complaints on how they imagine a normal person would react the thing is betty is not a normal person due to traumatic events in her childhood she has problems way way before the movie ever even starts and by the end of opera in my opinion she has become totally unhinged br br spoilers you have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mother's lover commit at least one brutal murder while her mother was getting off watching it br br she was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to death that does not make for a healthy home life i think it's pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative <UNK> to ensure that her daughter never on her it is also likely that at her <UNK> age betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw is this just something that adults do etc br br betty obviously looks up to her mother i mean she's become an opera singer just like her if <UNK> likes it it can't be bad can it <UNK> can't be bad can she she couldn't tell the police on her <UNK> or this mysterious <UNK> fellow she associates with <UNK> br br betty has a lot of deep <UNK> emotional issues her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doing but it keeps coming to the surface <UNK> itself in the form of horrible nightmares skull <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> on <UNK> techniques and sexual she associates brutal violence bloody death with sex on a <UNK> level there's an inner struggle between the part of betty that has confused murder sex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrong br br after she's seen her boyfriend murdered by the <UNK> man she calls the police yet is unwilling to give her name the part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call but the part that is <UNK> won't allow her to admit personal involvement the <UNK> part of her takes control before she can go all the way so she walks away from the phone in the rain and when she's picked up by the director she's acting surprisingly calm not as upset as you would think a normal person would be because the part of her that's been <UNK> stuff since she was a child is trying its to block the horror of what she's just witnessed br br the state of affairs in her life all contribute to an <UNK> within <UNK> psyche her singing career is starting to bear fruit she's going to be a great opera singer like her mother was but is she going to become like her mother in all ways in the darker ways or will she be able to make her own path add this to the re <UNK> of the <UNK> man murdering everyone around her br br it's not until the <UNK> man kills daria character that betty really takes an active role in <UNK> the killer here's someone who loves betty who's supported her <UNK> in her <UNK> career who is in fact a <UNK> figure in <UNK> life now since <UNK> dead imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the <UNK> br br i could go on but i won't the main <UNK> of what i'm saying is that the character of betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledge br br opera is one of <UNK> best and not just for the visuals alone although they are truly magnificent and not just for the inventive murders although they are there is a depth here and attention needs to be paid
<START> i watched this on hbo because it won the oscar a week earlier it <UNK> <UNK> with fictional courtroom dramas br br the story is of a 15 year old black kid placed on trial for the <UNK> murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the <UNK> by the <UNK> husband and on a confession that the defense <UNK> was <UNK> br br about half the footage is of the trial it's <UNK> with footage of the defense lawyers two public <UNK> explaining their case <UNK> witnesses and visiting key locations this is edited with a minimum of needless <UNK> and placed in logical order the camera work is pretty solid and there's a mildly surprising <UNK>
<START> this film reminds me very much of the later rock hudson film man's favorite sport about a fishing writer who has never <UNK> and is forced into entering a fishing <UNK> in this case barbara stanwyck is a martha stewart like writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her <UNK> in fact she has no family at all well like rock she is <UNK> into performing in this case creating a huge holiday dinner while <UNK> in the countryside since there is no family she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately not to let the cat out of the bag that she can't do any of the things she is known for doing a cute little comedy and a welcome film to the <UNK> holiday film <UNK>
<START> after attack of the fifty foot woman with alison hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than dorothy from it's a mad mad mad mad world to play the role the is that cute and blonde may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into allison size 50 shoes this role really needed someone with an amount of <UNK> sex appeal is more the girl next door type she may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy but the material lets her down lou <UNK> however proves he can do a movie without bud <UNK> feeding him lines and he even a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to <UNK> gordon as his front man for gags gordon however <UNK> that all he can be is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> much the same character he creates later on the lucy show charles lane also plays the same role in everything he does a straight man and his screen time is limited the special effects are convincing for the time but i would have liked dorothy to have been a little more than <UNK> and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous as the movie's lead character she takes second billing to <UNK> who is in all of the movie with dorothy several times <UNK> like a sub plot the whole movie put together just can't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction a comedy or just a parody of the allison hayes classic there's a lot of good scenes some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film still i do like this movie for it's <UNK> of women there's not enough movies out there like this one if this movie had a chance to be remade today i'd highly recommend <UNK> cox and jason alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely re write the original script <UNK> tops my lists of actresses who i believe could and should adequately play gorgeous although i have to admit that if either of the titanic <UNK> allison or dorothy came after me i'd go quietly
<START> as a big fan of most modern fantasy movies i was really looking forward to this i was not familiar with the character although after hearing some general stories about the style of the comic and good reviews of the movie i thought i was in for a real treat br br from the moment that the lead character started to talk in his forced <UNK> voice i could tell straight away that i was not going to enjoy this movie i found the story weak and predictable the acting poor the effects were very good for a small budget film but did nothing for the overall plot br br maybe as a fan of the comics you may get something more from this otherwise i would suggest that you skip it and not waste you cinema fare on this boring adventure
<START> 1 men over the age of 25 that refer to themselves without irony as having game or being either a player or a <UNK> gentlemen from here on in it's a swift descent into starring in your own real life version of a night at the <UNK> br br 2 saying the v i p the term v i p in and of itself isn't bad but when <UNK> by the it instantly becomes part of the <UNK> <UNK> this goes double for white people br br 3 people that make tv shows based on stuff that they don't know isn't cool and then go on imdb posing as fans right moreover one of whom is from the united states hey me too to <UNK> insult members of their potential audience for inevitably thinking their show sucks minus 1 additional <UNK> point if they employ any variation on the oh snap nice one <UNK> justification that if you don't like the show you obviously can't get laid br br 4 canadian hip hop r b sensation a random addition to the list at first glance but at the end of the day gets the gas face for the simple reason that his particular brand of low rent american <UNK> <UNK> and general <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the overall sensibility of keys to the v i p br br 5 last but not least keys to the v i p for all the above reasons and more
<START> that's what i felt like yelling as well as <UNK> out of the theater but i restrained myself yes the acting was great no this wasn't the typical hollywood film but the dialogue just wouldn't end or get interesting and despite all the <UNK> you never get to really know or care about any of the characters definitely the most boring film i've seen since <UNK> but i was expecting that one to be boring i had to sit through it but please spare yourself
<START> howard kevin kline teaches english at the high school in a small indiana city he is finally getting married to emily joan cusack much to his parents delight the town is <UNK> too because one of its own cameron matt dillon has been nominated for an acting oscar everyone including howard and emily is watching the academy awards on television as cameron is <UNK> the winner in his acceptance speech cameron <UNK> that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man in part because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school you guessed it its howard but howard has never come out in fact he believes he is straight with the whole town and members of the media waiting and <UNK> the happenings will howard and emily go ahead and get married or is howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony this is a wonderful funny and <UNK> film about a gay man and his situation as the man who did not realize he was gay kline is excellent and touching the rest of the cast is equally fine with cusack a <UNK> as the mixed up fiancé and dillon bob <UNK> debbie reynolds tom <UNK> and others on hand to delight the audience as well the costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana <UNK> is beautiful then too the script the direction and the production are very very nice but the insightful humorous and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film's best asset no doubt for those who would be offended by a gay themed film yes just skip over this one but for everyone who wants to laugh <UNK> and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time this is definitely the best film out there
<START> as much as i love the story of david <UNK> i cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie it was probably the second worst movie i have ever seen one problem i see is that the <UNK> of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours rather than a regular movie it is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours i <UNK> not enjoy the brooding flashback format it was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp also i don't think the filmmakers interpreted personality correctly the idea of him <UNK> around on a beach <UNK> about his life seems inconsistent with the forward thinking nature dickens gave him in the novel <UNK> also bothered me she came across as a <UNK> household decoration rather than a strong woman <UNK> was perfect however this movie was <UNK> with problems and i wait eagerly for someone to make a decent screen version
<START> i wasn't planning on watching wasted when i saw the mtv preview but since i had nothing better to do or watch on a sunday night i watched it br br wasted was no <UNK> for a dream but it was a very good movie considering it was made by mtv one thing that drew me to watching it was summer <UNK> the sister of the late and wonderful river <UNK> <UNK> i suppose talent runs in the <UNK> family because she was good and so is though are river nick <UNK> also gives a great <UNK> as a <UNK> jock there isn't much else to say about wasted it was a dark depressing and insightful look into the lives of three small town <UNK> i <UNK> it to those who like the subject 8 10
<START> american <UNK> jules <UNK> makes an award winning french gangster film the plot involves tony the a <UNK> just out of prison who takes his band of thieves on a <UNK> million jewel heist unfortunately his ex wife's relationship with a notorious gangster named an italian safe cracker named <UNK> with a weakness for women and the <UNK> of his own friend jo cause the successful heist to turn into a bloody race against time as holds <UNK> son hostage for the cash in typical crime never pays tragedy fashion br br the <UNK> in the title is explained in a song to mean <UNK> for basically violence and sex and the full title du <UNK> <UNK> les means roughly some naughty in the house of men which is pretty much where the fatal flaw of the characters take place leave it to a gangster film to place most of the emphasis on the <UNK> on the women but this time <UNK> wife gets the last laugh if you could call it a laugh when she <UNK> all of you are just going to kill each other the characters aren't the most sympathetic and the women are mostly weak but <UNK> still builds an extremely well crafted suspense film out of them as they pull off a heist that requires the <UNK> quiet hide the goods and then attempt to survive what basically becomes a cross country cat and mouse game in the mix are some very amazing photography and a fine attention to detail in editing leading to a pacing and visual experience that well <UNK> the otherwise generic plot it's not only easy to see why this is held as a classic it's also easy to see why it's among the top 250 on the imdb it's suspenseful visually magnificent full of sex and violence and maintains that classy gangster attitude we film buffs like so much
<START> after i first saw this i thought wow this is the most spectacular movie visually speaking i've ever seen since that time i've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department i'm just disgusted the long <UNK> dvd was so poorly done the quality of this transfer hardly better than the vhs tape br br the jungle scenes are filmed in <UNK> and lush is the best <UNK> to describe what you see except for jungle sounds seeing is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no hearing no dialog until tarzan christopher <UNK> befriends ian <UNK> and vice versa so be ready for that if you haven't watched this film br br story wise all i'll say is this is not the tarzan many of us came to know in johnny <UNK> films but that's not a complaint for those <UNK> action and don't care about cinematography as i do you just have to get past that silent introduction period br br in this tarzan version our hero goes back to scotland his roots <UNK> to that environment for the most part and a little too quickly for credibility frankly and then returns to the jungle without jane this is supposedly more true to the tarzan books written by edgar rice <UNK> br br the special effects in here were done by rick baker one of the best in the business sharp dvd or not this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes
<START> actor turned director <UNK> <UNK> the sum of all fears does an above average screen version of the novel everything is <UNK> by author jonathan <UNK> <UNK> this tale of journey and self discovery is <UNK> by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that <UNK> and <UNK> the soul br br jonathan <UNK> <UNK> wood is a young man who has seen his grandfather <UNK> pass away jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little <UNK> and <UNK> them in plastic <UNK> to display them on his wall <UNK> gives jonathan an old picture showing a young <UNK> standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago thus jonathan <UNK> on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the <UNK> not knowing if she is still alive he <UNK> the help of a <UNK> young tour guide named alex eugene and his grandfather boris to drive him to his goal at first the trip hits dead ends and false leads but as the group <UNK> its target the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town there they find their own respective <UNK> and will be forever changed by what they learn br br this film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors at times the film is spoken in russian and seems like a foreign film the title itself is a play on self discovery this is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past and his past ironically involves his companions <UNK> obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for alex and his grandfather as well it's a tale of bonding over the long <UNK> and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime by the end of the film these characters have all experienced life <UNK> events that will <UNK> <UNK> their lives it proves that memories can be powerful in <UNK> and also <UNK> the soul it's also about one's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told br br the story is <UNK> simple it functions as a road trip movie like the straight story combined with an interesting mystery story it really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present the ending is a bit surreal with its <UNK> <UNK> feeling br br <UNK> wood sin city the eternal sunshine of the <UNK> mind has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his <UNK> in the lord of the rings trilogy here he does a fine job with what is essentially a <UNK> role with not much to show eugene and boris fare better as alex and his grandfather respectively even the <UNK> dog named sammy davis jr jr that's right is funny as a <UNK> loyal companion br br the spare music score by paul is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film the editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and <UNK> effortlessly the cinematography by matthew <UNK> <UNK> for a dream is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath br br the <UNK> that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too <UNK> we never fully understand the whole background story of <UNK> grandfather and what his motivations are likewise <UNK> blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man at times the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed but these are minor criticisms of what is a good <UNK> story with good performances and interesting themes of <UNK> and closure that <UNK> not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future
<START> this is a classic animated film from the cartoon series most of the major characters get alot of screen time plus do extra characters <UNK> the film s focus is on the superstar characters vacation and each one has his her very unique summer fun its very funny from beginning to end it has excellent color great music and believe it or not i have seen this more than any movie its that great and in my opinion its perfect
<START> this movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three <UNK> among the passengers is convicted serial killer richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his nemesis <UNK> cole <UNK> while the survivors of the wreck are getting their <UNK> an <UNK> of all three <UNK> happens shortly afterwards scary creatures begin to appear and start to pick off the crew members one by one during the <UNK> <UNK> comes into his own as his <UNK> have been <UNK> <UNK> giving him night vision the crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety br br this is a very stylish film with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene giving it a very strange look <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant as <UNK> truly menacing but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat there is also an underlying humour in his performance as well which adds another dimension to the character this is the sort of role that <UNK> excels in the anti hero <UNK> character is not as one dimensional as first appears i can imagine no one else in this role it could have been written specifically for him br br roll on chronicles of <UNK>
<START> i'm sure all of the <UNK> on imdb are all too familiar with canadian content and how much of it is well shall we say lackluster there are a <UNK> few canadian shows that are actually worth watching however this is definitely one of them br br simple premise two guys picking up girls in a bar with certain <UNK> and rules add in some witty and clever commentary from a group of surprisingly likable self <UNK> <UNK> males and you have yourself some very entertaining programming each episode is solid if the players are sub par there are some awkward moments to be had and there is some gentle fun <UNK> at them if the players are good it leads to moments that you just have to stand up and applaud and some comical praise <UNK> at them br br the premise is kind of trashy i know and as a guy who usually takes pride in the fact that i'm <UNK> himself above typical terrible reality television it takes a lot for me to admit that this show is actually funny and enjoyable br br one thing that must be pointed out is how the comedy network did a terrible job marketing this show for the longest time i didn't even know the premise and all i knew was that there was somehow a <UNK> guy who loves involved however after actually watching the show i was surprised by how surprisingly slick it looks for canadian content despite a pretty lame opening credits sequence so give it a chance i have yet to find someone in the target <UNK> 18 30 year old males who have actually watched the show and not just the annoying commercials who hasn't liked it br br bring it back for a third season comedy network it actually has a good premise as opposed to some other canadian shows you've had <UNK> girls will be girls <UNK> i usually <UNK> 10 10 ratings for works of art but i just have so much fun watching this show and i think that it has been unfairly judged my many that i just had to
<START> while i score the movie a 7 i also should point out that it is both interesting historically as it stars mae <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and lionel barrymore when they were all younger and less well known and features pretty exciting action for its day br br the plot is odd for a western in that all the trouble with the indians begins for the <UNK> reason i have ever seen the indians decide to have a giant dog <UNK> no they are not feeding dogs but feeding on dogs and when two indians arrive late there are not left so they steal two dogs <UNK> to two <UNK> from the nearby white <UNK> and this actually touches off an all out war not only is this silly but seems to play on the prejudices of audiences i don't know if american indians actually ate dog but it sounds like the sort of stereotype that later was applied to other ethnic groups all this over dogs the movie has some excellent battle scenes and exciting moments such as when ms <UNK> <UNK> across the battlefield to save a baby exciting stuff but strange too
<START> shame is a swedish film in swedish with english subtitles the film is about a husband and wife named jan and eva they live on an island working as <UNK> there is a war going on and soldiers start attacking people on the island once the war <UNK> a little jan and eva are arrested as going along with the opposite side once released even more trouble ensues and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death winner of the award for best foreign film at the cinema writers circle awards the award for best actress <UNK> <UNK> who plays eva at the awards the award for best foreign language film and best actress at the national board of review and the award for best actress best director <UNK> bergman and best film at the national society of film critics awards shame has good direction a good script good performances by both max von <UNK> who plays jan and <UNK> <UNK> who plays eva good cinematography and good production design shame is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive the film has a powerful message and is a good film the reason <UNK> not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other <UNK> bergman films like wild <UNK> the seventh seal or persona for example the film didn't have as big an impact on me as i thought it would and it lacked <UNK> <UNK> thoughtful and philosophical dialog while nowhere close to being one of his best films there is still a lot to like about shame and it is a good movie i just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other bergman masterpieces
<START> the reason i think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion from the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are you understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others you can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once you see humanity at its best and at it's worst you can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and <UNK> in them that you see in yourself to a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters i will say that i have have never ever cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something i <UNK> you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart that there is only one true thing and that is love
<START> on its surface this is one of the most <UNK> entertaining action comedy romance films i've seen in a long time reminding me of <UNK> old saturday afternoon movies that had just the right balance of unexpected twists well timed humor and integrated action beyond this though there is our knowledge of this film's context it has the same elements of casablanca but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country and the world and the consequences of some of their own behavior this adds a strong note of irony to the humor we sense that one of the female characters has a radical change of <UNK> in her future this is a film that you will not regret watching
<START> the china syndrome is a perfectly paced thriller and not slow or boring at all as some people tend to say the transitions from one scene to another are great and the tension build up in the film will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours jack lemmon is great as always as the somewhat nervous plant <UNK> and jane fonda succeeds again in bringing some real emotions into the story you can see this film as a political statement of the time or just as an intelligently made thriller either way it is definitely worth watching
<START> low budget <UNK> <UNK> gordon lewis reaches a new low even for him with the gore gore girls a <UNK> <UNK> that possesses all of his technical <UNK> badly recorded sound poor lighting and <UNK> gore this would be tolerable even a bit charming if the film at least had an interesting plot blood feast in all its ridiculous glory is a fine example but girls is a total <UNK> completely unlikable pompous ass private investigator abraham <UNK> frank is <UNK> by a newspaper reporter to find out who's been murdering out of shape <UNK> you'll stop caring who the <UNK> is long before these two are <UNK> up the case as before the appeal isn't the plot but the creative methods of <UNK> including a girl's <UNK> being with a wooden <UNK> and the occasional flashes of then <UNK> skin but this just isn't enough to elevate the material above tedium
<START> wow is all i could say i really loved the movie and one thing i could say to aaron carter is that i really think that you should be in a lot more movies cause you rock i love aaron carter so much hes hot and so i say thank you a lot for making this movie great i really do so wish he would be able to make a lot more movies because he his a great dancer actor and singer i so wish i could sing as good as he could and i've been a fan of his for like ever and i will never ever stop loving him i rented the movie and i've had it for two days and <UNK> literally watched it over like 10 times laugh out loud you could call me crazy but that just proves that i liked it a lot if u wanna talk you can hit me up at <UNK> com so e mail me if you wanna i love you aaron carter
<START> eh it's not really as good as the other the villains are actually rip offs of other z villains like cell and even <UNK> with baby being clone super 17 being clone and the shadow dragons being clone s the story is also very bad as it deals with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it deals with him <UNK> to like the size of an eight year old just to get it going let us not forget how weak the characters become can't go <UNK> anymore and is even weaker than pan it's sad i know speaking of pan she was so cute at the end of z now she's lost all that <UNK> and become an irritating whiny little girl whose sole purpose in this series is to get in the way <UNK> doesn't even have a purpose in the series and <UNK> well i don't know what to say about <UNK> <UNK> is just an attempt to milk the popular <UNK> franchise if you really like <UNK> then avoid this series it doesn't even feel like <UNK> i will be fair though as the ending however was really good and is actually pretty sad at least to me and the theme songs both ending and opening are better japanese not american <UNK> been better if san worked on it
<START> a british teen movies which <UNK> around a girl <UNK> accidentally creating her dream man jake in by the use of a virtual reality machine there is only one problem <UNK> not just <UNK> she gets trapped inside his body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust it sounds a lot worse than it is i found it more watchable for the reason that laura <UNK> was starring in it more than the film content indeed she looks stunning throughout especially when she dresses in a red <UNK> dress in order to impress jake wow if only i had a virtual reality
<START> this comment will probably have spoilers i checked the spoilers box just in case but it might not have spoilers but be aware anyways if i say something that you might consider a spoiler and i don't wow best game since super mario 64 i got this game the first day it came out and before i got it i went on some <UNK> <UNK> to look at its ratings yes they already reviewed it before it came out and i was shocked i was expecting something like sunshine because lately all the mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse but this one totally beat the other games the scores on this game even beat <UNK> 3 it's simply amazing br br story not the best mario games are never known for their plots and this one isn't really much of a difference <UNK> once again kidnaps <UNK> but this time <UNK> the <UNK> kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying <UNK> and it shoots <UNK> on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer space br br graphics absolutely gorgeous the best graphics on <UNK> so far the water effects are really nice too if you ever see the water it looks so real because the effects they put in it br br music simply amazing the music in this game is <UNK> not all of it but even the ones that aren't <UNK> still sound very nice br br <UNK> very entertaining keeps you wanting to play more and more and for me since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot i mean i'm definitely not the only one but this game for me didn't have that a lot now it still kind of did but not to the point like mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad this one never did that br br difficulty there are two types of difficulty because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars which i think is kind of easy but to beat the game 100 you have to get <UNK> like always and that quest is way harder but at the same time still very fun br br length good length definitely not too short it took me around 15 16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars but <UNK> took me more like 45 50 hours now i didn't play it constantly that much i played first a lot one day then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day then the next two days i played it all day to me though i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short so if you want a long game i suggest getting all of them br br presentation now the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb the way they are it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any mario game so far br br overall this game is definitely a great game and i advise you to not wait until christmas get it as soon as possible this game also is a good mixture of old and new you'll have some levels where you move just side to side or up and down because they'll change on gravity but even the music has some old classics in it so this game seems to be like a masterpiece to me it's my favorite mario game of all time but others may disagree but it's still a great game i recommend every <UNK> who wants to have fun in a game to get this
<START> when i was a kid i remembered this show but thought that now as an adult the show might be a bit dated well yes it is but for me that makes the show more retro and the <UNK> very funky br br this show is mostly well written i do think its a travesty that this show was cancelled after one season especially when this show was more popular than the incredible hulk br br i think fans should overlook the poor special effects and enjoy the stories br br this next sentence contains spoilers my favourite episode as a kid was when there were two <UNK> that battle against each other interestingly a similar idea is <UNK> in <UNK> 3 the movie i liked the ideas in this tv show some will hate it i believe stan lee wasn't a fan
<START> gary cooper michael brandon played the role as an american millionaire who had seven bad <UNK> but always divorced his wife's with plenty of money to live on michael is in paris on business and goes into a french department store to buy a pair of tops and the sales people refuse to sell him just the tops he has to buy the <UNK> or there is no sale nicole <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to this conversation and offers to buy the bottom of these <UNK> michael becomes very interested in nicole and they have occasion to meet and go on dates it is not too long before michael <UNK> marriage to nicole and she is very taken back with his request for marriage since she really does not know him very well however once she finds out she is going to become the <UNK> wife of michael she begins to change her mind and this story becomes quite entertaining and funny don't miss this film it is great entertainment by great veteran actors enjoy
<START> i have certainly not seen all of jean <UNK> films but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women <UNK> which if you like that sort of thing is not bad but this is a major departure and could almost be <UNK> minus the bio mechanical nightmarish stuff except it's in french with subtitles of course a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her <UNK> and and picks her up while in the background yet another woman <UNK> wearing nothing as they drive along it's obvious that there is something not right about the woman in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen still though that doesn't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris his apartment the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this <UNK> <UNK> a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower where others of her kind for whom the <UNK> things seems to be the least of their problems are being held for some reason time and events march by in the movie which involve mostly trying to find what's going on and get out of the building for this woman and she does manage to call robert the guy that picked her up in the first place to come rescue her the revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie which has a rather strange yet touching end to it in avoiding what seemed to be his typical formula <UNK> created in this what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film i like this one a lot check it out 8 out of 10
<START> this movie was absolutely terrible the only explanation i can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast it was actually painful to watch this movie even my <UNK> ages 6 13 could not bear to watch it as far as i know this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason it's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said hey let's make a movie who wants to be in it it's that bad besides luke perry who is only in a small part of the movie i did not recognize a single other actor that's not necessarily a bad thing but it is in this case i liked i and i generally like stupid and silly movies but this movie doesn't have a single redeeming quality the people who wrote it don't have the slightest clue as to how children think talk or act and the movie is a disjointed mess of terribly corny lines and stupid jokes i rarely write negative reviews but this is the worst movie i have seen since man's best friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies i have ever seen in my life if you rent it remember that i warned you the fact that some people actually rated this movie as being good is a sad commentary on their taste and intelligence i'm not <UNK>
<START> i see absolutely nothing funny even remotely funny in this stupid movie an unrealistic silly ridiculous idea just completely ridiculous hard to believe that the main character who seems so <UNK> intelligent and imaginative would not be accepted to any college even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down the actors portrayed characters straight out of we have seen their lot many a time over in many films nothing new here i found it on late night tv and since there was really nothing else on i watched the whole boring stupid film what a total waste maybe if you are a teenager you may find it amusing films are made for an immature mind so teens go for it the rest no way
<START> ok before i even start the more or less <UNK> criticism of the movie i'd like to say a few words which come from the heart this movie sucks don't go to see it unless you really like <UNK> boy bands and wooden acting no plot stories so let's go to why i think the movie is so bad 1 there is not story line there is no plot the director tried to create a mystery it the feeling just wasn't there 2 the whole thing looks like a big hour and a half promotion for some kind of <UNK> wanna be but still looking like band all guys in school have perfect <UNK> no fat or ugly young people there is no good looking girl in the movie as well not one the main character is either wet in the swimming pool or all <UNK> in his bed poor guy must be awful to go on a date <UNK> like that 3 can those guys do something good with their powers anything good like put off the fire in that old <UNK> or help his friend who got into the accident instead of just running around breaking things and showing of in front of each other 4 wooden acting the main character only has two expressions on his face expression number one sad expression number two trying to look seductive but still seems sad in that boy band there are 4 guys the main his best friend who got into the accident the and the fourth one what was the name of the fourth one i think he only spoke twice throughout the whole film once in the beginning he said the jumping from the cliff using the power won't kill them and second time at the end when he and the lost the girl the movie could have been done without him and no one would notice anyways my verdict 1 is the perfect score for this film guys do not go to see it there is very little action no suspense no hot girls girls a least the actors are good looking what i would advise you people is to get a of this movie that's the only thing i liked about it
<START> why is impossible to write in french very <UNK> this journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities nevertheless current in 1976 these big of monsters is completely ridiculous the film deserve however a remake as was king kong the last one with a little more <UNK> scenario the professor has <UNK> with the professor <UNK> and is rather funny david the character is enough inconsistent but cross spend to the people from below a good message you <UNK> and will overcome you altogether we would say a film made in the 40s now that i said everything or almost the evil of which i thought of it we can say that if we have the brain get tired or anything has to see of the other one then the thing matter is even rather entertaining hugh such is my opinion <UNK> french to english with sorry for possible mistakes
<START> i love pop culture but i was a little <UNK> when i first heard about this then i seen an episode and i love it i was a little upset when i found out that christopher would no longer be playing doctor who he was probably the best one they've had he fits the character so well it's sad to see him go i really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as br br i think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures such as the the story lines and characters can more than make up for that i'm currently waiting for season two and i will review that as well in case for any reason quality goes down br br anyways i think everyone should try to see one episode i did and i have been loving it ever since well written well casted and well produced this show is worth the hour of viewing doctor who gets a 10 10
<START> anyone who watched alien vs predator must've known that the conventions of the alien were not exactly adapted for the film amongst some of the unusual elements the rapid growth of the aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes aliens with extremely long <UNK> and so on however the idea of the predator species providing the <UNK> of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that i couldn't resist br br i had hoped the end of the film would not be the <UNK> of this sequel and unfortunately i was wrong for those who forgot how the first film ended the dead predator had an alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both br br for this film i'm going to just go through a list of good and bad traits br br the good lots of gorgeous people especially the men br br the bad lots of gorgeous people get <UNK> by both the mutant predator alien and the predator br br the good an interesting idea of the predator planet br br the bad an inconsistent scale of a town its a small town without many opportunities but with a very sophisticated read big city <UNK> system and homeless is it a small town or a city the police force is one sheriff and three <UNK> or so i counted br br the good um br br the bad why do these mutant aliens <UNK> grow so fast in a matter of five minutes they seem to grow to their full size i mean c'mon what are these things <UNK> pet aliens and while we're on this subject why is it that an alien inside a body <UNK> but an alien in a <UNK> body doesn't does that make sense br br the good still thinking br br the bad why would only one predator come and why does it pour acid over all the <UNK> of the aliens but it decides to murder a cute deputy and then skin him and hang him upside down i mean so much for being <UNK> br br the good ah i'm stuck i guess there's lots of loud sounds br br the bad how do these mutated alien <UNK> <UNK> apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion they <UNK> several <UNK> into the woman's body yeah just what you'd like to see eh pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens as if the previous way wasn't gross enough i mean there isn't even an alien queen br br the good did i say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous br br the bad when a nuclear device blows apart buildings how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast and how tacky is it for one of the passengers to <UNK> <UNK> the pilot i told you not to crash i mean given the nuclear <UNK> when he wakes up in the morning he'll have no hair left br br i could go on and on but i think you get the message mutated alien predator bursts through dead body grows over the matter of a couple of minutes kills all the <UNK> and manages to get crashed on earth more mutant alien <UNK> are created while one <UNK> predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species predator kills humans mutant alien <UNK> kill humans humans kill humans sucks to be a human in this movie eh br br if you're impressed by lots of <UNK> and <UNK> you'll love this movie br br if you liked the first i suggest you skip this sequel
<START> <UNK> hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut <UNK> driver and david duchovny have that <UNK> something called chemistry sure the plot is unlikely but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film <UNK> <UNK> does a great job as <UNK> grandfather other great character actors play his card buddies jim belushi is hilarious as the down to earth husband of <UNK> part of the extended family br br faith family and marriage are respected a few sexual references and <UNK> words are used but in context and with gentle humor br br and in the background that wonderful dean martin tune return to me br br recommended
<START> everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense unfortunately very little of <UNK> makes any sense jennifer <UNK> is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man kyle <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance jim <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is very unbelievable as the <UNK> revenge seeking <UNK> when jennifer <UNK> gives back the money she has carefully been <UNK> all credibility flies out the window and the guns pointing final showdown between <UNK> and <UNK> is beyond ridiculous avoid <UNK> unless you are <UNK> enough to believe the misguided positive reviews here <UNK>
<START> the third and final female prisoner <UNK> film directed by <UNK> the <UNK> star would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge song directed by the capable who also directed in the excellent stray cat rock sex hunter the original female prisoner <UNK> <UNK> is one of my all time favorites the sequel <UNK> <UNK> is nearly as good it's generally considered the best of the series and i might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is nearly as good as it's much slower much more <UNK> it has its share of violence and <UNK> but there's more focus on the story and the characters <UNK> detectives in the first scene she is <UNK> to one and his arm off  and escapes with it in <UNK> which must be seen to be believed and <UNK> up with a <UNK> prostitute <UNK> <UNK> is being <UNK> by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofy looking <UNK> with a cage full of pet <UNK> what really surprised me is how sad the movie is story which is never resolved it heartbreaking the images are startling and direction is masterful it's too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the series this is an awesome film
<START> this movie had an interesting enough plot about <UNK> and <UNK> usage but it fails as the lead actor is so annoying and whiny you want him dead not that anyone else is very good in it either but when you hate the character that is supposed to be <UNK> your sympathy the movie just fails to work funny enough it looks like a movie is coming out in the near future that has a plot that mirrors this one with more action and a better cast still though i won't be able to think of anything else but this film if i were to watch it this movie has a super dumb clone that is somehow smart enough to figure something is wrong with his camp where people <UNK> at one mile per hour and <UNK> for no reason the <UNK> tell them that when they are ready they go to america but our hero has his doubts so he <UNK> around and learns the awful truth which sends him on the run from the bad guys who shoot and hit the guy repeatedly he goes on the look out for the man he was <UNK> from peter graves is in it and so is dick but they add nothing to this movie which looks like something that was made for television on the plus side though when the island comes out the makers of this film can proudly say we thought of it first
<START> this blake <UNK> film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy a drama or a musical no matter the sheer presence of julie andrews is reason enough to see this comedy drama musical spy spoof julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film rock hudson looks tired but he's is more than fine as <UNK> romantic interest authentic world war i cars and planes add to the appeal overall the film is very entertaining the dvd release is an edited by blake <UNK> version of the original release supposedly this is the only version that <UNK> would allow but turner classic movies has shown the complete theatrical release version recently recommended
<START> we were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here well we got it home and could not believe what we saw its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help <UNK> his sexual <UNK> and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor the main character is all over the place one moment he is like an immature little kid the next moment he is mature and intelligent then heroic then a perverted stalker br br the worst part is all of the out of place sexual content i have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy but this is just presented in a way that is creepy <UNK> slips close ups of a girls <UNK> many times in white <UNK> or a <UNK> it was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters br br we were expecting something of a mature nature but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was besides <UNK> cartoon boobs and poor dialogue if you want to see some cartoon characters <UNK> and this is for you if you are looking for something beyond that this movie was empty the characters and dialogue were just plain irritating br br
<START> this film is the one which you fall in love with alfred hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time the most influential aspects about his films are sheer simplicity gripping drama the another best thing about hitchcock's films is a definite gripping end br br any thing said about the man who knew too much is less the cinematography acting dialogs camera works are magnificent in this movie the song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the end shall remain in our memories for life time the film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends rarely would hitchcock include humor in his films this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie br br this film is absolutely brilliant as good as vertigo
<START> this picture is a bad and blown up rip off of the michael short film <UNK> from 1995 while michael idea was original and perfect for a short film setting a sound of plot was poorly adapted from story and not fit for a full length feature film one would expect from a major <UNK> studio the tragic <UNK> situation that ruined the sets in <UNK> was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain in this case for a studio to release such a product it is a shame especially for warner brothers a studio which broke new effects grounds with shows like <UNK> 5 in 1993 on television visual effects for television shows <UNK> cgi in episodic television in the mid nineties were way more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture in cases like this sad as it may be can the film
<START> this is one of the more <UNK> movies i have ever seen br br casting richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore diane looks a bit eager to please and <UNK> as usual but she seems <UNK> by the romance herself supporting cast not too memorable br br story the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting the story is weak not enough happens to make a movie about there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here br br the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive br br not destined to be a great one to remember
<START> this is my favorite movie of all time i just love all the trouble all the teams get into its great michael j fox looked so young but then again i guess he was br br the teams are so stereotypical you just have to laugh
<START> i had the funny chance of seeing this on mystery science theater 3000 four years ago i must admit it wasn't as badly done as some other science fiction horror movies of the time the plot <UNK> around an astronaut that came back to earth with alien inside of him now the plot is quite weird well if you can even call that a plot seeing a space program run out of one building and an old pickup truck is drop dead funny i'll admit it was horrible by today's standards and 20 years ago but i can see myself <UNK> years ago watching and being <UNK> by this movie it's not even close to the badness of invasion of the <UNK> men <UNK> hands of fate or future war br br
<START> imagine diane from cheers the self centered over character now imagine she was trying to make a film movie this would be it if you just looked at some of the shots without any sound you would think hmmm this could be a good film br br now if you turn on the sound and listen for anytime at all you quickly realize that the person that made the film knows nothing about films beyond what they read in a book i was continually thinking is this thing a foreign film it was that bad br br if you don't remember cheers then think of mr <UNK> holiday remember the <UNK> character that made the horrible movie well imagine that horrible movie without mr bean saving it that is what this movie is i'm not saying anything about what the movie is other than it is an attempt to make a dark moody film about a hit man going back home at least that's about all i could get out of it
<START> the video opens with a scene from a horror movie in which a man <UNK> to his girlfriend he begins to tell her that he is different as the full moon rises he <UNK> into a werewolf he then <UNK> her through the woods and right before he attacks we're taken to the inside of the movie theater inside the theater are michael and his girlfriend she's too scared to watch any longer so they leave as they exit the theater he begins to <UNK> her it's close to midnight something lurking in the dark michael then sings and dances his way down the street with his girlfriend this scene shows michael's skill with the camera he never once acts aware of its presence as many other artists do as they make there way past the graveyard the graves begin to open once they arrive at an alley they are confronted with a <UNK> of the undead we then see the horror stricken face of michael's girl who wouldn't have a horror stricken look if their date <UNK> into a zombie yep he becomes one of the undead a very bright and shiny one though he and his fellow zombies then begin what may be the most well known dance choreography of any music video to tell you any more would give the ending away br br this is my favorite music video of all time you don't want to miss it i give it a 10 10 yes i know you can see the <UNK> in the back of the sound stage and the werewolf looks kind of cheesy by today's standards
<START> the big trail 1930 released 10 24 1930 viewed 4 5 <UNK> br br <UNK> richard harris harold <UNK> robert <UNK> br br doug in hollywood <UNK> walsh <UNK> his latest film the big trail a western about the trek west across the frontier starring up and coming 23 year old actor john wayne in 1930 we are seeing many <UNK> but few <UNK> besides the first john wayne film we have here the first widescreen film although we only watched the full frame version interestingly the decision to film in widescreen was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later to compete with television which hadn't yet appeared <UNK> but was still an <UNK> curiosity all the same this film was extremely good giving us a harrowing look at the trek to <UNK> the opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind about america about the land who should live on it etc and is an excellent <UNK> of that walsh gives us some astonishing visuals of the <UNK> company out in the wilderness when they reach a cliff they must rope each <UNK> down one by one and we also get a revenge subplot involving wayne pursuing the man who killed one of his friends i seem to recall something similar in <UNK> wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partly there and would surely <UNK> further in subsequent films since this film is representing all of wayne's early 30's work for the odyssey we will not see his face again until <UNK> but once we do we will keep seeing him to the end of the odyssey and beyond br br kevin ah our first sound western and john wayne's first starring role it's <UNK> <UNK> the big trail this review will be short since it's been weeks since i watched it i enjoyed this movie but it was far from a masterpiece the mostly predictable adventure had a few surprises like when the brains of the bad guys red <UNK> <UNK> power sr in his last role is killed half way through i thought he would be the boss at the end but that ended up being bill ian keith i remember that i didn't like the way <UNK> wayne kills and <UNK> revenge at the end i understood that that's what he was meant to do in the story but i really didn't like his reasoning when he tells ruth why he has to do it i think he had a far greater responsibility to the hundreds of <UNK> he was leading through the harsh west br br last film viewed animal <UNK> 1930 last film <UNK> soup to nuts 1930 next film <UNK> <UNK> 1930
<START> <UNK> himself as writer director actor in his indie production about a big guy wandering around chicago with an eye for every woman he sees the laughs keep coming almost every minute it's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love but done with great comedic writing and acting the supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich br br rose is hysterical in her <UNK> role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film sara silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with jeff bonnie hunt is <UNK> great in her role i only wish there was more of her in the film as i think most will agree it's certainly refreshing to see her in a tight leather outfit br br david was the <UNK> detached sidekick and voice of reason <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> mother who he lives with there were numerous other cameos all of them done very well br br at the <UNK> jeff mentioned his inability to do more with bonnie due to production issues still it's good to leave you wanting more i think it's that indie thing of keeping some things ambiguous to let the audience do some thinking for themselves to fill in the <UNK> the <UNK> title should clue you in to this br br jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his past relationships this explains why they work so well real life people are always unusually colorful and makes great characters he <UNK> quite a bit from what you might expect having seen <UNK> your enthusiasm and some of his other work it's one of those break out things where an actor takes some risks to do something they maybe always wanted to do but couldn't br br i think it's noteworthy that <UNK> second city background and <UNK> for that matter set the style here of acting being the focus of the story and the directing it's perhaps a new innovative hybrid of <UNK> meets indie film making
<START> has the drama suspense and character developments you would enjoy if you like drama that <UNK> you and entertains as well as <UNK> br br the writers know their material and it shows the direction is always engaging and not <UNK> and the acting terrific why this show didn't win any awards tells me the powers that be in <UNK> don't know drama or much else for that matter br br there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out i'm glad it wasn't used as a shock scene for any climatic end to this series which would have been more typical and dull rent this series at once let's hope its brought back from celluloid <UNK>
<START> i don't have a really solid <UNK> here so i'm just going to toss out some observations br br first of all the film is absolutely gorgeous it's shot in high contrast black and white and some of the scenes are so well composed that they're almost distracting br br there's a sequence early on of some intense <UNK> and some of the shots were amazing three guys <UNK> tear gas at the <UNK> etc br br second of all i think that one of the biggest signs that this is a recent film looking back on the 60's is that it's really about how the <UNK> of the revolution <UNK> and <UNK> into something different the take on this shift is really interesting i think that both the political phase of things as well as the artistic and more self indulgent phase have strong points and weak points the film doesn't necessarily take the position that things <UNK> br br third i think the romance works very well br br finally i really really really hated the ending it was way too melodramatic you could even say that the ending is <UNK> of the film that <UNK> it
<START> look i've come to expect this level of acting from william macy the guy just keeps putting in terrific performances but meat <UNK> just when did his decide to leave jim behind and throw his decidedly lower weight around in the wonderful world of <UNK> well what can i say i'm <UNK> impressed to <UNK> an old <UNK> it ain't the meat it's the emotion and the <UNK> is quietly <UNK> up his acting chops of late br br laura dern carries off the 40's look perfectly here great job by the costume and hair <UNK> david <UNK> is <UNK> but right on the money solid camera work throughout the flick the plot line is reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> post wwii anti <UNK> well worth your time particularly for the growing <UNK> of bill macy <UNK> br br
<START> or safe journey is the second film in tony trilogy of the <UNK> people the film is a visual depiction and historical record of <UNK> life in european and middle eastern countries even though the scenes are mostly planned <UNK> and staged there is not a conventional story line and the dialog does not explain activities from scene to scene instead the film allows the viewer to have sometimes a glimpse sometimes a more in depth view of these people during different <UNK> and in different countries ranging from india egypt romania <UNK> france and spain br br the importance of music in <UNK> culture is clearly expressed throughout the film it is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication everything they do is expressed with music dance is another important activity like <UNK> music it is <UNK> and deeply personal something they alone know how to do correctly we are provided glimpses into their everyday activities but the film is not a detailed study of their lives rather it is a testament to their culture focusing on the music and dance they have created and which have made them unique br br mr portrays the <UNK> groups in a positive way however we also witness the <UNK> <UNK> and alienation they receive from the non <UNK> population it seems that the culture they have developed over countless generations and inspired from diverse countries will fade into oblivion because conventional society has no place for <UNK> ways br br the other films in the trilogy are les <UNK> 1983 and 1998
<START> a pointless cash in with nothing to contribute except <UNK> this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for <UNK> <UNK> numbing plot less and tired mess of a sequel is watchable and even mildly entertaining in a dubious <UNK> trashy way but it has virtually none of the <UNK> flair emotion intelligence or excitement instead we have just another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to the viewer with relentless violence which is far more <UNK> gratuitous than anything in the original <UNK> <UNK> products who made the original <UNK> cyborg have turned into more of a <UNK> force than ever second time round what with the suspicious nazi esquire <UNK> guards and tanks for hire at the end as for the anonymous old man daniel <UNK> <UNK> he's less of a <UNK> <UNK> and more of a hideous mr burns type surrounding himself with moronic <UNK> who genuinely believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of the all new <UNK> 2 is a good idea oh and the first <UNK> gets a look in somewhere amidst all of this mess though you wonder what on earth a fine actor like peter <UNK> saw in the script the <UNK> tom <UNK> has nothing to work with as the villain while nancy allen is badly wasted as partner there are some hilarious moments throughout the opening commercial for instance but this is a poor follow up to the truly great original
<START> rainy day with not much to do we were surfing the movie network channels and found this one just starting so we gave it a chance br br the more we watched the more we became <UNK> in the story its the old story of working class underdog trying to make it in a sport which at the time <UNK> i think was usually played by the wealthy upper class but this movie was every bit as interesting as and this is also based on a true story br br the acting is believable and the casting is brilliant and we are not <UNK> so please don't miss this one just because its about golf any individual sport would serve the plot because it's about the people golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and <UNK> that seem to involve some who play the game br br bottom line its a feel good movie it's well put together and isn't it always fun to see those who think they are better than others get taken down a <UNK> or two
<START> i haven't laughed so much in a theater in years the only problem is that it was not the intent of the movie to make my throat raw from laughter br br this movie is absolutely <UNK> with bad cgi absolutely terrible <UNK> absolutely terrible acting and enough geek references to make the whole thing come off as nothing but complete cheese br br as a <UNK> and a geek type girl myself i did recognize all of the obvious game references in this movie as well as the geek stuff that was just thrown into the background as eye candy the poster the t shirts from com and j list com and that didn't redeem the movie at all br br the only thing that might have been good at all were the ghost children type characters that were <UNK> badly done in cgi to make it look like they were from a game and who were obviously stolen from japanese horror movies br br to be honest it was hilariously bad and something i'd expect from a midnight showing of a made for tv b grade sci fi channel movie don't expect more than that and you'll have a great time just don't get a <UNK> or you'll spit it everywhere when you get great lines like why did you bring that game into our lives why
<START> i very much enjoyed bruce almighty but the minute i found out that there was going to be a sequel without jim carey i knew it was bad although steve carell was hysterical in the first film the <UNK> scene is one of my favorites and in my opinion deserves an emmy for his role in the office he is pretty weak in this dull comedy i'm curious how much work the script writers put because we could just as well do without the story but even if we <UNK> the huge plot holes why did elephants and lions come to aid <UNK> when the <UNK> only concerned that particular area of washington the film is simply not funny i did not laugh once and as far as i remember a comedy is supposed to make you laugh or giggle at least not this one br br there is small hope however <UNK> almighty has family written all over it and maybe a family viewing might be enjoyable kids might be entertained by the variety of animals and the silly jokes but for me <UNK> almighty simply doesn't cut it br br i give it a 4 10 and hope that carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in the feature
<START> this is the ultimate of horror movies this year house of wax is one of the scariest movies i've ever seen this version really puts the vincent price version of the movie to shame i only know a few of the young cast in the movie the ever <UNK> paris hilton the pain in the you know what seems to be more seductive than ever at least she didn't try to copy her <UNK> well if she likes to do horror she's better than wheel of white she beats hands down and the scene of where house of wax was made was no joke the house was made of wax and the victims were able to get out of there before the get <UNK> like their friends those two twins bo and vincent the <UNK> twins were <UNK> from the get go the parents raised them well except for vincent and i think they became equally <UNK> how come the the one in the other pick up happen to be creepy but not as bad as the other two that's another story in the book i guess he had to follow his heart and not the other twins who turned <UNK> into a tourist trap for unsuspecting victims this movie is like the phantom of the opera meets the rocky horror picture show and this movie is one of the scariest one in 2005 rating 4 out of 5 stars
<START> i tried to like this movie i love kevin spacey and i knew the other guy from his role as big brain on brad in pulp fiction but i just didn't care about the characters at all kevin spacey is a <UNK> through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him i didn't like him especially the ending that made me hate him even more this was like watching a bad car wreck spacey played a <UNK> well he does it all well but other than that i don't recommend it
<START> in this film gary <UNK> plays a defense attorney who was <UNK> a <UNK> he is a bit tormented but is more or less playing a regular guy rather than some sort of <UNK> or literal monster funny thing is he doesn't quite pull it off i guess you can't quite get to normal from there kevin bacon was <UNK> creepy the scene in the park was way too long with way too many false scares and the odd sex scene with <UNK> and karen young seemed to have come from a different movie although the rest of the time miss young did just fine this film suffers from <UNK> trying to cover up the predictability and failing don't bother
<START> i agree with the user that this episode is awful <UNK> worst of the entire show now i'm not keen on many episodes of the later series but this one takes the <UNK> it was unfunny and as for the ending i'm sorry but it disgusted me more than any other episodes combined br br i mean the boys think they meant well but the ending was so <UNK> that they think the whale belongs on the moon and over the credits we see it has died could have saved the episode was if the <UNK> were able to confess for what they did br br there seem to be no <UNK> message okay south park may be guilty of preaching too much and its always nice to see an one such as make love not but this episode was just wrong avoid at all costs helen
<START> this is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on tv i own all 9 seasons on dvd and literally could watch them over and over anyone who does not find this show hilarious heartwarming entertaining and laugh out loud hysterical is crazy kevin james is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there my boyfriend and i love going to stand up comedy shows in boston where we live and have seen kevin james twice and his brother gary valentine danny once they are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work there are so many comedians out there that are just awful and kevin and gary really show the true side of real comedy <UNK> although a <UNK> and bitch in real life so i have read is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms she truly makes the show along with jerry stiller this show is a must see and you will get addicted within one to two episodes
<START> one has to take martin lewis like a dash of salt pepper why does martin put up with lewis then again why do all the women in this movie like jerry because he is <UNK> likeable martin sings a few good songs lip at least once and jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other movies combined i generally find that i can take just so much of <UNK> antics before they become <UNK> but in this film watch when jerry gets stuck outside on a <UNK> navy submarine excellent buster keaton should have been proud i give the film a 7
<START> <UNK> arrives in a strange <UNK> place where everything seems perfect he's given a good work everyone is kind to him and to everyone and he really doesn't trouble too much even in finding a beautiful girlfriend but in this no named city <UNK> finds soon that a perfect commercials type world is really not a paradise really one of the better movies i've seen this year the attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction where every single <UNK> cool <UNK> photography cold <UNK> design <UNK> acting slow highly controlled camera movements helps in building an unique weird atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the end a sarcastic ironic bitter comedy that made me laugh <UNK> think as only best films are able to do nothing new probably in the analysis of the modern de civilization but really a smart work with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten from whom had the luck to see it simply beautiful the amazing scene in the <UNK> underground
<START> i really liked this quirky movie the characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on tv it has a realistic edge with a captivating story line the main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch
<START> i was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater br br we have all seen this plot line before top gun <UNK> jane an officer and a gentleman but a good script still works this story is basically about the training of a coast guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines kevin <UNK> plays a highly successful rescue team leader ben randall who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission the movie takes us through the <UNK> of the training process and the personal stories of both the <UNK> character and that of jake <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> i am happy to say that <UNK> is great in this part br br there are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives however the use of humor the exploration of the <UNK> of the training and the fun of watching ben randall do his own thing as a <UNK> kept me <UNK> and thoroughly entertained i really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud gasp here and there and <UNK> at the end as a tribute to the movie br br we all had a good time despite a couple of tough moments in the movie and i think you will too
<START> this is one of the most laughably bad films i've ever seen i cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious perhaps he was connected with making it it doesn't have anything going for it there is no suspense the acting is dire the direction hopeless the music score is three trite notes played ad <UNK> the plot must have taken all of five minutes to write the dialogue is what a 10 year old would come up with if asked to do a <UNK> project the only slightly redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself who <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and thus is amusing at times the only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak <UNK> don't waste your time
<START> this film is so lovingly made you want to be part of it forever the <UNK> are straight but not without <UNK> the goods are transparent and <UNK> are hardly there even the <UNK> are so naive they'll make you <UNK> with nostalgia in comparison to anything available on tv <UNK> is fine if a bit one sided louis <UNK> is perfect you just can't have a better <UNK> he has the best line my dad <UNK> other people's dirt and i do the same is unbearable but i guess in part it's the songs wardrobe and <UNK> <UNK> on the contrary makes a great femme fatale if a bit silent i didn't realize she may be a lesbian as imdb user and others rightly suggest
<START> i thought that the love letter was a pretty good movie there were certain things that could have made it better but kate <UNK> is absolutely beautiful and she showed it in this movie i wish that there could have been a few more revealing scenes of her but it was still a very good movie it was very fun to watch
<START> this is simply a good <UNK> fashioned western not overly complex or long it doesn't <UNK> itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment still it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning it features former partners randolph scott and glenn ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that ford's <UNK> rogers has been part of bank robbing he even steals scott's sheriff steve horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is <UNK> in red valley is under heavy <UNK> for a bank robbing that ended with several dead claire portrays <UNK> a friend of who gives he and buddy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> williams a place to stay for the time being <UNK> desires to go straight but finds that hard when jack lester bernard and his bad bunch want to rob red bank it is actually jack who is behind the murders but troubled past is hard to get away from he and <UNK> will be charged with the murders they didn't commit the robbery was one <UNK> didn't commit and it will be who must somehow save the day before lester gets away with murder there are sub plots which include falling in love with alison <UNK> evelyn <UNK> the irony of the story is that <UNK> father uncle willie is actually in <UNK> with <UNK> stanley porter hall in a planned united <UNK> with lester to steal the town of red <UNK> will <UNK> uncle willie and <UNK> <UNK> scheme will uncle willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him this film has a terrific <UNK> <UNK> and a dandy of a climactic shootout columbia couldn't have picked a better genre to begin the <UNK> process as this film has some fine <UNK> shots as men give chase on <UNK> and such don't expect to get your <UNK> blown off but the film is simple and well paced
<START> i can't emphasize it enough do not get this movie for the kids br br for that matter you'd best spare the adults from it as well br br all right perhaps i'm a little this isn't the worst kids' movie no let me <UNK> that this isn't the worst movie made by adults for adults and somehow <UNK> towards kids that would be jack which i've been meaning to review gut like a fish br br adults won't learn anything surprising well if you must fast forward to just before the end credits for a educational bit about an interesting <UNK> we don't usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way well duh i could have told you that so can four years of college at an art school but i br br i have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie most likely it will only upset them we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old there's a better movie <UNK> delivery service that has essentially the same message but handles it instead of <UNK> it into your head and the adults will like it too br br by the way there is a moment in the movie made with <UNK> mst3k <UNK> in mind if they think of that other bruce willis movie with a sad little kid in it
<START> after seeing this movie i have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket <UNK> ninja action and white hot sexual <UNK> that is ninja iii the <UNK> br br we all know that sho <UNK> rocks that is a given but how about jordan <UNK> ultra macho interpretation of his character police officer billy bravo mr bennett bravo you prove early on while trying to seduce the <UNK> christie played to perfection by one miss <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> fame that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft i particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as 4 thugs try to rape her outside her gym oh you could have helped sure but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss will wear the pants in this relationship i also enjoyed how mr bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the wife <UNK> tank top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back back and shoulder hair are hot and knows it and how about <UNK> <UNK> all i can say is i see a sex bomb getting ready to explode she's got all the right moves as both a <UNK> and a martial arts <UNK> the chemistry behind <UNK> and bennett is what makes this movie <UNK> you'd think she would hate him because he's kind of a cheesy jerk but no my friends the animal <UNK> is too strong to resist and they bond like crazy <UNK> sho <UNK> is not as prominent as you might think though still a main character which is fine by me because all i wanted was more bennett and <UNK> he does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see the special effects wow that is all i can say i will not give away the ending but let's just say it will not disappoint i love ninja iii the <UNK> and can only hope that there is a ninja 4 i give it a 5 out of 5 throwing stars disappoint
<START> released in english under many titles and the <UNK> of them certainly is the eerie midnight horror show is one of the best italian rip offs of the exorcist to really appreciate this film you should have a sense of humor is at the same time sleazy but naive pathetic and sometimes even moving br br stella an art student goes to an old church to see the statue she's going to <UNK> it's a wooden statue of christ a demonic christ maybe already overcome by evil or fighting against it or perhaps planning dark deeds the face shows <UNK> torment the statue dates from the <UNK> century is impressed by the <UNK> shown by the <UNK> the statue seems almost alive she lives with her parents her mother love lives a <UNK> life and doesn't care too much for keeping up appearances her father mario chris <UNK> everything with <UNK> eyes br br the wooden statue will soon assume a human form <UNK> <UNK> and possess in the <UNK> and spiritual sense an amazing scene the poor from now on will suffer the <UNK> of hell br br the lovely stella was <UNK> <UNK> possessed by the devil and now following his orders she will try to seduce others ain't she <UNK> her sleazy mother love who feels great pleasure when her lover <UNK> her with a bunch of <UNK> there is a scene so ridiculous as to be sublime and moving when stella runs in despair through the narrow streets possessed by the devil remember of a small italian town screaming her heart out <UNK> <UNK> is a very good exorcist his performance is as usual intense the <UNK> scenes the final battle are very very amateurish but this will only enhance the fun and or emotion if you've really got a sense of humor br br stella is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent and that's a factor that adds to your pleasure when she's naked but i think that the film could have explored more her natural beauty love is a very good sleaze companion her nude scene with the <UNK> well br br other italian exorcist rip offs i would like to recommend for you are br br very sleazy and released uncut and <UNK> restored br br evil eye the exorcist was the main source of inspiration for evil eye but others films like for instance rosemary's baby should also be taken into account evil eye is completely over the top not that sleazy but with plenty of gorgeous italian and spanish actresses you'll be <UNK> all over the film the film is ridiculous the story doesn't make any sense but if you see it in the right mood you might feel moved a diabolical <UNK> possession murders despair love investigation and beautiful women all around a wild ride br br if you liked evil eye see also ring of darkness this film can be found in the alternative market search this title in the imdb there are good reviews about it br br p s has many different faces it's exploitative but it can also be serious and moving it's cheap cheesy sleazy but not that much and it has an underlying moral message this strange <UNK> can sometimes be very funny we all already know that is an exorcist rip off so why can't we see it on its own terms yes mario <UNK> was trying to earn a fast buck but he was able get the most out of a <UNK> budget the story is well told the film is atmospheric and overall the actors are committed to their roles see the film with an open mind and you may discover two or three new things
<START> this film works on a lot of different levels it's a profile of one very cool couple a social commentary on aging and <UNK> homes a love story a musical i've seen uncle frank a few times and every time i watch it i'm not sure who to go call first my parents my wife a friend i've lost touch with but it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life and want to <UNK> the ones that continue expect a lot of laughs and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a <UNK> i'm pretty sure they will
<START> i saw this in the theatre a couple decades ago and fuzzy <UNK> suggests that i liked it however seeing it for a second time two things stand out 1 very poor acting on the part of michelle johnson and 2 very poor music throughout br br it's not that all the music was bad some of the brazilian music was fine but the theme song and others that their way in were reminiscent of the worst of '80s pop music br br <UNK> voice seemed all wrong possibly dubbed this was distracting br br on the positive side 1 the story's not bad 2 it's interesting seeing such a young <UNK> moore 3 valerie <UNK> never looked better and 4 johnson did look quite <UNK> in various stages of
<START> <UNK> is another classic aussie film as so many australian films like the castle the dish and sunday too far away it goes somewhere that hasn't been widely explored in film before this time it is the game of lawn <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a much slower paced sports movie than many you will find such as remember the <UNK> or million dollar the characters involved are <UNK> in their own right this movie is a show case of a large area of australian culture and features a sport that is popular and on the rise of popularity in australia mick presents a classic unforgettable character it really is a must see
<START> this was essentially a remake of <UNK> murder minus victoria <UNK> scott <UNK> charlie <UNK> dick is playing a college professor who teaches <UNK> 101 and can't even find his own <UNK> barry is now a private eye not related to dick this lets barry shoot at guys <UNK> away from him which a cop can not do barry still gets the girl in the end <UNK> <UNK> portrays the girl she is the prime suspect and dick and barry believe she's innocent and prove it that's all the spoiler you get the ending is <UNK> unexpected that you don't already know it half way through the movie br br don't take it seriously don't critique it just sit back and enjoy dick and barry van dyke
<START> in terms of historical accuracy this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen the list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three hour film but just to give you an idea br br <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are presented as liberal <UNK> taking the side of the people against the <UNK> this is <UNK> absurd the <UNK> were as noble as you could get their interest was in power and a country that had been <UNK> by 150 years of civil war there had been <UNK> notably the brothers who lived about 100 years earlier and to some extent <UNK> for the rights of ordinary citizens br br there are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous if you know anything about the period <UNK> with richard burton will give you a much better idea of how events <UNK> <UNK> though it is br br historical accuracy is one thing acting and dialogue are something else and here this film <UNK> <UNK> close to being a bad junior high school production i burst out laughing several times especially when julia the daughter of <UNK> meets a lover they <UNK> <UNK> as she <UNK> my father ah your father your father your father would <UNK> peter o'toole is at his worst forced to <UNK> his way through some very pompous and silly lines the actor who plays <UNK> as a young man is such a <UNK> and the character is written as such it's impossible to <UNK> him as the cunning <UNK> <UNK> politician who created the roman empire here he's just a <UNK> who has to be told what to do most of the time br br charlotte <UNK> does manage to emerge from an <UNK> role as <UNK> wife with dignity had she been given a fuller role to play she might have rescued this production from absurdity br br there is some nice photography and battle footage helped by plenty of standard issue cgi oddly this was made for british tv and appears to be a british italian co production but is labeled with an r rating br br the dvd picture is excellent and the <UNK> digital soundtrack is very nice although you only notice it during the few action sequences as the movie is mostly talk br br almost any roman movie even <UNK> or the fall of the roman empire has more <UNK> to say nothing of compelling drama than this bizarre classics illustrated jr adaptation this one gives new meaning to the much abused phrase based on a true story in this case they could have said suggested by real events
<START> i can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and specially the ones in which the subtitles are weak and don't really seems to follow the story or really make sense but this movie had too many parts that didn't really make sense br br all in all i can admit to a few scary and freaky parts but they are repetitive i felt like i was watching a loop trailer seems like it was a short film shot with different actors br br in the <UNK> of <UNK> and grudge but not even close the the hype the excessive length killed the thrill br br unless you are a die hard fan of these types of movies <UNK> i thought i was don't waste your time on this one
<START> sometimes hallmark can get it right like the <UNK> kingdom but many of their fantasy films <UNK> and this falls into the latter category the version i saw may have been cut a demon shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a <UNK> br br possible spoilers if you are unfamiliar with the original fairy tale br br anyway the film <UNK> the story to the early part of the 20th century and makes <UNK> and kay here called <UNK> being a fan i kept expecting him to say the dead do not solve 18 year olds hans christian <UNK> basic story is followed the boy gets a <UNK> of ice in his eye goes bad is taken off by the snow queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and <UNK> goes to find him having various adventures on the way br br as the two main characters are older than in the original a lot of time is spent getting them together and in <UNK> unfortunately i was never convinced that they were particularly in love and certainly not enough in love to make sense of quest by the time the main plot kicks in the movie's pace has <UNK> to a crawl alas when <UNK> begins her search for <UNK> it only manages to pick up the pace to a <UNK> <UNK> br br there are a few odd <UNK> to the story that seem to go nowhere at the start of the film the snow queen kills mother but no explanation for this is given a polar bear living in the snow <UNK> palace is more than he seems though this is possibly because the producers realised that the <UNK> feelings towards the snow queen would be ok in a fairy tale but not in a modern film again this is never explained also hints that the snow queen has an erotic desire for <UNK> are dropped but never followed through the script is also full of <UNK> that really jar you out of the fairy <UNK> mood br br the production looks good though there is evidence of penny <UNK> the snow <UNK> palace is the hotel where <UNK> and <UNK> lived covered in ice the three main characters are played with varying degrees of success <UNK> comes across as bland as does <UNK> initially but once she sets off to find <UNK> you warm to her bridget fonda looks great as the snow queen but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else br br ultimately the film is unsatisfying it looks good but drags and lacks magic
<START> first of all i want to say ang lee did a very good job on this one i watched it yesterday and i was <UNK> surprised the story is very good but all the ignorant people would say this sucks people cant fly to them i say it's fiction and that it is this is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a fairytale and a very pleasant to watch asian fairytale the can actually blow your mind because there so artistically filmed ang lee has a very u might say big talent the fight <UNK> are very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer but it's sad but this film didn't get the appreciation it should have gotten but ang lee did fortunately get the attention he deserved with his blockbuster broke back mountain so even for viewers who are not interested in the story the images are entertaining enough
<START> throughout the 1950s and into the 60s 70s and even into the 80s a slew of war films were produced in the former <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK>  civilians who turned out to fight a <UNK> war against the <UNK> german forces who's generally only known in eastern europe directed quite a few of these <UNK> stories unfortunately only a handful of them were ever <UNK> to the rest of the europe and the united states battle of the <UNK> is a rare low budget look at the <UNK> and exploits of the <UNK> air force br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that a <UNK> air force must be formed to combat the german <UNK> in the <UNK> over <UNK> a group of former pilots join forces with two small and begin <UNK> enemy <UNK> and <UNK> over the course of several months more pilots and planes join the ranks eventually <UNK> a <UNK> air force maybe it's history or maybe it's fable  whatever it is it sure isn't convincing but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work br br the film opens strongly with a well shot german air raid on <UNK> <UNK> the nuts and <UNK> of the plot come together almost immediately and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes then the action starts and this title quickly becomes yet another low budget by the numbers adventure all of the characters are familiar clichés major played by a well meaning <UNK> <UNK> is our typical patriotic heroic leading man he <UNK> away at <UNK> planes with a machine gun and even has an <UNK> duel with the villainous a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome the rest of the <UNK> are familiar the battle of is a a <UNK> playboy hell river is <UNK> a veteran <UNK> who comes out of the <UNK> now that his country needs him and the day that <UNK> the world is a young <UNK> boy who moves up through the ranks eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot the characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan and doesn't try to build upon these stereotypes the cast does a fair job and despite the two dimensional script every player is engaging and fun to watch in particular has some great moments  when he's going to take his first flight as a <UNK> and later when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed the plot merely consists of a string of air <UNK> against the germans and subsequent acts br br handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and <UNK> effects unfortunately the <UNK> are so cheap and false looking that the transitions between actual <UNK> photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable some of the <UNK> and bombing scenes look shockingly real while <UNK> involving scale models complete with action figure pilots are just plain pathetic sometimes smoke <UNK> from the machine guns are so big that the smoke <UNK> the entire model plane worse the <UNK> often <UNK> shots of fighters over real footage although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective they're surrounded by a distracting glow which <UNK> any attempt at realism all of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by br br battle of the <UNK> also suffers from a very poorly edited english language release to begin with 28 minutes of footage is missing  cutting the film from <UNK> minutes to a mere <UNK> the missing segments were <UNK> <UNK> and the cutting looks very sloppy music <UNK> are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved in the last third of the film the story falls apart and only some badly needed action scenes can try to save it from total <UNK> then there's the all of the scenes revolving around the <UNK> are dubbed in english rather poorly however yet several lengthy scenes remain in german without the benefit of subtitles the film might have made much more sense had the german language sequences been <UNK> instead of crucial scenes revolving around the <UNK> br br on the plus side handles the <UNK> footage quite well there is never a moment where the audience feels like they're on a <UNK> in particular the german <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> complete with dozens of <UNK> fighter planes and extras <UNK> in leather flying <UNK> the scenery is fresh and green and isn't afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek a german <UNK> of a <UNK> unit early on in the picture stands out as does a sequence where and escape from an enemy base br br as it exists on home video battle of the <UNK> is just another of many stories about the <UNK> <UNK> movement there is nothing to set it apart from the rest of the crop and the terrible special effects and <UNK> editing put it a notch below acceptable try to avoid this one unless you can find a full length copy
<START> in search of the <UNK> so bad it's good movie i've repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films only to be left disappointed and bored at the end not this time my eyes <UNK> up my belly and my <UNK> <UNK> from laughing so hard throughout the movie sure hulk hogan is a <UNK> actor and the plot is utterly predictable but everyone <UNK> into this movie knowing all this all anyone wants to see when renting this is hogan breaking out a can of with a bunch of yeah brother s and s flying from his <UNK> mouth and while the on the screen <UNK> a bit in comparison to the in the ring <UNK> of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this gem of a flick a laugh riot
<START> gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever <UNK> it is by far the movie of all movies the romance between scarlett and <UNK> made people dream all over the world and turned the lead actors into cinematographic icons one can ask is it really necessary to make a sequel and there are some big shoes to fill br br well there was the book first by alexandra <UNK> is we have to admit well written and fully <UNK> the world created by margaret mitchell she picks up exactly where we left our heroine previously and gently leads us from <UNK> <UNK> into her own fantasy in the book scarlett defeated after <UNK> death and leaving travels to <UNK> to <UNK> with her mother in law in hope of <UNK> love her typical manipulative behavior evokes once again a lot of criticism from <UNK> and drives them further apart until a certain boat trip that will change everything scarlett now carries a secret the series follows the book quite accurately until the arrival of scarlett in ireland from then of book and series slowly split ways the actual end <UNK> but of course the both have scarlett and <UNK> back together br br the production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next scarlett o'hara many countries made their own television shows featuring young actresses <UNK> for the part eventually about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen <UNK> and interviews in <UNK> georgia unfortunately the producer found no scarlett amongst these actresses sad for the girls major publicity for the show it was already sold to many television stations worldwide before shooting even had started robert the producer who bought the rights to told he discovered the right actress while watching tv gave her a call and two days later signed the deal <UNK> <UNK> kilmer who starred and the latest being the movie robert was watching that faithful evening is not <UNK> leigh but she certainly is scarlett her performance is not a copy of <UNK> she makes the character her own the major difference between <UNK> and is the fact the lead character <UNK> and grows as a person this is the series why <UNK> something that has been done before considering there is a gap of almost <UNK> years between the first and second storyline it is natural that both authors emphasize on different aspects of the characters whereas mitchell works around scarlett dealing with the consequences of the civil war and fighting for tara <UNK> lets scarlett face her demons this to me is the most interesting aspect of the series we get to know scarlett in a different way as she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants i totally agree with the choice of timothy dalton as <UNK> butler he portrays him with charm and irony and is less of a cardboard figure than clark <UNK> performance the rest of the cast was well chosen julie harris is endearing as mother john gielgud gives a very amusing performance as grandfather and sean bean is always at his best playing a dirty character his lord <UNK> makes no exception poor choices however with stephen collins as ashley and ann adaption of belle <UNK> was a waste of money costumes sets and locations are elaborate and convincing the newly built tara set looked exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house appears for the first time br br is there a point in making a sequel well six hours of romance are to me one to watch
<START> <UNK> pictures classics i'm looking at you <UNK> got the rights to harry records you need to <UNK> the film and you'll get <UNK> <UNK> sales of his back <UNK> anyhow this is a great study of a fascinating musician woefully full of great stories greater music and it could have been 3 hours longer and i'd have loved it even more saw it at the american <UNK> <UNK> festival at the <UNK> theatre in santa monica where it played to a packed house they were turning people away at the door i went to many of the <UNK> <UNK> festival films and let me assure you that no other film came even close to selling out let alone turning people away see it in the theatre buy the dvd and make sure some slow on the <UNK> company <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> picks it up <UNK>
<START> <UNK> may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best it is a pivotal film in the black exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it it wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that but it was the story of one bad <UNK> dude fighting <UNK> with his army of hot kung fu <UNK> it was a guilty pleasure great fun and best to watch it with friends 10 out of 10
<START> before i start to tear apart this movie mark you i love the scarlet <UNK> that story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written the movie staring jane grey is very good and the musical on broadway is the <UNK> thing there so i thought when i heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a bbc film br br to my surprise it was a weak totally stupid story that utterly failed in capturing the gorgeous tale br br there were no exciting escapes with daring <UNK> there was no deep love that made your heart <UNK> as <UNK> left the room and <UNK> <UNK> as her husband was leaving her again br br all it had was a confusing plot and a lot of out of the blue sex and violence br br sink me what a horrible movie br br
<START> this is a great premise for a movie the overall plot is very original interesting and something to think about however poor production an obviously small budget acting from the main character and several side actors really detract from this would be classic an up and coming producer should try to this story and give this <UNK> half hearted <UNK> a proper release
<START> but i can't say how i really feel about this pile of steaming dung where to begin the film quality there isn't any i've seen <UNK> pictures on america's funniest home videos the acting is <UNK> the gore effects is okay the clown mask is the best part of this movie the story is repetitive the same thing over and over again at least in a friday the 13th or halloween we stick with one main character for the most part there is no main characters just victims man now we come to the worst part of all the final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends then when the police finally arrive they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room what kind of ending do you call that crap that's what in my opinion there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie that was just sloppy writing the excuse it has to ending badly it's a horror movie or we need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel are just lame excuses and that is all i must give the camp blood the <UNK> turkey
<START> i was in my mid teens when i saw this movie and i was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the loving cinematography and the simple <UNK> of the story it <UNK> me to learn that has recently died that bury apparently has not worked in the film business for almost 30 years and that both would be in their 50s br br the <UNK> john soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and supports the air of <UNK> innocence the characters experience in <UNK> i have seen the movie poster billing it as <UNK> <UNK> which apparently means something like two children who like each other the english language <UNK> were wise to the title br br paul the ignored 15 year old son of an english businessman living in paris meets michelle an orphan at the <UNK> the two take what they intend as a day long holiday to <UNK> late father's rural <UNK> but end up staying there for a year isolated from the outside world they fall in love michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home after the <UNK> birth the police come to paul's work place and take him away br br blue <UNK> comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of innocence <UNK> in an isolated paradise so sad that friends has never been released on dvd
<START> i tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the <UNK> of censorship and express what they really want to express eric character of barry is like howard stern but much more intelligent the character itself is very fascinating as an oliver stone film i guess i was expecting more the film <UNK> a bit during the third act plus it's pretty obvious that talk radio is based on a play with its long dialogue scenes but overall the film works <UNK> is great in the lead and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him if you want to check out one of <UNK> greater films i better suggest you check out <UNK> or <UNK> this is not his best work but a good movie nonetheless
<START> genius or utter madness that depends on your interpretation of this film i <UNK> to it on the level of a self aware cop movie parody and i sincerely hope that was the intention as i don't see anyone taking it seriously d paul rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things is this film supposed to mark a departure for rudd from his core background in the comedy genre some kind of insane attempt to <UNK> him as a hard boiled action star i think not br br with the cheesy almost awkward acting low budget fx and zany over the top action set pieces it all kinda <UNK> that old tv show <UNK> hammer for me hilarious br br of course i may have totally interpreted the film wrong if it was in fact an attempt at a <UNK> action movie then it was certainly an amusing failure br br watch with lots of alcohol and some mates
<START> <UNK> is an odd little film the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic <UNK> <UNK> style horror movies with the shock factor of the then exploding '80s slasher genre it isn't totally successful mostly due to very obvious <UNK> <UNK> and the less than professional caliber of its cast of young actors but it still has its moments mostly due to the classy performance than the movie deserves by the late german actor <UNK> <UNK> who plays an aging old time horror movie star ala vincent price named conrad at the beginning of the movie we meet the has been horror star as he's shooting a commercial for <UNK> and we quickly learn that ol' conrad is a bit of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> donna jerk off just when you think he couldn't be any more un likable the commercial director <UNK> conrad for blowing a take for the <UNK> time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death nice huh conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die still <UNK> even at <UNK> door he manages to do away with a <UNK> business associate by <UNK> him with a <UNK> before he finally kicks the bucket himself conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech <UNK> tomb with video screens above the <UNK> which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for <UNK> who enter to pay their respects br br it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay <UNK> grave an after hours visit breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party not exactly my idea of fun but hey these are characters in an '80s horror film logic has no place here the college kids spend the evening having dinner with <UNK> body <UNK> in a place of honor posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning in the meantime mrs <UNK> over the <UNK> of her husband's body has called in a psychic friend to try and reach conrad through a you can pretty much figure out the rest from here since conrad wasn't a very nice guy in life it's not much of a stretch to assume that he won't be any <UNK> in death psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re <UNK> in predictably <UNK> off fashion then spends the rest of the movie <UNK> around the corridors of the <UNK> ridiculously huge house picking off the young grave robbers one by one this is where the movie falls apart endless scenes of teens wandering around empty <UNK> saying hello is anyone there are <UNK> with occasional bursts of violence we do get a pretty <UNK> <UNK> scene which is the highlight of the movie before the last two survivors finally figure out way later than any semi intelligent people would have figured out the same thing but again we're in an '80s horror film that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get <UNK> body back to its crypt where it belongs the <UNK> pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music thunder <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> etc that becomes severely annoying after a while br br i can't really recommend to anyone who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the '80s modern horror fans will <UNK> find incredibly slow moving and goofy if you came of age in that magical decade however you may get a blast of nostalgia from fans of jeffrey re animator combs may also want to check it out as the future dr west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students br br i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the label paired with roy <UNK> vault of horror and sold at dollar stores because the print quality is terrible i'm told the film has gotten a <UNK> release via the fine folks at troma which seems appropriate if you're a troma kind of person then will be right up your alley
<START> scientists at a remote lab experiment on insert creature here and create out of control monsters in the meantime a crack military team the <UNK> daughter bank robbers find their way to the remote place and are <UNK> by the giant <UNK> one by one they're eaten all during an exciting race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters the sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the sci fi channel i have to wonder just what is going on sure i like <UNK> and hollywood hunk <UNK> be eaten by cgi <UNK> as much as the next person but where's the plot or originality granted there are times when sci fi channel shines battlestar galactica if a bit dark can be very good writers have continued to <UNK> life into the various stargate offerings and the latest bbc <UNK> of doctor who is surprisingly good br br even in the various giant animal movies on sci fi the animation seems to be getting better all the time compare the in this film to the rather clunky version in the first giant film on sci fi br br but goodness how about a different plot maybe some different giant <UNK> on a <UNK> i started searching around the internet among the <UNK> i found a few interesting stories which might appeal to sf fans and out of work russian cgi animators at once i offer http www com archive <UNK> day to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the story rights the story contains violent images generally on a par with those of various sci fi channel offerings br br the story has subplot <UNK> and moral comment on the nature of humanity and ends not on one of those horrible did they really kill all the monsters moments but rather leaves you guessing completely and in an entirely different mindset br br which is generally what science fiction is supposed to do no
<START> this movie includes 2 well known actors i have previously enjoyed watching there actions are great and each action is heart felt but it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act <UNK> and <UNK> to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind <UNK> to drive the audience into tears for her release br br the only good part is the acting abilities the plot has the same <UNK> as <UNK> influence and i started to hate the protagonist for that but all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it br br
<START> seriously i'm amazed at all the good <UNK> this show has here all we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do occasional funny things only in like 2 of the shows while most of the others sucked as then they comment on music videos which i cannot stand personally while they either love or like br br in most episodes the only things you will hear are the let's go score with some chicks or i'll kick your ass <UNK> or the better yet and usually used quote that was cool and above all their annoying laugh br br if you want a good animated show try the simpsons <UNK> and <UNK> south park this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful mtv series <UNK>
<START> this disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title based on a novel by japan is located right alongside the pacific ring of fire active <UNK> and also along the edges of plate whose shifting will cause <UNK> and a japanese term in itself for <UNK> wave naturally this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture what with hollywood having a field day with films like <UNK> deep impact and more recently the day after tomorrow which <UNK> how global warming becomes the <UNK> for natural disasters gone <UNK> around the world br br but i'll have to say this the sinking of japan makes all the films mentioned earlier look like classics this disaster movie is a disaster and a massive one at that having to look at my watch every 10 15 minutes is a <UNK> that the movie doesn't engage and feels than it had over <UNK> its runtime br br the special effects are gorgeous to look at from satellite <UNK> outer space pictures to the vivid recreation of every <UNK> natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun the effects are the star of the show however having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie <UNK> as too much of a good thing just plain <UNK> br br if you had seen the trailer where you're <UNK> by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem then yes in fact those scenes are just that there are no details and everything is seen from <UNK> in a god like mode things happen just like that on screen with <UNK> an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close it's akin to godzilla knocking over buildings and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act morbid as it might sound show us the victims a <UNK> nation like japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low <UNK> count not when the filmmakers <UNK> mayhem in such an epic scale br br trying to <UNK> a romance into the movie it stood out like a sore thumb there are many characters in the movie but each one of them lacking real characteristics or humanity and look like wandering zombies without expression without emotion and definitely very stiff and unconvincing heroes become stuck in generic control rooms <UNK> statements <UNK> and form <UNK> and react to incidents like it was a computer game all settled with a push of a button these are characters that you don't give a hoot about br br if i may just use the day after tomorrow as a comparison while there are terrific effects there is at least an attempt to provide a <UNK> view of the entire disaster from different <UNK> point of views and <UNK> within are plenty of action sequences big ones like the disasters themselves and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit that makes it relatively compelling br br unfortunately for the sinking of japan this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank and hopefully <UNK> a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff
<START> <UNK> morgana the 1971 documentary like film by german filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> filmed over several years in the late 1960s is one of those rare dvds that should be listened to with the commentary turned on it is a visual feast of north african mostly <UNK> imagery that is timeless you simply could not tell that it was made over thirty five years ago the soundtrack to the film including german classical music <UNK> and and rock music by blind faith and leonard cohen also lends its timeless quality the narration by three different german <UNK> german film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> des and <UNK> von <UNK> is solid and <UNK> goes on and on of <UNK> <UNK> to this project himself and film history but the english <UNK> of the translation james william has a voice that seems downright which lends itself far more perfectly to this project even though much of the text in either language is rather superfluous yes the faux biblical sounds of the <UNK> creation myth in the film's first part creation is interesting but the text <UNK> wrote for the remaining two parts paradise and the golden age along with quotes from a german poet <UNK> names as <UNK> almost seems a satire of the first <UNK> somber the film it seems was <UNK> together during the shooting of several other <UNK> projects <UNK> the <UNK> even <UNK> started small and the documentaries the land of silence and darkness and the flying doctors of east africa but these rejected material only add to the beauty of this film such as <UNK> scenes of a <UNK> <UNK> lake from <UNK> that give one an eerie <UNK> sense one which <UNK> <UNK> about in his commentary this <UNK> feel is present right from the film's start of several <UNK> landing on a desert <UNK> with their images getting as the heat from the ground rises and <UNK> the <UNK> waves that <UNK> the images that this film was influential in the films of <UNK> is an understatement but whereas is content to just toss images at you <UNK> has an ability that only american filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> also has to make a wholly self contained <UNK> out of the <UNK> of images and words and one <UNK> upon an emotion first thrust analysis can fail when brought to such <UNK> <UNK> often does not understand even why his art is great the best he does often is wholly unconscious and <UNK> this is why his contempt for the lowest common <UNK> <UNK> of hollywood is openly stated on the commentary br br perhaps the best <UNK> of this comes in a scene that on the commentary <UNK> tells us followed a severe <UNK> in <UNK> it shows the <UNK> of cattle and <UNK> describes the unbearable <UNK> yet the viewer can sense this all from the images the <UNK> of the sun <UNK> portions of animals and the bones yet even in that commentary <UNK> focuses on the <UNK> not any deeper meaning he is content to let you <UNK> and interpret what you will into and of his work such as the almost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of sand <UNK> which recalls a scene from <UNK> <UNK> hour of the wolf where max von <UNK> runs his hand over ingrid beautiful nude <UNK> <UNK> but the <UNK> image in this film which <UNK> much of <UNK> career is of a <UNK> of a <UNK> car driving back and forth on the surface of what appears to be a lake it is deep hypnotic <UNK> <UNK> supernatural yet real just as <UNK> the believer who came from a family of <UNK> <UNK> is but then like everything else it ends
<START> this movie is a gem an <UNK> <UNK> anderson classic br br the origins of both <UNK> and space 1999 are obvious from this movie including the cast list which includes the late ed bishop and george <UNK> who both went onto <UNK> br br it is unfortunate that anderson despite his many tv <UNK> did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen just think what he could have done with the movie version of thunderbirds which he quite rightly <UNK> himself from br br i'm sure if you give <UNK> a fair chance you'll appreciate it's good qualities
<START> br br spoilers in this review br br the long kiss <UNK> is yet another prime example of a common <UNK> of many modern films it starts off on a very interesting concept a trained assassin whose memory was <UNK> <UNK> consciousness of herself and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers don't know very well where to go next and the whole thing <UNK> off down increasingly confusing and or inane paths leaving the disappointing taste of something that was ok but promised to be a lot better the baddies are remarkably <UNK> and even jackson's comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre pulp fiction days it looks like <UNK> as in <UNK> island made every effort so that no one would <UNK> his then wife her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they weren't able to do something better with it br br however there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the run of the mill hollywood <UNK> and places it above average if only just it is something very subtle i can't quite put my finger on it's a disturbing cold dark even <UNK> edge a nightmarish and unreal feel a <UNK> air a mean streak which keeps <UNK> up in various ways it's in the dark <UNK> photography and almost permanent night the characters <UNK> in it's in <UNK> dreams in front of the mirror it's in her vicious eyes and smile whenever she's about to kill a man or when she <UNK> how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening it's in <UNK> comeback at the wheel of a car while he is <UNK> so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak i don't know it's an atmosphere something i can't define but which gives me the creeps a bit and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me
<START> i agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love in fact it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother i actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how canadian indian second generations feel about sex at any rate did you know the first hotel drunk idea was copied from a korean movie made in 2001 or <UNK> that korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time <UNK> the audience to reflect on the complexity of man woman relationships and man woman difference in experience and thinking i mean most of the <UNK> n <UNK> hotel drunk segment was <UNK> take by take can't bollywood movie makers try to make originals only please seriously i never enjoyed a hindi flick that is a <UNK> the ones i enjoy have always spoken indian feelings through indian cultural means
<START> i got some free tickets via the times to see this little know irish movie called <UNK> i'm <UNK> i didn't know a thing about it so had no <UNK> before i went in br br the film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel <UNK> and live in a home michael steven robertson suffers from <UNK> and <UNK> james <UNK> suffers from muscular <UNK> please excuse any spelling mistakes they form a bond as <UNK> seems to be the only person who can understand what michael is saying they eventually leave the home to live in a flat in by themselves they immediately employ the help of an attractive girl <UNK> <UNK> to look after them the two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman thats the story in a nutshell but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way in fact being <UNK> as i was i found the tears were flowing way too often in fact i don't think i've cried so much watching a movie since the elephant man this film is a huge drain on the emotions both in the fun stuff and the sad stuff the acting is absolutely spot on james <UNK> is my tip for greatness he's a great irish actor and i think he has a great future ahead of him steven robertson who plays michael was superb too and it wasn't until today that i found out that he doesn't suffer from <UNK> and it was just some superb acting brenda <UNK> is also in this film and plays the part of the manager very well the other great part has to be <UNK> <UNK> she was wonderful as the love interest and i <UNK> we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the near future br br the thing that makes this film work is not only the between the two leads but the script which is just so witty it literally is on fire i still can't help repeating some of the lines in my head even now br br the photography is good although very bleak but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ireland the music is great in this film too as well as the choice in songs the use of the johnny cash cover of the nine inch nails track is inspired br br if i had to sum this film up in one word it would be this film is very very funny and then on the turn of a <UNK> its very very sad i still can't believe that still two days after seeing the film looking back on it i both laugh and almost cry this film is amazing and i hope it goes far although i can't see that as its advertising budget is probably very small br br so go see it i urge you you wont regret it
<START> style over substance but what a style it is the cell is the internal version of most serial killer movies unfortunately the story hardly supports the visuals br br <UNK> catherine <UNK> j lo goes into her <UNK> dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their <UNK> and <UNK> a new patient whose fallen into a coma is brought to her attention by the fbi he's a serial killer who <UNK> his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like <UNK> <UNK> must enter the killer's mind and <UNK> through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim br br director <UNK> has incredible visions and set pieces for this production each dream sequence is like a nightmare ish painting in motion from the landscapes to the costumes br br but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters is the only person with a <UNK> background and he's the last person you want to care about without him you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway though she's as gorgeous as ever and vince vaughn i don't even know why he was chosen this is not his <UNK> and he overacts to boot he tried too hard to become his character and it showed stick to comedy vince even so this movie is so visually frightening i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward
<START> the four la cops in <UNK> driving around in a big black <UNK> look <UNK> absurd and even more ridiculous when it turns out that nick nolte the dumbest looking of the lot is in charge the writer never manages to create a spirit of <UNK> among the squad members and the director fails to <UNK> out of the man mountain nolte questioning anyone <UNK> character lights a gets mad and beats <UNK> to a pulp his methods get him nowhere until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed <UNK> to tossed <UNK> with his mouth open and his brain shut he <UNK> up an fbi squad and throws two military officers out of a plane in flight with only a vague report of anger at <UNK> and no punishment at all at the end of the film he is as <UNK> and muscle bound as he was at the outset how he managed to get a beautiful whore to fall deeply in love with him is a mystery as is the eternal devotion and tragic sense of betrayal expressed by his <UNK> wife two interesting shots in the picture one of an atomic explosion the other of a gigantic <UNK> ostensibly caused by a bomb it's almost as <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> face
<START> simply put this movies is without any substance whatsoever just take my word for it and save yourself the time it is a complete dud i would say the characters are one dimensional but that would imply there was some sort of character development i thought eric roberts was going to jump out any second it was so close to b movie status br br the girl from that 70's is beautiful but unless you are a stalker type fan of hers this movie has nothing for anyone br br avoid avoid avoid br br this movie was straight to dvd for a reason that being it is a train wreck
<START> once again bugs bunny sacred home is <UNK> by <UNK> people this time the traveling circus put a <UNK> cage right over the hole so bug's has to come out of the hole and face <UNK> that's the name of the lion which he does in his usual hilarious style after a slow and rocky beginning to the <UNK> it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious <UNK> the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one if still <UNK> of a classic this animated short can be found on <UNK> 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 3 br br my grade a
<START> to this day there isn't a movie i've seen more times than the <UNK> adventure nor has any movie brought me more happiness this is by no means the greatest film or even the greatest animated film but to an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest funniest most exciting film ever i'm still equally as impressed today with the musical numbers each one a standout song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80's pop think pat on <UNK> only <UNK> br br controversy has <UNK> over the blatantly suggestive tone of the song <UNK> lucky with you which to me seemed much more innocent at the time however looking at it as a rational adult i can totally understand the concern you've got three young girls in skimpy <UNK> outfits <UNK> <UNK> getting lucky is what it's all about the were definitely <UNK> <UNK> for this movie br br but this controversial issue doesn't even come close to <UNK> the otherwise fabulous feature length animated adventure i encourage parents and <UNK> adults alike to check out this movie especially if you were a child of the eighties early nineties like me
<START> i have some great memories watching robin of <UNK> on tv as a kid but i think i only saw michael episodes by some reason and recently my brother bought the new released dvd boxes of the complete series it was great to see it again and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv series the cast is great and the locations mixed with music adds this very special feeling i personally think that is the best of the two <UNK> but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with ray <UNK> nicolas grace and robert is terrific in their roles as will scarlet the sheriff of <UNK> and guy of it´s a pity that a fourth season never got made and <UNK> also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series robert of <UNK> connery could finally have married marion <UNK> or maybe the hunter could <UNK> robin of and he could take his revenge against the sheriff as have been mentioned before if the producers of robin hood the prince of thieves would have been smart they would have got the cast from robin of <UNK> and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series as ray <UNK> puts it in the dvd it would have been great to see them as old men just like in sean robin and <UNK> who knows maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future in any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again
<START> note this should probably be read only after watching the film br br it is very rare to find a documentary or movie that focuses on the loser deep water does just this making it one of the most thought provoking films in a very long time it does not provide us with a hero to look up to but rather an anti hero who forces us to look into ourselves br br the film is about a group of men who attempt to <UNK> around the globe <UNK> and without stopping only one makes it several die one decides not to return home each of them on a psychological journey intriguing enough to merit entire films for themselves yet the most interesting is donald or rather the way that he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as viewers br br by any standards this man should be considered a despicable character yet why is he depicted so <UNK> why are we so sympathetic to him from the beginning he made all of the wrong choices he <UNK> his family <UNK> to get the boat he left at a more dangerous time to get more publicity he ignored all of the <UNK> despite his lack of experience he chose to lie instead of <UNK> defeat these choices <UNK> until the inevitable and final one suicide all for what a place in history a feeling of accomplishment perhaps what is important to consider is whether this mans situation was inevitable br br each individual must ask himself if his natural human drive for fame and accomplishment would bring him to such <UNK> and i believe that <UNK> your own reaction to story will offer at least some answer to that question
<START> this film has an amazing cast mgm took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable margaret o'brien lionel barrymore edward arnold and lewis stone star as three greedy old <UNK> who live in the same home while they have <UNK> a fortune over the years they also have been selfish <UNK> one of them has an idea to <UNK> some property in order to buy themselves a good name sort of like <UNK> but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to o'brien and since she's an orphan they <UNK> to be her <UNK> so they can give her property away and look like great br br there also is a goofy subplot involving <UNK> led by the wonderful character actor henry <UNK> and since o'brien is irish as <UNK> by her outrageous accent she and the little people make up much of the plot frankly i absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished they'd just dropped it entirely instead the story could still have been about sweet margaret melting the mean old men's hearts this would have worked but the little people <UNK> overall the actors try very very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe i noticed a lot of people liked this film i guess i'm just an old <UNK> i found the film horrible difficult to watch
<START> yep those of my generation who grew up watching those old cartoons were spoiled the 80's joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television well written stories well developed characters granted it was nothing more that a <UNK> toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line fast forward almost twenty years later and enter <UNK> vs <UNK> the animation was average at most the movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like the movie felt more like a small soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force then we have character development or lack there of dusty likes to be all dusty slice and <UNK> like to do things together what did the writers take a writing course on how to develops characters with the depth equivalent of jar jar <UNK> as for the story i like a bit of sci fi but that whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been done to death in the joe universe mega monsters or zombies anyone but i give the creators credit for trying to make the fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes i'm not a huge fan of se and ss but i did like the fight scenes between the two if you can appreciate for what it is you will enjoy it i admit to not being able to appreciate as i should again everything joe gets compared to what ways done in the 80's and honestly nothing will ever compare to the glory days of <UNK> joe if you can appreciate for what it is you will enjoy it
<START> it's also the best book i've ever read karl urban and steve are great together it had drama adventure and <UNK> and sadness i laughed i cried it's hard not to laugh when gus is talking i wish gus would have <UNK> clara like he did <UNK> clara just lead gus on all those years with no intentions of ever marrying him she just liked playing with him it was sad that he spent his whole life <UNK> for her it would have been nice if <UNK> had married maggie but she would have just died on him anyway <UNK> was a man that could not express his feelings and kept them <UNK> up it was obvious that he loved maggie after the raid on austin when the rangers got back and he ran to hold her val kilmer is excellent at playing odd characters i loved his portrayal of <UNK> <UNK> skull i loved the whole <UNK> <UNK> saga <UNK> moon is the best of the bunch
<START> as a massive fan of <UNK> it goes without saying that i have seen this film numerous times however i watch it purely for the concert footage the rest of the film is um pretty dreadful sad to say br br famed rock music film director da followed mode around on their late 80s music for the masses tour which promoted the superb album of the same name the title 101 <UNK> mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the <UNK> and final concert of the tour at the <UNK> bowl but is also a reference to the movie being a on the band and how it <UNK> ie mode 101 amidst footage of the <UNK> playing live and exploring america is a second story thread covering a group of <UNK> fans who've won a competition to meet the band go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig br br now as i said above the concert footage is great mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an band back in the late 80s though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece <UNK> there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here <UNK> behind the wheel the <UNK> never let me down again everything counts just can't get enough from the vince clarke years shake the disease and many more br br when mode are <UNK> they are brilliant when they are not they're well very boring nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the <UNK> as they check out the us in the dying days of the reagan administration as an example the <UNK> highlight of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy <UNK> not exactly thrilling stuff i know all bands don't have to be wild and reckless idiots but these guys make the mormon choir look like br br the only real excitement comes from various clips <UNK> on the <UNK> lead singer dave comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic talking about a violent power inside himself he can't control <UNK> a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on there's one point in the film where he throws a <UNK> donna <UNK> at some poor guy <UNK> truly embarrassing the man clearly had issues back then which thankfully have been resolved <UNK> martin gore and <UNK> andy <UNK> are presented as very <UNK> clearly <UNK> talented but also utterly <UNK> men while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member alan wilder is the only one of the <UNK> who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of <UNK> br br and as for the <UNK> thread well it's unwatchable <UNK> let's not kid ourselves maybe it's just because it's all so very late 80s but the <UNK> of young <UNK> do little for me but raise a feeling of <UNK> they are to a person <UNK> shallow and vapid people whose antics are banal when they aren't hide your face <UNK> let me <UNK> nothing happens in the footage that isn't <UNK> that is of any interest nothing endless scenes of kids <UNK> their hair arguing <UNK> changing their clothes getting lost in cities on the way to <UNK> and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing if cure fans were this mind <UNK> dull back in <UNK> <UNK> the love the youngsters have for the band is something i can definitely relate to and is at times <UNK> <UNK> but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them then i'd hate to see the <UNK> br br but the music is all that matters and in this regard 101 excels the <UNK> concert one of their all time best <UNK> makes the film worth seeing the recent dvd edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the <UNK> concert footage a good 80 of the performance and thus makes the dvd an absolute must for fans the audio commentary by the band minus wilder who left mode in the mid 90s on the first disc is also oddly far more interesting than the film itself br br as a document of the boys from during their idol period mode 101 is <UNK> but if you're looking for excitement you're better off getting the accompanying double live album now available in super audio cd format
<START> made it through the first half an hour and deserved a <UNK> for getting that far lots of excuses for scantily clad women but no real plot to speak of emerged in that time what sounded like a good idea for a movie was badly executed
<START> for me a ten star film is one that never dies in my memory and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time this could be a technically flawed movie the pleasure has nothing to do with spit and polish my personal top ten is <UNK> to say the least john carpenter's the thing is one of very few films to fit this <UNK> br br i've been a science fiction fan since i was a child in the sixties and i read the john w campbell short story on which the film is based who goes there before i saw the original black and white howard <UNK> film as with a lot of people that viewing was <UNK> on the tv when i should have been in bed that movie as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances seemed near perfection the suspense the inexplicable nature of the alien the photography it all just seemed to work i watched it many times in the years after and still do when it is shown on tv because of this i avoided the carpenter version for years seeing remakes of one's favourite film is i thought always a mistake when i did eventually watch it sometime in 1988 9 again on tv because there was nothing else on i realised that i need to change always a mistake to usually a mistake carpenter had produced something different from the original film closer to the original story and truly wonderful from the opening scene of the helicopter and <UNK> through the <UNK> disturbing scene in the dog pound to that ending sorry no spoilers here i was hooked the sound track alone lives with me all i have to hear is a close similarity to that bass over <UNK> drum beat and i'm in the final scene again br br until seeing the thing i had carpenter down as just another gore monkey based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press since seeing the thing i think i have seen most of his movies i haven't gone out of my to do so but if one comes up just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it he is thoughtful and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory br br if you haven't seen the thing and you enjoy science fiction do yourself a favour sit down in a dark room wrap up warm and prepare to have your memory enhanced
<START> this production build on real danish crime stories is a experience through excellent directing acting on all levels and has a nerve not often seen in crime series every episode is a thrill because it's seems like the hole team believe that this is my life right now this murder or murders are my responsibility to solve and the <UNK> is brilliant br br as a viewer you just have this wonderfully filling of being entertained cause it feels like their focus on purpose or not lie on that they wont you to have a good time o don't miss this one it's just right under <UNK> of <UNK> quality and is a must have seen experience what a wonderful crime time
<START> the best bit in the film was when alan pulled down her <UNK> and ran the cut throat razor over her bum <UNK> and around her bum hole it was also brilliant to see <UNK> bum going up and down like a <UNK> later on in the film br br alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed <UNK> onto the <UNK> br br i've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit a brilliant idea by the script writers alan must be brought back into <UNK> so he can do the same to peggy br br alan is back and this time he's armed with a razor watch out if you're a girl and he finds you and pulls your <UNK> down
<START> being a big fan of stanley kubrick's clockwork orange there was of course no question about it that i had to see this one however i put it off far too long because some of my friends <UNK> it with comments like extremely boring or nothing happened a complete waste of time but when i saw images on the internet of the mysterious black <UNK> i was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001 a space odyssey there was no doubt in my mind that i was going to rent that movie the same evening br br it turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life of course watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of <UNK> in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it my god i like my friends a lot but it's a pity that i can't share with them the very thing that makes my heart jump up with excitement and makes my spirit fly like a bird in the sky that thing my friends is beauty as this film goes to show beauty is terribly underrated in our <UNK> advanced intellectually shallow <UNK> driven fast food western societies that doesn't mean however that i reject these fast paced societies or that i look down on them and neither does kubrick but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to <UNK> the sheer beauty of the world we live in and what better opportunity is there to do this then by <UNK> down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming br br when we go to this place it is possible to get a so called natural high it is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and <UNK> beauty and never in my life has this natural high or spiritual <UNK> as it is called by some or by others been more intense yes it's more intense than a regular <UNK> several times more intense actually many <UNK> have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right are they right for me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the <UNK> mesmerizing mystery of the universe in my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black <UNK> and by stating the following about it except for a single very powerful radio <UNK> aimed at <UNK> the four million year old black <UNK> has remained completely <UNK> its origin and purpose are still a total mystery the <UNK> that <UNK> experiences is the same thing i experience when watching those gorgeous visuals br br i can imagine that mystery can be frustrating for those who need straight fast food answers to big questions but instead of giving us comfort we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the <UNK> that are contained in these answers the doubt and <UNK> that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame but this film shows us that when fast statements give rise to nothing but doubt we can always rely on <UNK> to make some sense out of the world from the moment you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented to us as a phenomenon and never as a thing in itself the mysterious black <UNK> is no longer disturbing frightening or irritating but instead becomes fascinating enchanting and maybe even <UNK> we don't need an answer to what's really out there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives when we are able to let mystery be what it is to embrace it even we can finally bring our souls to rest i am pretty sure though that a film that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be <UNK> especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us
<START> i've read all the <UNK> <UNK> on this muddled semi noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems in the cruel light of 2007 a very sloppy late rko <UNK> line product all that endless documentary footage of fish waves fish waves has little to do with the central conflict and just <UNK> the running time the editing is downright <UNK> scenes just end and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what <UNK> them the dialog bears the stilted <UNK> of the <UNK> origins high <UNK> <UNK> that never could have come from the limited <UNK> of these <UNK> people but what's really surprising is how horribly <UNK> the triangle is on all sides i love stanwyck but she <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> out wildly an <UNK> performance several <UNK> below her standard douglas <UNK> at being lovable then goes onto a would be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy as is ryan <UNK> and shouting most <UNK> the less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior keith whose character is kind of a <UNK> by today's standards nevertheless is smooth and <UNK> as <UNK> much younger one <UNK> brother and marilyn monroe as his girlfriend is natural and <UNK> on <UNK> coast and all that footage while largely irrelevant is interesting as a document of what the town looked like amid all the <UNK> <UNK> these two are islands of sanity a final point and a spoiler perhaps the <UNK> office <UNK> it but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second stanwyck may <UNK> have into being an <UNK> but i give the marriage a month
<START> this film without doubt is the <UNK> example of the british humour the germans can't understand one liners run rampant in a film <UNK> one of the greatest series of films in british cinema history st <UNK> the story of <UNK> incompetence amid post war trials <UNK> frank to direct maximum talent from all the cast it's probably the only film in which margaret <UNK> meets her match in <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> characterisation she still wins though <UNK> bless her and richard both deserve mentions in masterpiece of english <UNK> and stiff upper lip under pressure br br no <UNK> <UNK> fan would be without this in their collection absolutely brilliant why 9 10 only long
<START> this was the typical women prison movie i thought the women were very sexy and the outfits were great all the camera did was focus on the women and the women were always in provocative poses for the camera and they were always scantily dressed which i loved this is your basic prison <UNK> movie of the 70's all i can say about this film is that it's extremely cheesy but the women are gorgeous and their <UNK> are great
<START> spoilers spoilers spoilers just a few small ones br br saw this on channel missed the first 30 min of movie will keep this comment short and informative br br the movie is basically about 5 characters the acting is very bad for <UNK> characters 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it <UNK> and the 3 kidnap the 2 this is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical mysterious and you get the point but do to their own personal lack in thinking they fall terribly short like one of the <UNK> who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd looks the part but his tongue can't speak it the writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words <UNK> <UNK> i believe that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it i wish i could give an example but i cant recall any exactly as it was said the ending was bad as well but the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady although she as well as the rest had a lot of cliché s br br so why would i give this movie a 7 stars if i thought all the above simple i give the entire seven stars to lisa <UNK> one sexy a <UNK> she is fine lol i am an <UNK> of beauty and she is exactly that but don't get me confused because i'm not a <UNK> and this movie is not a porno in any way their is <UNK> about her i cant explain but i like it i remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out <UNK> into <UNK> she tries to get way but she doesn't have a chance he throws her down <UNK> on the stairs and he pulls her pants down no <UNK> now although she has an amazing ass and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think it was her facial expression that got me she wanted it and that look had me thinking i was behind that i would have torn that <UNK> up after that expression i <UNK> couldn't look at her <UNK> anymore i was in love lol i am glad to have seen this movie but if lisa <UNK> wasn't playing the lead role i would have changed the channel well after i had seen the scene i mentioned above i am a lisa <UNK> fan know but is seems that she isn't a consistent actor seeing this 2003 movie is her latest but i am <UNK> forward to another movie with her in it
<START> lots of scenes and dialogue are flat out goofy but when you add it all up i e daily cycle from depressing to depressing bar to depressing <UNK> hall to depressing smoke filled poker games and back home again you get a weird sense that somebody somewhere is trying to give a faithful depiction of the life circa 1955 whether it's sinatra who obviously would have <UNK> up against this type of character growing up in <UNK> and working in numerous bands or preminger who uses the soundtrack and the frankie subtext to slip the <UNK> interior <UNK> past the <UNK> code cage you get a good companion piece to on the <UNK> which was filmed almost exactly the same time sort of a faux <UNK> work that leaves you realistically wondering how deep the drug culture is <UNK> in american life
<START> i watched this on tv in 1989 and <UNK> not <UNK> it i was very intriguing and suspenseful it is amazing as the events unfold and this man's past catches up with him br br the acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims twist of fate but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie
<START> i have never seen a movie so bad it's not even entertaining enough to be a drinking game br br it's so bad i don't even want to talk about it and that's the whole point of this isn't it please don't bother to see this movie said
<START> i am 17 and a biased muppet fan and while i love treasure island christmas carol and great muppet caper the muppet movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them it is enormously entertaining thanks to the snappy script by jerry and the film looks lovely with some beautifully staged musical numbers speaking of the songs i really liked them sure they aren't the best song score out of the muppet franchise but they were very nice to listen to especially never before never before is now one of my favourite muppet songs along with first time it happens and professional pirate the muppets as usual were fantastic particularly the always delightful miss <UNK> and the chemistry between <UNK> and <UNK> was great and what a brilliant human cast from bob hope to orson welles from madeleine <UNK> the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like what's up doc blazing <UNK> and clue to <UNK> <UNK> from steve martin to richard <UNK> all of whom made memorable guest appearances if careful not to <UNK> the muppets in a fantastic film 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> this short is one of the best of all time and is proof just like most of charlie <UNK> work that sound and color are not <UNK> for quality work in fact this cartoon uses and may have started some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years like caricatures of celebrities including the <UNK> mentioned chaplin while the characters are silent they do speak by use of word <UNK> just like in the comics given that felix started out in <UNK> as a comic strip this device is a natural the atmosphere and style of the short is completely <UNK> with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension literally and <UNK> and makes this short a delight to watch well worth taking the time and effort to get most highly recommended
<START> when i went to see this film let's not say that i had high expectations but merely that i had a faint hope that this full length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and wit of tv's da ali g show br br but as one might expect this cannot translate from a half hour tv show to a 90 minute film the movie had no appeal what so ever and <UNK> entirely to toilet and juvenile sexual humour <UNK> i should have <UNK> it halfway through but was silly enough to think it might somehow improve by the end how wrong i was i loved the show but hated the movie this movie is only for those who find <UNK> by <UNK> amusing
<START> i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely <UNK> its success but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place it was more about the story the characters and their relationships is that not what films are supposed to be about but it did have a quality in the <UNK> of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive a lot can be learned from watching this film technically it has everything going for it the use of light music etc by far <UNK> that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise the actors performances are believable to a point if not slightly under played i felt there was much more in there more depth in particular from the male lead john paul clarke but one thing that really does bother me as a film maker myself is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a <UNK> of sins than if it was colour do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology or is this the future of wonderful <UNK> film making
<START> did this gem go direct to video fabulous art direction mood that never misses a beat the truman show meets metropolis an excellent cast i've never seen laura dern better and bill macy is always fabulous same said for david <UNK> and meat <UNK> this is just an incredible film
<START> i thought that this was actually the best vampire movie that i've ever seen i've seen a lot too the effects were great and the casting was brilliant it was an all around good movie the makeup and costumes were great too i would recommend it but not for kids it's not a children's movie
<START> i am not a fan by any means but watched this with a friend as there wasn't anything else on the box at the time thank goodness not only did we laugh from start to finish but about a week later in the pub when we started discussing it we made a right spectacle of ourselves with <UNK> laughter does that pitch actually exist i have released my e mail here so if anyone hears about it's future <UNK> or a repeat on the telly please let me know definitely the funniest thing i've seen on television king <UNK> was good too another tim <UNK> classic
<START> being relatively young i didn't know how bad anti <UNK> was in brooklyn where my family is originally from this movie absolutely horrified me i've seen many movies about prejudice racism and anti <UNK> but this seemed to hit me harder than most br br this was definitely one of the best indie films i've ever seen i had to travel 45 minutes to see it and it was well worth it nearly everything about the movie was great sometimes it was a little slow but that didn't really bother me because the movie was very atmospheric it took place in the 40s and it really did look like it was the 40s the acting was great william h macy as always was wonderful so was laura dern and i was pleasantly surprised by performance playing the vicious anti <UNK> neighbor br br 9 10
<START> i have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it garbage a travesty an sequel is just unfair i mean what else could they have made for a sequel then cause seriously i think it should have had a sequel rodney <UNK> says hey everyone were all going to get laid and then a little dancing and thats it thats the end of <UNK> even though the film rating on first one was r and the second one was pg it was still lots of fun br br 7 10
<START> in most parts a <UNK> dull venture is about this dancer choreographer who regards herself as some kind of auteur beyond the petty commercial <UNK> that people around her including her actor beau <UNK> bachchan build their careers on nice idea only it turns out that she has the most bad concepts about costumes and dance movements stuff rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra cheap south indian <UNK> <UNK> in severe embarrassment br br the story follows a yawn inducing predictable pattern dancer and beau meet and have an affair yes sex included beau gets success but she <UNK> his attempts to help her beau throws attitude and they walk out on each other dancer meets a most unlikely director who wants her <UNK> do what she <UNK> effort <UNK> even more <UNK> popularity attempts to reach out are <UNK> until a climax where he bursts out about how he can't live without her d uh end br br actually i didn't really expect this film to be much good so why did i watch it because i have an fetish she's an actress with imo sufficient talent to reach grand heights provided she has the opportunity alas her role in the film looks far better on paper than in actual execution ironic for a film that's supposed to be about an <UNK> character to give her credit she puts in a game effort shining well in the few scenes that actually ask of her as an actress i just wish the movie had been more worthy of her <UNK> bachchan also throws in a few good punches the last scene <UNK> somewhat by a <UNK> turn which pleasantly reminds you of his father br br only recommended if you can sit through <UNK> <UNK> of for the return of a few of good moments courtesy the lead actors
<START> i originally posted the first user comment on this movie and claimed it was crap and it didnt make sense i didnt make sense <UNK> tales is a thoroughly enjoying film now that im 2 years older and watched it last night the actors were famous but not too famous the acting itself was more than acceptable it was rather good i will rate the movie per segment of films br br 1 the black and white scene a k a the hook this one was rather pointless it looked good but didnt hold much grip at all the only disappointing one i dont think it was even included as a segment here is the scare o <UNK> br br poor br br 2 the r v story <UNK> stuck in woods possibly the most entertaining of all tales the acting was good in this one too <UNK> bout the typical <UNK> sex scenes yet it was you think who was knocking on that door it had suspense and not too gory liked this one br br very good br br 3 internet chat tale little girl meets psycho this was a smart addition gore left at a minimal <UNK> left at extreme although dull at times the last few minutes were most entertaining dont get me wrong it was still fun to watch real creepy and could happen to anybody so watch who <UNK> talking to br br very good br br 4 ghost tale man kisses ghost not the best it <UNK> too atmospheric for a ghost tale this one was strange the aspects were rather good playing music and the screaming but everything was too real to be ghastly although it was good it was quiet bloody and could have been better with that idea br br acceptable br br 5 the ending the 4 lost teenagers these are the 2 attractive <UNK> and guys telling the tales through out the film the best thing about the film is the ending it set a great impression the ending was totally un expected watch it it was so well done the realism was spectacular br br top notch br br 6 the film overall <UNK> tales was more than i used to take it for i actually like it so much now im buying it on video cause its a truly entertaining horror movie forget the trash you see these days like many im <UNK> that this didnt really go nowhere it was straight to video to me it was better than all the hype horror you see these days overall for <UNK> tales br br very good br br 8 out of 10
<START> it's astonishing that some people saw this as art we saw it as a poorly filmed shaky hand held camera and all generally badly acted <UNK> mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids <UNK> in black white film making <UNK> <UNK> of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make when we watched this in the theatre people were starting to have fits of the <UNK> us included at the endless stupidity of this self indulgent meandering mess and believe me it does seem endless had we finished our candy and popcorn we too would have walked out of the theatre with the other two dozen people who packed up and left looking for something more interesting to do
<START> i'll start <UNK> the movie first remove <UNK> and <UNK> from the cast and you've got a badly colored movie stiff cardboard from the casting department badly dubbed sound especially during the singing and annoying dialog ex listen to the line mr ad <UNK> obviously some studio hack thought that they could cash in on disney's classic presentation of mickey and the but maybe audiences were either more <UNK> back then improbable or stuck in a double feature more <UNK> even children should feel insulted at having this movie shown to them a total waste of celluloid now about the acting of <UNK> and <UNK> bud <UNK> always played the straight man and by all accounts was the <UNK> person off the set on radio his character was usually the smooth fast <UNK> and was especially funny when his speed caused him to <UNK> his lines and smooth over the mistakes in the movies he still plays the straight man but is more of a con artist not that he's bad at it but that character has been played to perfection by <UNK> marx the real travesty of the duo on film is lou <UNK> again on radio he was funny he played a character that was a little slower than <UNK> but not too much slower he was also <UNK> with the lines and got me laughing when he would ad <UNK> at <UNK> mistakes on film i don't know if it was his decision or not but in the movies his character becomes a shoddy <UNK> of stan laurel which in turn was even more <UNK> done by jerry lewis why the change he was funny on radio when he was a but here he becomes a child like character that looks like he's <UNK> for the cameras in every shot this characterization is shown in every movie they do and only brings a <UNK> to the reputation they had on radio what is left to their film career is a poor very very poor copy of laurel and hardy the movies would have been much funnier if they had played their radio characters instead of <UNK> of stock casting
<START> this is the most stupid movie ever made the story is laughable his wife and kid think he's insane then they don't then it turns out he is and i think they knew it all along there is a dog named ned that causes some problems and i think it's all his fault so does jim carey god only knows why virginia madsen took this role this is a career <UNK> i think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds and that adds up to 23 or maybe it's for 8 and 10 years olds which also adds up to 23 or maybe it's for really dumb 23 year olds or maybe really dumb <UNK> year olds because that's 23 in reverse or maybe <UNK> year olds would enjoy it because half of that is 23 i think looking up things on the internet about the number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie unless you wanted to see a comedy
<START> this particular film was one that i wanted to see in theaters but never got around to it when i finally rented it in the summer of 2001 i enjoyed it so much that i went out and bought the dvd soon after bonnie hunt and don lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the dvd they did a great job in creating characters that you really care about i really felt a <UNK> of emotions watching this film including sadness anxiety and joy the film also does a great job in showing the importance of family a <UNK> in film today which is a reflection of the director bonnie hunt based on the comments she made on the dvd david duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond fox <UNK> giving a wonderful performance with some pretty poignant scenes i highly recommend that you give this movie a viewing i am really thankful to the creators of this film they have given me a wonderful piece of cinematic viewing that i will recommend to all my friends i have seen a lot of movies over the years and it is very rare that i come away with such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a film i will watch this time and time again for years to come return to me reminds me that there are still <UNK> out there that know how to sincerely please their movie audiences thanks
<START> probably will contain spoilers br br after a successful attempt to get attention i would not call making sure that you get help before you die a failed suicide attempt joey finds out that she is pregnant and starts seeing images of spirits br br overall the movie was a little slow going but entertaining enough to watch the whole thing for a horror movie there were only a few minor creeps and thrills halfway through however was a really good scary scene i wont give it away though i watched this movie because i really liked the <UNK> movie the eye br br i was a little confused however to determine that other than being a supernatural suspense movie from the same creators the eye 2 had no relation to the eye whatsoever different cast different story the does not even have anything to do with eyes br br the movie had a few questionable scenes joey attempts suicide 3 times 4 times if you count the time when witnesses say they saw joey trying to jump in front of the train she is associated with brutally <UNK> an <UNK> she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she was attacking people and yet she is allowed to go about her business <UNK> without even so much as a psyche <UNK> or put in the hospital for reasons other than her <UNK> br br the movie was not the greatest horror movie the story was rather far fetched even for a fiction movie p the <UNK> were either few and or nothing we have not seen before however it was an interesting story and once you know what the truth is behind the <UNK> it was an interesting twist on the ghost story br br i rate the movie 3 out of 10
<START> for those who are like me and are used to watch and enjoy high budget hollywood films on huge screens with a surround audio this film seems to be so distant however it surprised me how close can it be to any human while i watch it it is so natural that you feel like nobody wrote a scenario or nobody directed it you are the director and you are writing the scenario while you watch it for me the time i spend on watching a film is the only time which i go to another world this film is the first <UNK> for me which shows that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of budgeted films surround audio <UNK> to go to another world this films sends you to another world or maybe makes you return back to yourself without millions of dollars of budget or technical <UNK> i felt like that i'm reading from <UNK>
<START> there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box office failures an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that for once an indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience and not <UNK> out a <UNK> khan type <UNK> typical <UNK> the movie is about two guys who dream of <UNK> and try to accomplish that by <UNK> a <UNK> daughter a humorous drama unfolds while a lot of <UNK> surface in the story the <UNK> add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot <UNK> khan plays the a street smart guy while salman khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy the <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> and his henchmen junior and make you laugh in your sleep although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies despite shoddy <UNK> and despite being loud at times it remains one of the <UNK> funny movies <UNK> has come up with after movies like and other movies it is sad that it didn't do well at the box office for that means producers turn back to <UNK> and creativity is abandoned
<START> a scientific experiment designed to create a <UNK> being has gone wrong the creators become trapped in a remote desert <UNK> pursued relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creation james <UNK> the scientist whose research was used despite his <UNK> to create the monster is called the <UNK> to help <UNK> the horror that now <UNK> somewhere within the dark <UNK> james together with his son and daughter soon find themselves trapped inside with the others trying desperately to survive and with the <UNK> sealed from within there is no way out the <UNK> mind <UNK> is highly unoriginal the sets are pretty claustrophobic and there's a bit of gore however as a horror it fails miserably on almost all levels there's zero suspense the script is weak and filled with big holes and the ending is extremely predictable so called master wes craven produced this one i wonder if he is happy with this trash joe directs without any style the acting is horrible only lance <UNK> can act at all ok i'm a big horror fan and was <UNK> disappointed avoid it like the plague it's just the same old boring crap again
<START> this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and i stopped caring this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex there's a <UNK> and a <UNK> put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports br br sounds promising br br not really br br i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film basically i started not watching which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up br br it may work for you it didn't for me
<START> <UNK> i've always thought is the most accessible of shakespeare's <UNK> plays <UNK> focused with <UNK> of violence it should have been the play most open to screen adaptations i'm not aware of a really good rendering of the story however the best effort being orson <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> version to the list of we must add the connery effort br br it seems it was not a <UNK> at all but a tv version that was given a theatrical release post romeo juliet and branagh's hamlet that might explain some of its flaws but doesn't excuse them br br it starts well with a <UNK> battle sequence with <UNK> grisly witches looking on poor old gray and are cut from the opening scene but they aren't alone for long in quick order they are joined by the <UNK> <UNK> and his account of the battle the <UNK> of the of the <UNK> master <UNK> the tiger even <UNK> meeting with <UNK> when he is invested as of all of these had virtues that <UNK> like angels <UNK> <UNK> against the dark <UNK> of their sending off but sent off they are these aren't the only cuts either this is <UNK> in a hurry br br from the opening battle we are pitched directly into <UNK> encounter with the witches which is well done brian blessed curiously directed the <UNK> sequences and he has great fun with the special effects as <UNK> and <UNK> are told of their <UNK> jason connery as <UNK> is awkward obviously unsure what to make of the <UNK> graham as <UNK> on the other hand is capable making his lines natural and easy within a few minutes of <UNK> <UNK> the viewer is struck the urge to see the roles <UNK> and in the title role no wonder <UNK> felt he needed to kill him br br these first few minutes marks the high point of the film from there we move to helen receiving word of her husband she's as lost as connery and denied the beard that he gets to hide behind her <UNK> me here of evil is embarrassing not unsettling there are some reasonably clever touches <UNK> we will speak further is not a sign of his <UNK> in the face of his wife's wicked ambition but his attempt to silence her <UNK> as he throws her onto the bed br br the acting of the leads is the biggest let down <UNK> method consists of staring about the screen while he <UNK> his monologues via voice over looks <UNK> and neurotic an attempt to do something interesting with is this a <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is a shadow cast by a cross on an <UNK> falls flat due to <UNK> poor delivery and sloppy direction which mars the production throughout we <UNK> lady <UNK> back into the murder chamber where she gets to stab the <UNK> <UNK> but the effect is comic not dramatic br br big scenes are <UNK> the appearance of <UNK> at the feast is made incomprehensible through attempts to mix <UNK> rendering of <UNK> <UNK> with what those around him see or don't see the second meeting with the witches is even less coherent and the <UNK> visions are confusing timing seems to be an issue here <UNK> is the of the play but the film moves rapidly towards conclusion after it giving it an <UNK> feel and no scope for the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> is caught in to be appreciated or for his descent into madness to be convincing another crucial cut is the scene where malcolm <UNK> and learns of the murder of his family this <UNK> his revenge of most of its emotional force and the character of a lot of the screen time he's a virtual stranger when he turns up to kill <UNK> br br a point for trying <UNK> earns another the first few minutes <UNK> another but that's all from then on it's sound and fury blah blah blah
<START> i can honestly say that death bed the bed that eats was a much better movie than i expected allow me to <UNK> the plot in case the title of the film is a little too vague there is a bed that eats an evil bed it eats people several unsuspecting women on an outing of some kind stumble across the sinister sack and ultimately fall prey to it's <UNK> the <UNK> process consists of a yellow <UNK> <UNK> people into it's inner stomach acid all complete with chewing sounds this is a very strange cult flick and the only film from george barry who had forgotten he made it until word of mouth of it's <UNK> cult status got back to him and he decided to release it on dvd not a bad movie at all if you can look past the lousy acting and enjoy the hokey effects the most laughable being the guy whose hands are eaten off and he is left with only plastic looking <UNK> fingers pretty <UNK> tone to it too coming across as very surreal and <UNK> mainly the whole thing involving the artist behind the painting and the demonic back story of the bed if you like bizarre no budget oddball flicks than definitely seek out death bed

<START> frank it isn't that i'm sorry i killed them it's that i'm sorry i killed them badly br br wow talk about a swing and a miss you have a great cast and a great plot with endless how do you f <UNK> that up well apparently john <UNK> has found a way with an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a <UNK> <UNK> and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable <UNK> kill <UNK> might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007 on a positive note ben provides another great performance as the alcoholic polish hit man trying to get clean but the material he has to work with is crap tea <UNK> is good as well as is luke wilson dennis <UNK> bill <UNK> philip baker hall and the rest of the cast i guess the best way to describe <UNK> kill <UNK> is a terrible movie with good performances grade d

<START> i remember the trailer for this <UNK> weak spin off of conan i saw the movie years later and laughed my head off unintentionally poor <UNK> her career never had a chance thanks to <UNK> and red <UNK> the plot of the movie is this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen bergman queen steals the <UNK> the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by <UNK> goes on a hunt for queen and later finds out that killed her parents on her quest she reluctantly joins arnold <UNK> an arrogant prince named ernie <UNK> jr and his bumbling idiotic servant paul l smith together they go on a hunt for queen and the <UNK> the acting is sub par and the action scenes are <UNK> i mean <UNK> looks so emotionally distant for someone who lost her whole family as well as her female <UNK> <UNK> doesn't look at all arnold is playing his usual stoic role and ernie <UNK> jr what an annoying <UNK> <UNK> brat he was in this movie the moronic <UNK> had more personality than these guys the action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie even though sometimes they fall flat the scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh till my <UNK> <UNK> the dialog is a hoot also its as if the screenwriter thought that nobody was going to take the movie seriously so he gave everybody stupid lines to work with i can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movies extra campy anyone else don't bother
<START> don't change your husband is another soap opera comedy from producer director cecil b de <UNK> it is notable as the first of several films he made starring gloria <UNK> i guess you could also call it a sequel of sorts to his old wives for new <UNK> br br james elliot <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> porter are a forty ish couple where james has gone to seed and become <UNK> and lazy he has a <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> and eating raw <UNK> he takes his wife for granted <UNK> tries to get him to <UNK> out to no <UNK> br br one night at a dinner party at the <UNK> <UNK> meets the dashing van now there's a <UNK> the playboy nephew of <UNK> mrs sylvia <UNK> she invites <UNK> to her home for the weekend to make james miss her once there begins to put the moves on her promising her pleasure wealth and love if she will leave her husband and go with him the sequences involving <UNK> imagining this promised new life are <UNK> staged and <UNK> de <UNK> epic costume later in his career br br <UNK> bored with her marriage and her <UNK> husband <UNK> james and marries the playboy james ultimately realizes that he has lost the only thing that <UNK> to him and begins to <UNK> his ways he <UNK> off his mustache works out <UNK> <UNK> and re <UNK> some manners br br meanwhile all is not <UNK> with <UNK> new marriage it seems likes to <UNK> and has taken up with the gold digging <UNK> aka <UNK> or some such name julia faye loses all of his money and steals <UNK> diamond ring to cover his <UNK> br br one <UNK> day <UNK> meets the new james and is taken by the changes in him james drives her home and becomes aware of her situation and br br this film marked the beginning of gloria rise to super stardom in a career that would rival that of mary pickford barely 20 years of age she had begun her career in mack <UNK> two reel comedies as a teen <UNK> elliot <UNK> was almost 50 at this time but he and <UNK> make a good team although it's hard to imagine anyone <UNK> of the lovely miss <UNK> as is the case in this film br br <UNK> and sylvia <UNK> had appeared in the similar old wives for new where the wife had gone to seed and the husband was <UNK> br br also in the cast are de <UNK> <UNK> theodore roberts as a bishop and raymond <UNK> as a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> del aka the price of power is an excellent and enthralling spaghetti western that mirrors the kennedy assassination a great leading performance by <UNK> <UNK> and an excellent score by luis are just two of the many reasons to watch this movie br br in <UNK> texas is divided into those who appreciate the <UNK> of slavery and just want to live in peace and those who after 16 years still want to <UNK> the <UNK> in spite of <UNK> president james garfield who wants to establish a new policy of <UNK> decides to visit dallas where corrupt law <UNK> officials are planning his assassination bill <UNK> <UNK> and two of his friends a black man named jack <UNK> ray and a crippled guy named nick <UNK> are determined to prevent the <UNK> murder br br since james garfield was not <UNK> by <UNK> who wanted to <UNK> the <UNK> in texas but in washington <UNK> by mentally unstable charles the storyline of price of power is of course historical nonsense since the movie however doesn't claim historical accuracy but tries to <UNK> to the 1963 kennedy assassination in dallas the fact that the story is <UNK> is legitimate br br <UNK> <UNK> delivers an excellent performance as the main character bill <UNK> is great as the villainous and corrupt sheriff <UNK> some other good performances are those of ray as <UNK> black friend jack warren as arthur <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> a villainous rich businessman the score by luis is great the cinematography and locations are great and such as in earlier day of anger remind a lot of sergio <UNK> for whom used to work as an assistant director for a <UNK> of dollars and for a few dollars more br br all said <UNK> del is after day of anger another excellent spaghetti western that shows both the great talent of <UNK> <UNK> as an actor and <UNK> as a director the price of power is a must see for spaghetti western fans and i also highly recommend it to everybody else 8 10
<START> this movie is the best movie i have seen in a long time it is also the best movie seen that uses a drama to tell history without going to <UNK> such as with <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> it <UNK> depicts the <UNK> that <UNK> had on the <UNK> it also <UNK> out easily for us the european and american forces that were behind the power the <UNK> the <UNK> today the film was sure to specifically <UNK> the u s rightly so in the murder of this film could never be made in the u s for u s film rarely <UNK> itself in acts of <UNK> and murder save <UNK> <UNK> it also lets us in on the problems that were present with the inner conflict of the <UNK> between and we can see how <UNK> countries sit in establishing new <UNK> when their history is one of <UNK> and those who were the continue to pull the strings of power and force the film is excellently shot with an excellent the cast is great and they really draw you into the feeling of the climate in the <UNK> during that time br br again this is a must see for those who love drama with a correct historical background see my notes on

<START> <UNK> doesn't even need to be <UNK> since it was never designed to be <UNK> like oscar winning movies are and it was never intended to have won an oscar obviously if you just look at some of the stuff that <UNK> and tried like the fast motion shots it comes across as a film thats something more than just or jackass even though those are cool too for pure <UNK> i definitely give this film a 10 almost every scene made me laugh until my sides hurt like trail movie if you haven't seen this see it and then buy it personally my favorite character is brandon <UNK> he's just so smooth and natural and random that its hilarious he great with the action figures and makes up the funniest stuff lol a diamond mountain bike <UNK> is definitely a movie that in overall humor is only <UNK> by anchorman and <UNK> dynamite
<START> if you're a fan of turkish and middle eastern music you're in great luck this film is a documentary of current music in <UNK> <UNK> the traditional to the modern it's very good you could not do better if you went to <UNK> yourself we get interviews with concert clips of modern musical icons a road show with a gypsy audience turkish hip hop surprisingly very very good and much much more some of the best female i've ever heard a <UNK> woman singing in a steam bath who will rip your heart out lots of social and political background if this is your thing you'll have a grand time i could barely sit still in the theatre br br cd soundtrack now available on amazon <UNK>

<START> based on the true story of the hunt for those who were responsible for the bombing of the world trade center building a very good film that <UNK> into the use of <UNK> and how possibly the tragedy could have been avoided 7 of 10
<START> caution spoilers br br although this film moved a bit slow at times the brilliant scenery <UNK> of the characters and powerful themes make <UNK> a a rewarding experience i have not read thomas <UNK> book but i am certain that <UNK> visual <UNK> musical score and powerful <UNK> of conflict and desire must do it justice br br the study of <UNK> von <UNK> to the human tendency to <UNK> and our emotions behaviour and passion this tendency is demonstrated in the scene in germany between alfred and <UNK> when alfred describes music as being both <UNK> i e and emotional this conflict <UNK> again in the scene where young is alone playing in <UNK> of the hotel and <UNK> recalls his visit to a <UNK> where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song in his flashback after paying the prostitute <UNK> is clearly physically <UNK> by the consequences of his actions this reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the <UNK> that represents br br ultimately <UNK> is forced to make his biggest decision stay in <UNK> and <UNK> himself to his lust and <UNK> or flee <UNK> to save his own life his early attempt to flee <UNK> at the train station resulted in a <UNK> and <UNK> the outcome of <UNK> his stay br br <UNK> the captivating character interaction <UNK> powerful scenery especially of <UNK> at dawn and the final scene of walking into the water and pointing to the horizon <UNK> this film a true masterpiece
<START> i gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10 it had an excellent plot and peter <UNK> and <UNK> lee as well as the rest of the cast did their parts well br br both peter and <UNK> were too long in the tooth for the ages their characters were supposed to be and their children in the film obviously would have been better suited being their <UNK> br br i missed the first ten minutes of this film so i don't know just how that body turned up after 25 years and got <UNK> back to <UNK> <UNK> peter character but i had no difficulty picking up on the storyline br br barbara <UNK> <UNK> lee is stunned when her long time husband <UNK> is arrested for a murder in <UNK> some 25 years previous a state <UNK> claims he was never in br br however as evidence <UNK> up against <UNK> his story changes then his story changes again and yet again until barbara doesn't know what to believe br br barbara makes up her mind however to get to the bottom of the mystery <UNK> around the <UNK> time <UNK> and a young girl named <UNK> accepted a ride from a stranger named wayne kennedy that ended in murder br br i found the film entertaining well paced and it kept me guessing as to what had really happened between those three people br br from what i saw during the closing credits this seemed to be based on a true story
<START> i saw this movie on television as and loved it i heard an interesting story about this film when roger corman released it to drive ins in the summer of 1981 his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film it was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster during the film's opening at drive <UNK> <UNK> customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see theater owners called corman and said their customers felt ripped off so corman had to run off copies of the footage and send the positive film to theater owners to <UNK> into the film themselves since the footage was never part of the film negative it has not appeared in any video dvd or television broadcast has anyone ever seen this footage anyone who saw this film at a drive in in the summer of 1981 remember this
<START> while it's generally acknowledged one of the first martial arts movies to play here in the west it's real impact comes in retrospect lo <UNK> is very low key throughout and many of the fight scenes while often <UNK> as innovative which they were at the time of the movie's initial release are a tad tame compared to what came after particularly after bruce lee who became the instant standard by which all others will <UNK> be judged that's not to say that five fingers of death king boxer is anything less than a classic in its own right because it is like many of the leading characters in many martial arts movies the character <UNK> plays lays low through most of the movie for a reason but when he cuts loose he effectively <UNK> house you can't ask for more than that
<START> i would like to know if the <UNK> australian tv series will ever be released on dvd sometime in the future and is the music title theme available on cd br br there was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total br br the young german actor in the series was also in a german tv series called black forest clinic which aired here in the uk with english dialogue <UNK> with the lip sync br br i look forward to hearing any comments from tv industry <UNK> on the above questions thank you in advance
<START> <UNK> is a great movie <UNK> plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is <UNK> <UNK> little does <UNK> know in the film that <UNK> has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls never in my life will i forget the line i love you k k k <UNK> br br it's just too bad that <UNK> and <UNK> weren't exactly together in the film but <UNK> and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie though <UNK> role was pretty psychotic i still think he did a great job of playing it and can't possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an award for <UNK> in br br <UNK> what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film it's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other films but <UNK> did give the public a wonderful image of her br br as for the music it was excellent especially <UNK> one of my all time favorite songs i also thought <UNK> mere was quite nice also br br a must see for everyone overall <UNK> deserves a 9 10
<START> i enjoyed <UNK> man push <UNK> and this film is equally good this slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived br br <UNK> and <UNK> do an excellent job as a 12 year old brother and a 16 year old sister who live in a small room over an auto shop there are no parents they are on their own surviving ali <UNK> his <UNK> by stealing auto parts selling <UNK> dvds and selling candy on the subway <UNK> her <UNK> working a food truck by selling herself they are trying to make money to but their own truck br br one is tempted to express outrage at the fact that these two children are left to <UNK> on their own and certainly one can be very upset that sells her body to willing <UNK> but the fact is that this exists today in the world's <UNK> country not some underdeveloped land save the outrage and do something
<START> this really is a great movie i don't think it has ever gotten the recognition that it deserves i have bought this movie on vhs and dvd the special effects were ahead of its time the story was way cool the pace was very steady if you haven't seen it you definitely need to check it out on dvd if possible
<START> if you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future go on and watch the movie 6 10 it is a nice fantasy movie with well done cgi nice acting a beautiful environment and an above average fantasy story br br if you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it don't expect too much or better don't expect anything at all the story is totally different from the original book this may explain that the movie is voted 1 10 from people around 40 or more like me and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing br br most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting in my opinion much to the worse br br the magic in the book works with <UNK> for classic magical effects changing weather creating <UNK> <UNK> into animals in the movie the magic is more like jedi school for the middle ages <UNK> wooden sticks instead of <UNK> that the devil is looking like emperor <UNK> after part iii doesn't make it really better br br the mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie in the book the story is set near <UNK> which visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby <UNK> for <UNK> this part might have been changed to cut costs i also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains br br the whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style lots of mud everywhere dirty faces not an <UNK> kitchen only very rough houses the book never suggested such an environment br br in the book the master tries to make his <UNK> but rejects is somewhere between admiration distance and silent <UNK> in the movie rejects the master always openly like a stubborn <UNK> br br the movie is set in instead of around this makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around ok the stories are missing anyway in the movie br br also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes br br in the book all work done at day is <UNK> and work in the night is like normal work this explanation is missing in the movie sometimes the boys are <UNK> and sometimes they are happy br br the book explains why only a few try to confront the master if the master dies by any mundane reasons the are free and keep their magical powers if the master dies at the confrontation all will lose their power forever
<START> apparently a b movie b must stand for better acting and a better message than we get in big budget a pictures today modern day movies aimed at young women surely aren't designed to encourage depth of character over shallow self serving behavior or increase the self <UNK> of young girls who don't <UNK> to feminine standards after all <UNK> the fake and flashy like this movie does ain't gonna help sell more products that depend on girls not being satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty br br <UNK> day is lovable as a <UNK> inclined <UNK> who <UNK> into rooms and <UNK> to an inability to <UNK> she bonds with robert <UNK> due to similar interests a shared sense of humour and her honesty loyalty and good friendship which he gradually comes to value over the superficial charms of her selfish <UNK> girl sister who only brings out his own selfish reckless playboy <UNK> br br although <UNK> is <UNK> beautiful as well it's refreshing to see inner beauty <UNK> more and the depiction of true friendship leading to the most fulfilling romantic relationship i wish young girls and guys were getting this kind of down to earth message today br br maybe if hollywood returns to making b movies again with modest budgets and tries to be content with modest <UNK> what am i saying <UNK> the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smaller scale would be like expecting a guy to give up the shallow <UNK> for a sweet girl who really cares about him that's crazy talk br br please somebody <UNK> a time machine already i belong in 1940 br br i'd rate this movie higher but the ending is a bit too abrupt and perhaps lacked sufficient indication of robert change of heart i like the fact that b movies are short snappy not <UNK> self indulgent but this one <UNK> needed more than 70 minutes also found it somewhat unrealistic that a widow and young children would be so <UNK> by a sudden death in their family or be so <UNK> of the one who caused it i mean i guess it's nice but a little more <UNK> or <UNK> would've been only natural maybe a deliberate choice to make this family act lighthearted about their loss to <UNK> the impact of the tragedy and make sure we forgive those involved in the death since it's just a plot device anyway not the real point of the film still strange though
<START> alleged scream queen debbie <UNK> and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of ex <UNK> <UNK> attempting to <UNK> the south through pointless massacre br br action and suspense take a <UNK> to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character development br br billy <UNK> is good in the <UNK> not to mention pointless role of the town <UNK> but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor including the town and the <UNK> both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at party city br br do yourself a big favor and watch <UNK> instead
<START> i love cheesy horror movies i think dead alive and bad taste are great and i think <UNK> party massacre ii not even related to this movie are hilarious but this movie absolutely <UNK> i didn't laugh i didn't even enjoy it you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy the best take of the scene where the woman <UNK> out the window is the one where she <UNK> her head on the <UNK> give me a break br br don't rent this thinking it's related to the <UNK> party massacre series it's awful and i don't even have a clue how it got any distribution rent it with a fake name and burn it do everyone else the favor
<START> i'm an action movie fan but until today i've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in italy so i went to see the long kiss <UNK> on pay tv hoping for nothing special br br but what a surprise this movie is great the only problem i found is the presence of some holes in the plot but the rest is the most entertaining intriguing and funny action movie ever made br br the transformation of samantha <UNK> from ordinary wife teacher to cool blooded agent recovering from <UNK> seems to be a good idea the action scenes and the stunts are the best i've ever seen samuel l jackson adds some of the best lines i have ever heard and his chemistry with <UNK> davis is good br br and what about <UNK> she is wonderful she plays the best action heroine ever seen and does strong convincing acting and fantastic stunts br br so i think this movie had weak performances at box office and bad critics because most reviewers and some kind of public have a hard time with strong female lead roles br br 9 10
<START> this movie is extremely funny and it also contains the best looking girl this young man has ever seen <UNK> <UNK> is a great actress and she has the looks that stop traffic <UNK> <UNK> this movie which contains funny scenes put on by shore
<START> this movie is very silly and very funny you can't ever criticize it for taking itself seriously if you've heard their previous album or seen their hbo videos from the album you can imagine the extremely foul mouthed <UNK> good time that is this movie which tells the fable of how the group <UNK> d came to be formed br br full of cameos it not only gives a fictional account of <UNK> d but is a send up of musical history as well the humor reminds one of something about mary in that they often go places you'd thought they wouldn't but it lacks the <UNK> humor of south park this movie contains no nudity except for <UNK>
<START> i have not watched every jackass episode it was mildly entertaining if nothing else was going but after watching jackass 2 i was fond of <UNK> and <UNK> they had a nice attitude in the movie jackass so i figured i'd tune in on <UNK> la <UNK> boy was i mistaken seriously you could pair a bunch of provide them with the same budget and i bet they could knock off something more creative on the screen i mean c'mon mtv at 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish br br everything seems so forced you don't know the characters because there's no attitude at all you can't appreciate <UNK> or <UNK> or anyone for that matter if there would just be a tiny tiny <UNK> of thought anything we won't forget as soon as next shot goes on br br they finally manage to create a good shot and you like whats going on you sit there just waiting for their reaction and then some jerk <UNK> the scenes with two lame sentences and bang was that the close for that shot or what please if i had been there i would freak out and laugh do some insane stuff and have my <UNK> <UNK> but these guys just scripted stupid reactions br br yes they get a few chuckles of the audience by cheap gross jokes or gigantic jokes which in my opinion are such a waste of cash br br many many normal humans which was not taken under the jackass wing could in a <UNK> write a far funnier script or impress with visual camera work even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script would pull of a better job mtv could in a <UNK> bring more <UNK> material on the screen you just need to fire the writer of this stupid show br br some scenes actually require a bit of courage and therefore 2 stars
<START> the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film was the question could mike myers have played a normal dramatic character well he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that i can say about this film in the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that <UNK> meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama and the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot one preposterous story line turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen i suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that's a really bad sign the characters are not much better than a story despite all his troubles young mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him it doesn't work the same thing with other characters they are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character although he wasn't the main character as the only bright spot towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that <UNK> and absurdity unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions and i'm sure he had in the film they are hidden and practically under such a weird script br br grade 3 out of 10 those of you who are interested in seeing mike myers as a drama actor can watch <UNK> meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be <UNK> disappointed
<START> love is hard to find in this fast food society that we live in so man called <UNK> makes it duty to help men find love with women that they are beyond <UNK> in love with his rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex which seems like a great deal but soon word begins to spread around and people begin to get the wrong idea about what he does which begins to <UNK> the relationship with woman he just met that he is <UNK> in love with br br i have to say it's really nice to see will smith in a movie that doesn't have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots there are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his <UNK> up body he's just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice he doesn't necessarily stretch his acting <UNK> in this movie but then again the story doesn't call for that but all the same it was nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his ripped body to make those of us without six packs jealous his character here is as with all his characters likable witty and very charming which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love tale seem to share the kevin james character is just a regular guy that needs help <UNK> up with the girl of his dreams which really makes you feel for the guy and root for him every step of the way the only character that was a sore spot for me was the <UNK> character because she's so cold and <UNK> that it's hard to believe that smith could fall for her he must love a challenge i guess br br now this is the part of the review in which i'll make a joke about how i would never need <UNK> because i'm such a player but i just got through writing about 16 reviews for another web site plus i'm still working on a little project so i'm a little jaded right now <UNK> the movie is packed with enough charm and likable characters with funny lines it slowly but surely falls into the sea of formulaic romantic movies in which after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before but hey there's like <UNK> movies about the underdog <UNK> <UNK> so i guess one more movie having a predictable ending that's been done to almost death doesn't cause much harm i really like the message of the movie as well because in the end you don't need a formula to get the right girl just be yourself and all will fall into play which is theme of the movie and why it works so well i'm sure if it had turned out that the james character gets the girl after following everything that the smith character said then it would have being a pretty empty movie but as it stands it works really well br br despite being predictable this is a perfect date movie it's sweet it's funny and it's romantic so anyone that watches this movie on a date should be getting some after it's over and by some i mean sex
<START> it doesn't happen very often but occasionally one man can make a difference a big difference br br george 2003 best <UNK> charlie <UNK> war is a fascinating and eye opening account of the most unlikely difference maker imaginable a relatively obscure <UNK> from the second district of texas good time charlie was known more for his <UNK> lifestyle than his <UNK> <UNK> likable and <UNK> even for a politician charlie wilson served his well since the good folks of only really wanted two things their guns and to be left alone it's easy street <UNK> with his <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> known appropriately enough as charlie's angels br br when asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive young <UNK> his response is a classic you can teach 'em to type but you can't teach 'em to grow tits no argument there br br but even the most <UNK> has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath and for charlie wilson the <UNK> atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to <UNK> his entire political <UNK> toward funding the utter <UNK> defeat of the russian military and possibly to even help <UNK> the end of the cold war as a result fat chance huh br br under the <UNK> direction of mike <UNK> and a smart snappy screenplay by adam charlie <UNK> war is a <UNK> sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind the scene <UNK> of three colorful characters <UNK> charlie's team br br the on screen team is composed of three marvelous actors with four 4 academy awards and nine 9 nominations between them charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in a solid slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years he's aided <UNK> and by <UNK> <UNK> a wealthy <UNK> <UNK> played by the still <UNK> julia roberts hey why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this by all accounts ms roberts looks good and holds her own but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why <UNK> and country is so important to her character maybe the two <UNK> <UNK> usually by her side know but we as an audience never do as for the third member of the team philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as <UNK> a smart street wise i e non <UNK> league graduate cia <UNK> who knows the score both in the <UNK> <UNK> and in <UNK> bedroom br br for the to succeed the most important assistance the u s can provide is the ability to shoot down the <UNK> <UNK> 21 helicopter which rule the <UNK> this takes money lots of money and eventually charlie's team <UNK> <UNK> those in <UNK> to <UNK> the effort to the tune of 1 billion dollars for advanced <UNK> to arm the <UNK> rebels this includes top of the line state of the art anti aircraft and anti tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices nasty nasty stuff br br that this kind of multi billion dollar <UNK> activity can and does take place behind <UNK> doors is truly <UNK> every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business as usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government oh <UNK> i wish it weren't so br br even though the initial outcome for team charlie was an <UNK> success the <UNK> <UNK> final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the <UNK> and others since the funding was entirely <UNK> the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet <UNK> and the end to russian was the direct result of american <UNK> yes once the <UNK> left so did our aid <UNK> for schools <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> on maintaining meaningful relationships with the <UNK> people as a result the overall consequence is an <UNK> disaster it's like the <UNK> to mission accomplished br br as film so <UNK> points out the ball you've set in motion can keep <UNK> even after you've lost interest in it mike knows this eva longoria parker knows this little <UNK> in <UNK> knows this but the typical american politician doesn't so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys talk about a catch 22 another mike <UNK> film br br perhaps charlie wilson said it best we f <UNK> up the end game br br again
<START> i made it about 8 minutes into steel frontier before i turned it off then <UNK> for punishment that i am i watched some more the next day today i had to iron a pile of clothes so i decided to finish the movie and that was its own punishment here's what i don't understand robert rodriguez and <UNK> each spent 7 000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money and they <UNK> out a huge steaming pile of crap let me see if i can figure out the logic it's <UNK> but it's like a future western we'll get the <UNK> <UNK> we can find we'll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script and we'll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions we can't lose br br seriously i don't think even the mst3k guys could improve this but if you insist on watching it i recommend getting very drunk first
<START> my girlfriend as we walk in the cold london evening in <UNK> square after the movie says if they didn't speak english and they didn't show the stadium you could have thought this was the <UNK> of a south american city or some other <UNK> anywhere in the world not queens in nyc br br <UNK> is right now my official hero because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the other face of american but the real face of america br br <UNK> movies are like <UNK> or <UNK> zero or <UNK> <UNK> chop shop is reality turned into a movie is more realistic than a documentary in fact i think <UNK> movies are more realistic than documentaries this is a great movies but don't expect any car chase or shooting this movie is about tragic lives on the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> country in the world
<START> jerry lewis was <UNK> funny when he didn't write his own material and had a good director like frank <UNK> when he started writing and directing his own films what little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his <UNK> whenever his films would fail and deservedly so in the american market they made money in france lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself for example he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was according to lewis released on a double bill with the porno feature deep throat if anyone should have complained about that situation it should have been the producers of deep throat this is an absolutely idiotic comedy about the world's <UNK> man lewis who is rejected for military service during ww2 and decides to outfit a special squad to go to germany and capture hitler himself besides the many faults this film has the script is mind numbingly unfunny <UNK> direction is nonexistent the film has the look of a cheap home movie lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with no talent over the hill <UNK> belt comics like jan murray and sidney miller was a good idea he must have figured that they would be so bad they would make him look good he was half right they are embarrassingly bad but he comes out even worse than they do for a comedy <UNK> character is <UNK> angry and <UNK> the way he <UNK> abuse on his <UNK> makes you wonder why they would ever follow a bullying jerk like this on a dangerous mission like trying to capture hitler the fact that this movie took in any money at all is astounding it is by far the worst jerry lewis movie i have ever seen i've heard that slapstick is even more pathetic but i can't bring myself to see if that's true or not and is to be avoided at all possible costs
<START> times i look back to high school and it <UNK> me that i never went lower than marvin did in this bad film br br poor <UNK> is the main character who's bad luck just gets worse and worse despite his intelligence he manages to get <UNK> exploited supports his lousy <UNK> dad and plenty more goof ups including a daring heist which let's say doesn't go fully to plan of course the viewer feels no empathy with anyone in this film so all this disastrous <UNK> <UNK> off like harmless zeta <UNK> recommended for those days you're feeling down pop this film in and you'll smile and say i'm so glad i'm not <UNK>
<START> i have just sat through this film again and can only wonder if we will see the likes of films like this anymore the timeless music the tender voices of william <UNK> and jennifer jones leave this grown man <UNK> through <UNK> romantic scenes and i'm not one who cries very often in life where have our william <UNK> gone and will they make these moving wonderful movies any more it's sad to have to realize that they probably won't but don't think about it just try to block that out of your mind even so they won't have <UNK> in it and he won't appear on that hill just once more either you can only enjoy this film and watch it again
<START> this is the worst exercise in middle class <UNK> yet to hit our television screens i unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel and i'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive i love having been a big fan of both black books and green wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts however she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided please <UNK> bear in mind that the <UNK> <UNK> act may well be <UNK> if you continue to bill as comedy material which is at best pseudo psychological <UNK> and at worst a drama which poses as a quirky comedy to hide the fact that is neither fish nor <UNK>
<START> i would say to the foreign people who have seen this movie and who did not understand it that it is normal because it was based on massive plays on words a person not knowing about the french cultural funny references in this film could not follow all the subtleties the movie has been a huge success in france and all the actors are well renowned here
<START> wait until you've watched most of all other films ever released wait a year then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge <UNK> imagination br br i agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten star production has to be doing it to <UNK> the data anything above 8 would be odd br br nice to see the very young sandy <UNK> in her hair for the short time she was featured though she <UNK> the new <UNK> accent but other times her southern virginia <UNK> accent did sneak through ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film br br the dvd i rented had two bonus features a mini bio section that only featured <UNK> bio taken <UNK> from imdb it also had a trivia <UNK> as a bonus 3 questions hope you get them all right
<START> i should explain that as far as this trend goes for ripping off asian horror movies this <UNK> is a head above the grudge and dark water while still not achieving the same amount of atmospheric creepiness that the ring <UNK> br br still though movies like life don't exist in a <UNK> and are therefore up for comparison to other suspense thriller horror movies honestly i'm not writing a lengthy synopsis here and will say that this movie attempts to rely on music induced <UNK> scares rather than atmosphere and the ghost itself really isn't that remarkable the plot is pretty basic and predictable and isn't anything to write home about either while there are a few suspenseful scenes that border on <UNK> scary most of the movie is pretty vanilla if you enjoyed the grudge and it's <UNK> then you might enjoy this br br grade c
<START> this is a well crafted piece from everyone's favorite master of suspense as usual the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding especially for the film's time i did not find the first part of the film very exciting but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another br br the only thing i did not like about this movie was the choice of <UNK> granger for the part of guy haines somehow i didn't find him very believable on the other hand robert walker shines as sinister <UNK> <UNK> bruno anthony br br overall i would highly recommend this
<START> in a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's leon the leader of the <UNK> starts the gang after his brother <UNK> on junk he <UNK> to protect the neighborhood the leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge br br the movie didn't really do it for me the good guys weren't any more good than the bad guys very little was shown to suggest that the <UNK> really cared for the community i suppose the writers were going for realism here but i just didn't care which side won none of the characters were likable or even capable of drawing my sympathy br br on the plus side the <UNK> between annie and bobby had some snappy dialog and the acting overall was well done
<START> wow i watched one night at yesterday and all i can say is wow br br here i go major spoilers br br would you like a summary of the plot just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is i would never tell anybody to watch it unless i was out to <UNK> pain upon them anyway here's a glimpse or a huge <UNK> of the plot br br randy works for a bar he meets up with this woman named jewel who convinces him to surprisingly have sex with him her ex boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and gets killed randy and his cousin and the detective at the scene of the crime all fall for jewel she being the <UNK> of stupidity uses every one of these guys to get what she wants involving a dvd player randy hires a hit man to kill her and eventually the detective is killed by the ex <UNK> psycho brother and the hit man and jewel take off br br seriously that's it i left hardly anything out except for a few more sex scenes and a nearly pornographic scene of <UNK> tyler as jewel using a <UNK> to <UNK> her sexuality br br what was the point of this movie to be honest i think it was so that the producers and directors could show off their male <UNK> which i think is absolutely <UNK> for and just plain stupid when i watch a movie i want a plot i want characters i don't care about sexy woman <UNK> anything they might have something should happen in a movie for <UNK> sake this is as bad as fight club br br it gets even worse john goodman is the detective devoted to the higher being i myself wondered why goodman would play in something so outrageously pitiful as this but then i remembered that he was in o brother where art <UNK> as well his reputation just went down a notch br br <UNK> tyler was an amazing actress in the lord of the rings series in this movie she is nothing more than an <UNK> slut who wants nothing but her way her reputation has gone down seven or eight <UNK> to me br br i am amazed simply amazed that people would work so hard to make something so stupid the music is absolutely crappy having <UNK> play while john <UNK> character is being killed doesn't really fit the characters are totally unlikeable the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man and to top it off it doesn't even fit into any genre the closest it gets to is pornographic comedy if it was even supposed to be funny which it wasn't br br i think i'm done <UNK> now but let me just assure you that nobody in their right mind would ever ever want to see this movie unless they lust for <UNK> tyler as much as the characters do that is
<START> this is one entertaining flick i suggest you rent it buy a couple of <UNK> and invite the whole crew over for this one my favorite parts were 1 the <UNK> that were so well choreographed that john woo himself was jealous 2 the wonderful special effects 3 the academy award winning acting and 4 the fact that every single <UNK> in the film seemed to be doing a bad scarface <UNK> i mean master p as a cuban godfather this is groundbreaking territory and with well written dialogue including lines like the only difference between you and me rico is i'm alive and your dead this movie is truly a masterpiece yeah right
<START> the movie is nothing extraordinary as a matter of fact it is an insult to the horror genre nothing about it borders on scary not even close to the <UNK> of scary br br it's just another case of another teenage horror movie seen one and you've seen em all first few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next the worst part is the script is than the most recent installment of scary movie would have been better if it's written in spanish and don't get me started with the inside jokes and <UNK> br br though i will give a little credit for the special effects but trust me like any other hollywood made horror movie and special effects has little or no effect to a horror movie's ability to scare in fact it makes it worse br br between the fresh faced anita and the spooky location there's not much to see in this movie
<START> another tiresome bore from anthony who seems to <UNK> on these big <UNK> super productions that take over two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes br br the story centers on a jude law who goes off to the civil war having just barely started a sort of romance with nicole kidman a <UNK> daughter who has recently arrived in the <UNK> photographed <UNK> town the story cuts back and forth between trials and <UNK> at war which is guess what boys and girls hell and <UNK> trials and <UNK> back at home which are very predictably incredibly boring <UNK> appears on <UNK> farm to help kidman get it back into shape after <UNK> <UNK> daddy dies of <UNK> character disease acts all <UNK> and <UNK> in that <UNK> <UNK> kind of way <UNK> enough tough love and <UNK> wisdom to turn the stomach of even the <UNK> watcher of touched by an angel br br this film is quite simply excruciating avoid it like the big <UNK> oscar bait bogus pretentious literary adaptation nonsense that it is
<START> some changes for the better the special effects are more elaborate some for the worse scott a likable kid in the original has turned into an awkward teenager but generally this sequel is about on a par with the original which doesn't say much the pg 13 rating is questionable although the film is not scary at all there is some brief but quite explicit gore and some out of place nudity 1 2
<START> a great movie the movie was even better then the commercials put on and believe it or not it was very very inspirational i really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another br br it was kinda corny at the very beginning but quickly picks up i laughed i laughed very hard on some parts the acting is basically above average nothing special but better then average i can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer 1st funniest being <UNK> ii so after all of that i give it a 7 10 a high seven but not quite an eight
<START> against my own better judgment i went to see this film today and god i wish i hadn't awful the first film looks like a classic compared to this it's that bad these guys actually make paul <UNK> anderson look like a master <UNK> in fact this is what i'd expect an alien and or predator film to look like if it was made by uwe boll this movie actually offended me and lord only knows what would <UNK> if <UNK> scott or <UNK> <UNK> were ever forced to watch this piece of crap i can't understand how any fan of either franchise could like this film br br truly i don't know where to begin i mean the first was <UNK> but it at least a semi interesting story and setting and occasionally some genuine tension it didn't take itself overly seriously and it could at least be semi enjoyed on a purely leave your brain at home basis but this one it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece one after the other was a contrived scene in a dark room or <UNK> with creepy music playing essentially bashing you over the head saying be scared now as james cameron once said you can't be told to be scared you can only have your own senses <UNK> the guys that made this film obviously weren't paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared rather than letting you come to that level yourself it's a cliché for internet <UNK> to say god i was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving well this is exactly how i felt even in the middle of the action scenes they took this film totally seriously which removed any possibility of enjoyment even the gag about how <UNK> don't lie to their people was played without a hint of irony br br as for the characters i knew going in that the human characters were going to be completely pointless to this film but seriously if they're going to be on screen at least have them doing something that is relevant to the story i don't care about this guy being beaten up by his boyfriend i don't care about the mother who's own daughter doesn't even know her boo <UNK> a pair of night vision <UNK> for a present give me a break or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother what a guy hell even the obligatory hot chick in <UNK> moment was more contrived than usual i get the feeling they expected the audience to be so shocked at the ending as well as seeing come out of kids <UNK> mothers being raped and the like that that would make up for everything i don't think so br br then we move onto the stars of the film and again very little to write home about were the aliens well designed i wouldn't have a clue because you can never see the damn things all you see is one of a mouth a head a tail or a really dodgy cg outline climbing a wall and barely enough to actually process that it is in fact an alien before mr i cut marilyn <UNK> and <UNK> music videos think i'll do the same thing here editor goes at it with the slice tool also notice how hack action directors always set their films at night and in the rain <UNK> the predator could've been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew yes the predator was more impressive this time around and i did think some of the new <UNK> was cool but that was about it also since when does a predator sound like a dinosaur from the lost world there were a couple of things that i kinda liked though one was the use of sound effects and music from the original films i also <UNK> a little bit at get to the <UNK> although other references were stupid the main character's name being dallas give me a break i also liked the visual fx for the vision as well as how the hybrid alien looked certainly beat the one from <UNK> but really those are the only positive things br br overall i found this movie inane pointless insulting and above all else offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures that they've left the door open for another one leaves me almost depressed br br if they had any decency they'd remove dan ron and <UNK> <UNK> from the credits of this film they've done nothing to deserve this
<START> this film has its <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> may offend some folks who frankly need a good <UNK> upside the head but the film is top notch in every way engaging poignant relevant finney naturally is larger than life <UNK> makes an ideal foil i thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads and character provides plenty of dark humor the period is well captured the supporting cast well chosen this is to be seen and <UNK> like a fine <UNK> i only wish it were out on dvd already sigh
<START> <UNK> is one of the most realistic depictions of war ever set to film this is not an action film by any means though the pacing is faster and there is most action than in most any other bergman movie nor is this a of war or <UNK> unlike most war movies in fact the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the character's <UNK> has a very contemporary feel br br is a darkly lit movie that should be watched at night so as to let it work it's magic many of the effects are conveyed <UNK> but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity to a contemporary insanely huge budget film like saving private ryan of course the action in is on a much smaller scale but it is impressive none the less br br while the film making style feels contemporary the setting of the film feels timeless and the war torn countryside and even the yet intact <UNK> hamlet could be anywhere any time and this film is not so much about specific historical events with specific names and dates but about universal human reactions to <UNK> and chaos br br the acting in though typically impressive from <UNK> and <UNK> is not of primary importance in this film unlike most other bergman movies through much of the film they are <UNK> much as we are bergman has the war <UNK> on them and through them on the audience and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions might be br br highly recommended 10 10
<START> the comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate i feel exactly the same way that i am very disappointed at how far rick <UNK> has fallen when he used to do some really great things on this hour has 22 minutes but now he is just <UNK> around going places and talking to people he does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all just really sad and predictable jokes about <UNK> most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people for example this week he is going to a <UNK> and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses etc he used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving this hour has 22 minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more now that air farce is off the air finally thank goodness <UNK> and this hour has 22 minutes have got to be next in line for the axe just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more it's sad really considering rick <UNK> used to be the funniest man on canadian tv
<START> i love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great american sitcom i watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job the rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real <UNK> i loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots one who got laid and the other who didn't getting into some form of zany trouble that <UNK> involved their students the british girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass the hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot and the principal and her <UNK> that served to somehow move the almost non existent plot forward i loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young but i ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had did they look like that or did you go to the high school that had middle aged people teaching in it that is the high school that everyone else went to the show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools in public schools principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers the school board does but in every episode that i watched the principal made <UNK> to fire her teachers think back to your history class or think of any history class did you ever see an incredibly hot british chick teach an american history class no did you ever see a <UNK> <UNK> that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in no br br teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality what makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out the <UNK> on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines and i'm sorry i just didn't buy it the show could have <UNK> itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single camera format and it should have centered more around the <UNK> relationships with their students and not with each other br br it gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick she was really hot br br in the end it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a <UNK> attempt to understand a profession i only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen
<START> i watched the movie yesterday and for me it was a stunning combination of movies like pulp fiction and <UNK> dogs the best of the best it was never any dull and always moving every hour there's another character bothering trying to kill him you never know what's next in one word terrific
<START> this is an extraordinary film as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an <UNK> on the american justice system it's frightening for butler the consequences of this system could be devastating this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court in truth the <UNK> of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty or a guilty man being free every citizen has a right to justice whether a <UNK> or a victim but do they get it the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen
<START> this is without a doubt the most hilarious movie i've ever seen seriously if the makers of this movie are ever discovered they'll put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent jack o tonight believe me you won't regret it
<START> an interesting and involved film about a <UNK> just trying to live out his days <UNK> elements of the main character appear in michael <UNK> later films like thief 1981 heat 1995 and so on you can see this one at the <UNK> <UNK> media laboratory one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public it's a great one
<START> when something can be anything you want it to be or mean it's bound to register with someone as being rather special but just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a <UNK> and to another of his <UNK> rear and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the <UNK> interpretation anyone who might find throwing a stuffed <UNK> out of a window brilliant or worthwhile for that matter without relating it in some context is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her <UNK> br br <UNK> to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like and even if we were mad ourselves this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison a love affair with this movie <UNK> the same risk as seriously <UNK> <UNK> whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> of its day and to a <UNK> few radical <UNK> at that i did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity though br br the movie is definitely anti fascist and to some extent anti italian i noted that although the years <UNK> 30 were years of great public works and urban <UNK> in italy any indication of this seemed avoided furthermore avant academic take note of this for your next class the very short <UNK> haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of victor <UNK> iii and his tall female companion none other than queen helen <UNK> princess of <UNK> without an understanding of potential historical relevance even the apparent <UNK> is beyond the <UNK> of academic or other intellectual <UNK> who would in <UNK> to impress us br br i gladly add my own paint <UNK> to the <UNK> of this cinematic joke but in an adaptation of the famous <UNK> by the little boy the movie really has no face to paint would help it burn though
<START> watched this piece <UNK> because the description was kind of outlandish this film stinks of cocaine the opening scene alone must have cost at least five figures in blow to film this is a racist <UNK> piece of garbage that <UNK> along for a good <UNK> and with absolutely no direction i am a little confused on how this has good reviews here i won't bother telling you the plot line because as far as i can tell there is no plot i'm pretty sure everyone showed up to the set everyday did giant lines dressed loretta in <UNK> <UNK> to show as much <UNK> as possible and <UNK> action letting the cast <UNK> in a cocaine frenzy much like real beer this movie nearly caused my <UNK> to fail half way through save your money and watch <UNK> instead
