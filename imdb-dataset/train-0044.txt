<START> paul <UNK> definitely saved the best bourne for last i've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project all i have to say to that is are you kidding me come on it was not that bad at all i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography as for the rest of the movie i really didn't even notice it br br you can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne sometimes that can be a bad thing but in this case its a really good thing he really becomes jason bourne in this installment damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen <UNK> kramer and julia stiles david <UNK> was a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the secret cia organization br br even though the movie is filled with great car chases and <UNK> action they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on this film stands far above the other two bourne movies and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season
<START> this is said to be a personal film for peter <UNK> he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters who are detectives these detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective doesn't it this entire movie was written by peter and it shows how out of touch with real people he was you're supposed to write what you know and he did that indeed and leaves the audience bored and confused and jealous for that matter this is a <UNK> for people who want to see dorothy <UNK> who was murdered right after filming but <UNK> <UNK> who would in real life marry keith richards was also a model like <UNK> but is a lot better and has a more ample part in fact <UNK> part seemed forced added she doesn't have a lot to do with the story which is pretty convoluted to begin with all in all every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with unless you're millionaire from manhattan with beautiful <UNK> at your <UNK> call for the rest of us it's an irritating <UNK> fest that's what happens when you're out of touch you entertain your few friends with inside jokes and bore all the rest
<START> in director eric <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused the first victim is forced to eat his own crap before being <UNK> to death the next bloke ends up with a bullet in the <UNK> after <UNK> to have <UNK> sex with the first guy's corpse but it's the third man who gets it the worst he has to watch the heavily <UNK> <UNK> emily <UNK> get naked and <UNK> with a <UNK> handle oh he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too br br and unfortunately so do we get to see her <UNK> that <UNK> get a <UNK> handle up our <UNK> br br yes <UNK> <UNK> is one harsh viewing experience not because of its relentless violence but because <UNK> who is obviously under the misguided notion that she has the body of a <UNK> as opposed to that of a <UNK> for <UNK> constantly gets buck naked for the camera it ain't a pretty sight br br in addition to the non stop nudity from an <UNK> up <UNK> viewers also get to see dreadful direction from <UNK> who thinks that endless shots of <UNK> and trees is entertaining stuff some really bad acting and a fat guy's penis br br strangely enough i give <UNK> <UNK> a rating of 3 10 which is actually slightly higher than its current 2 9 average that's one point for the messy axe attack which being a gore <UNK> i actually enjoyed one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> hilarious and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to <UNK> <UNK> superior exploitation classic i spit on your grave
<START> michael keaton has really never been a good actor in the tim burton batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains here he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio <UNK> that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living br br well this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you because there's way too much stuff that ends up unexplained <UNK> and uninteresting so where's the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that white noise makes a fool out of itself truly bad acting and horrifying edited this movie is nothing to watch michael keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever
<START> this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever i emphasize ever made <UNK> worse my old hero dolph is in it and <UNK> starring it jesus the story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two <UNK> <UNK> it out in the <UNK> the actors except for dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you <UNK> help but wonder if their reason for being there is that <UNK> all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time this is <UNK> million spent in an <UNK> way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost <UNK> be a <UNK> above <UNK>
<START> i do agree that though this story by <UNK> just might be <UNK> this isn't even a credible try to move the story into the 20th century just <UNK> the original story's intent and nature possibly you might have been able to move it over to england but it must be a period piece even our story narrator the <UNK> tells it in a flashback going back even further somewhere around <UNK> towards the end of the 19th century a strangely <UNK> worker would be <UNK> without a thought and the 20th century come on give me an <UNK> deleted break even around <UNK> such behavior didn't work very well in view of the ending and the movie's ending i don't know what it was because i didn't watch the entire travesty i had to stop this was like setting <UNK> named desire in <UNK> england
<START> my giving this a score of 3 is not what i would give the original soviet version of this film it seems that american international a studio that <UNK> in ultra low budget fare in the 60s bought this film and utterly destroyed it <UNK> a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film plus much of this 64 minutes was new material such as the monsters so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original the original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the soviet conquest of space though i really am not sure what it was originally for insight into the original film read steven <UNK> review it was very helpful br br by the way this was the third soviet sci film i've seen that american international bought and then <UNK> apart to make a new film standard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buck provided of course it didn't cost them much more than a buck in the first place this <UNK> film was about two rival world powers not the us and <UNK> trying to be the first to mars the <UNK> bad guys try but fail and the good guys rescue one of the idiot <UNK> and then head to mars unfortunately they are <UNK> stranded on a moon of mars where they see some monsters added by american international that are <UNK> cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a <UNK> <UNK> then they are rescued returning to earth heroes br br the bottom line is that the film was butchered turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art for the time being turned into a grade c movie because of this the <UNK> really had a reason to hate america i'm just shocked that the horrible job a i did with this film didn't convince them to refuse to sell more films to these <UNK> it's worth a look for a laugh but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between so the film is a dud not bad enough to make it a must see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously i would really love to see this movie in its original form it must have been some picture
<START> great great great that is all i can say about that movie but imdb want at least four lines of text so i'll elaborate the cast was great jerry <UNK> is <UNK> cute the music was great the sixties had the best music ever imho the historical material was interesting and so was the way they made the actors of the <UNK> seem like they were actually there in the '60s and most of all the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes and that is the greatness of any drama but in one word great
<START> its a shame she didn't get screen credit she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross best part of the movie she had much more impact than <UNK> or just about anyone else in the film she almost made s m look like fun she really was believable has the s m model that gets scared of her situation although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy those sets were very well built but they just sort of <UNK> the surface of what was shot this is one film were both cuts should be made available it seems they left out a lot of what was shot and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming what was shot would not have gotten a r rating probably a <UNK> 17 or x but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been
<START> one piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business br br at the time in 1994 this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history and may continue to hold it was held in <UNK> <UNK> no doubt in honor of the original film's angels who haunted the <UNK> pirates in this remake they haunt the california angels br br anyway the premiere was held at the long gone three rivers stadium which was the home of the <UNK> pirates and the <UNK> <UNK> at the time the pirates are now <UNK> in <UNK> park and the <UNK> at <UNK> field the premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held and may even continue to hold the record for the largest movie premiere in history shown to 60 000 fans danny glover tony <UNK> and christopher lloyd were all in <UNK> to the admiration of thousands of sports fans
<START> autobiography of <UNK> of <UNK> in nyc starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there however we get more and more involved with reality as gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily <UNK> to his mother's wishes this might scare younger children <UNK> scenes where buddy tries to <UNK> <UNK> rather quick resolution at the end below average
<START> all i can say after watching <UNK> is please stop mr <UNK> it is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about if you insist on making movies about gangsters i urge you to do research it's comical to watch movies with absurd <UNK> that even sound more absurd when they speak br br i laughed at the part when mr <UNK> goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their <UNK> in kung fu fashion this movie was tough as an after school special who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular <UNK> was from i suspect real <UNK> do not wear hats claiming there gang that would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related br br <UNK> is the worst <UNK> movie ever made
<START> following their daughter's brutal murder julie and allen escape the city to find <UNK> and <UNK> in a <UNK> cabin on a remote mountain allen's intentions are good he wants his wife to get out of her depression by <UNK> her photography julie stumbles across an ancient prison and sees the perfect creepy <UNK> setting for her photography but when the photos are developed they are full of dead people and allen quickly discovers the tragic history of suicide in their new mountain dark remains is a pretty decent indie horror flick it offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension the acting is fairly good and the cinematography is great 7 out of 10
<START> at first sight who's singing over there just seems to be an absurd and excellent <UNK> with only a kind of unusual quiet and slow motion what a mistake br br beginning with two singers on a desert landscape then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors it hides a gem br br the <UNK> story and a false rhythm <UNK> you to think yes it is comic but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie br br not at all very funny by instant dark subtle cynical on others its development surprises you all along the <UNK> very <UNK> and cleverly presented all the characters are important and the actors give them full life br br and what is astonishing it's based on deep observation great <UNK> of the camera work and has a great meanings and really everything the general direction and how also the details are presented that it simply makes you forget it's a movie it is like to watch a kind human society you yet don't know shot by a friend behind a camera br br and you're the one behind him it is simple and simply exceptional br br don't <UNK> me in no way that would means the script the quality of picture the music score have a kind of amateurish way no no it's great art br br because it flows like a <UNK> from high up in the mountain down to the sea with all the different sort of grounds and <UNK> that a real river will face on its journey to the <UNK> from a tiny thing to a main stream br br this <UNK> image i used is the very best way i can find to explain all the charm that has who's singing over there for me again i take the hammer simply exceptional br br i've seen that the director is the one who made chat <UNK> chat noir which i know is quiet <UNK> but as i yet didn't see it i had no idea about this gentleman br br others reviewers wrote <UNK> comments on that film i fully agree br br european eastern cinema is not well know because seldom translated but i am lucky to have this <UNK> one in original language with good english subtitles all in all deep delicious and exceptional br br for fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs avoid it at any cost it may be too subtle and good for you br br but if you're interested in different genres and or classics i guess you won't regret this one and in case of buying it will have good <UNK> in your personal dvd library with such no less than <UNK> big names like billy wilder lubitsch or <UNK> <UNK> among some of my preferred directors at least for this movie br br a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet orson welles
<START> one of the <UNK> movies of the 1940s an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay <UNK> <UNK> orchestra leader and radio star and eternal college <UNK> goof off was sort of the <UNK> to spike jones <UNK> it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry <UNK> of musicians he's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion the kind where poison <UNK> <UNK> from africa are framed and hung on the wall the <UNK> is <UNK> with a creepy judge a scary professor an ominous <UNK> lots of <UNK> females and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures the songs by jimmy <UNK> and johnny <UNK> are nothing to <UNK> out and neither is over confident <UNK> <UNK> it up with <UNK> in the <UNK> material that turns 1940 back ten years from
<START> this movie is excellent i found it very interesting i thought the wendigo legend was pretty cool the acting was also great as well as the costumes production photography directing and script br br a very happy family on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer a <UNK> then appears and is very angry and <UNK> over the fact that one of the <UNK> <UNK> is broken he then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them br br see this movie it's worth it kudos to the cast crew and filmmakers two thumbs way up
<START> i was an <UNK> in an old theater in northern california when this movie came out as good as it is on dvd it's even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen although it has been about 9 years since i have seen it it is still one of my all time favorites at the risk of sounding trite they just don't make 'em like this anymore if sixth sense freaked you out at all this movie is definitely for you great storyline incredible cast of characters ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it i highly recommend you not watch it alone what a <UNK> apartment was renting for in 1977 alone will have you <UNK> it would be at least 10 times that price today
<START> as a former <UNK> this was one of the worst submarine movies i have ever seen first of all a <UNK> aboard any us naval <UNK> particularly a nuclear powered <UNK> submarine in <UNK> these men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission the responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the captain to the most junior crew member i could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the captain and the executive officer an executive officer who acted as the character played by denzel washington did would be <UNK> of his duties and court <UNK> then <UNK> from the navy it is no surprise the navy refused to send a technical <UNK> to help in making this film lastly if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made <UNK> on this <UNK> they would be severely <UNK> <UNK> learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid <UNK> they don't slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft <UNK> shoes when <UNK> i was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while <UNK> loud music would never be <UNK> i know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous i would not recommend this movie to anyone
<START> scary movie 2 was a grave disappointment simply <UNK> movies like mission impossible 2 does not lead to comedy the movie opens well enough with a funny white people <UNK> scene and an excellent use of james woods <UNK> andy <UNK> the movie <UNK> from there unfortunately the acting is awful <UNK> spelling looks and acts completely out of place the movie looks <UNK> together and is surprisingly slow paced some of the longer gags in this <UNK> paced movie involving <UNK> and a previously mentioned tom cruise movie <UNK> funny to anyone in my theater the movie thankfully comes <UNK> to a halt at <UNK> minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending i say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor i dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make <UNK> some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers overall a very poorly done movie
<START> purple rain is so cool for the dad we are tracking <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> hudson <UNK> <UNK> to ride a motorcycle take a ride with franklin <UNK> in the <UNK> let's go back to 1984 it was a movie released and prince <UNK> into stardom you would think hudson <UNK> will be a superstar for his new movie in 20th century fox movie called <UNK> purple rain starring hudson <UNK> voiced by dan green who played <UNK> dad the pokemon gym leader 9 tracks tina <UNK> private dancer and billy <UNK> suddenly was headed for the album as prince held more <UNK> it is time we've pulled the plug on the 1984 movies our 20th century fox fans are not watching anymore the kid yells out look out for the deer is such a danger in mind ralph <UNK> will be <UNK> and <UNK> the new movie called <UNK> purple rain released on video tom cruise jumps into his motorcycle brad pitt jumps into his motorcycle and hudson <UNK> jumps into his motorcycle thanks to bette midler from <UNK> and the <UNK> you are <UNK> the heroic <UNK> hudson bart is writing i shall not watch purple rain on the <UNK> go on the <UNK> ferry bridge and enjoy the kid's <UNK> hudson <UNK> is watching you
<START> i liked the film some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it a very tense action scene that seemed well done br br some of the <UNK> scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time <UNK> photography unusual colors or interesting angles also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too i'd give the film an 8 out of 10
<START> this film is a great fun i recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends i did last night and it was fascinating how well norma <UNK> could pull everybody into her world i did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as i did the first time but they all <UNK> me and loved the movie you know it is a great film if you spend 2 hours after the film talking about the movie br br i once saw a con man almost up <UNK> <UNK> level but no where near the same size ring he <UNK> of very <UNK> and rich folks at my old berkeley <UNK> a a group where everyone <UNK> everyone else he would <UNK> only people who seemed very well to do who knew he would have stolen in excess of <UNK> in 1987 when that was real money after being in town for only 1 month his victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face br br the above crime is nothing compared to what norma <UNK> did to her old neighbor but i don't want to give anything away br br i just found this one night on a late night movie channel <UNK> i think this is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally tricked into seeing something and having your mind blown just drag your friends over to see this and don't tell them a thing it is a very entertaining film it moves quickly and never <UNK> you br br this should be a international classic for all time i believe all great movies eventually rise to the top time will be very good to this film i am just sorry no one has heard of it yet in some ways that makes the surprises even better br br the director and editor were fantastic they deserved winning the best documentary br br just watch this film
<START> the only redemption was the small part by larry miller it seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be something about mary but i didn't even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards the actor who plays paul was great but <UNK> blair is stuck in the stupidity of her cruel intentions character james <UNK> was great but paul's father seemed like he was trying too hard to be the randy quaid character from the national <UNK> vacation movies
<START> the idea is to have something interesting happening in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked late night shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer than that when we do get to a point it is so <UNK> moronic that i kept thinking i must have misunderstood it but i didn't br br sean tells the story of an <UNK> <UNK> who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked different shifts and so didn't realise they were sharing his friend asks but what about the <UNK> sean doesn't have an adequate explanation sean then tells the story of his own similar problem which is that he isn't sure his girlfriend is still living at home as he works during the night and she works during the day so they never see each other this has been going on for three weeks but his friend doesn't ask yes but as i said before what about the <UNK> you must see her then it doesn't make sense what are you going on about sean are you on <UNK> or something but let's be generous and assume that they both work seven days a week br br we see sean checking to see if the soap and <UNK> have been used in fact <UNK> he starts to carry the soap around with him but what about his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> let's go to the kitchen what about food and drink is any missing has any been bought in the bedroom has the shared bed been made or not are her clothes being used and <UNK> for clean ones is the <UNK> basket fuller in the toilet is the seat up or down i mean good grief br br and to cap it all paul <UNK> to leave work early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home why doesn't he just phone her br br but it gets worse in the last act although no one told vincent where the rest of the group are going he manages to find them <UNK> love interest and <UNK> girlfriend conveniently appear to be best friends and also manage to find the group there isn't even the slightest attempt to explain any of these extraordinarily unlikely <UNK> br br to be fair the dialogue is ok but not nearly good enough to make up for the weak characters or annoyingly lame story br br i heard one of actors interviewed and he promised no guns no drugs no <UNK> i thought great but after half an hour of tedium i was yelling at the screen i want guns i want drugs i want <UNK> br br it wouldn't have taken much to sort these problems out but on the official website the director boasts that the film wasn't script edited that's all you need to know
<START> this is not a good movie it's disjointed all the acting is bad and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better else where not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away worst of all no one bothered to tell <UNK> <UNK> she can't sing but who cares she's <UNK> damn good looking but i <UNK> nothing new here bottom line hot girl group gets taken advantage of some one gets hooked on drugs someone gets hooked on a guy some one gets the hell out and then the horrible stuff happens surprise surprise welcome to the music business i can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie so many of you seem to want to use a <UNK> scale when it comes to <UNK> black movies i don't play that if you want to support these films by going to see them great if you enjoyed it super to each his own but don't try to tell me it was good <UNK> i wish colored folks would not <UNK> over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors wanna see a good african american movie see love jones ray or the color purple those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin why because they told compelling stories with great acting that made you feel something long after you left the theater just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film it's only good when it's good period
<START> a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual <UNK> of the dead end kids as a matter of fact with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces at least for <UNK> sake br br speaking of ann sheridan she is the one true shining light of this movie to <UNK> a cliché ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd br br another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan unfortunately this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background for a better example of the sheridan reagan duo i would recommend <UNK> girl or kings row
<START> it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any gray matters will agree that this movie just doesn't work br br the problems lay in the direction cast <UNK> and lack of depth in the character building the word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used let's look at the problems in direction script br br brother and sister both in their mid 30's seem to be well <UNK> they meet a complete stranger at a park and heather graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer he then <UNK> walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him then after one date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in vegas in a <UNK> time hello does anyone feel stupid yet he goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that we see on the screen and he wants to marry her not only was there no chemistry it just doesn't make sense sure it's a romantic comedy and i want to believe it could but the direction made it completely flat br br now heather falls head over heels with her too and when heather graham and bridget <UNK> very shallow character kiss or more to the point it was <UNK> kiss ever that chemistry might be there i found it <UNK> and unfunny and while many say heather cannot act i think the reality is heather was clearly the wrong person for this role br br this was sue kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew it would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and imho it could be done with better writers and casting and direction
<START> about five minutes in and i saw where this was heading bunch of high school kids get annoyed by the <UNK> administration and thoughts of rebellion start <UNK> i said to my girlfriend if it gets below a 5 on imdb i'll go and read a book it got 5 0 so she <UNK> me to go on watching what are the good things well it is a good thing this film does not have a story because you would surely be distracted from it by the editing it's like the <UNK> drawing that was torn up by one of the teachers all the footage for this film was cut up in a freak accident involving a meat <UNK> and left half the stock destroyed with the other half spliced into two second bits even in a ten second scene of the local tv news there are about six cuts and three different angles and then there are the montages these are all set to electronic music which <UNK> you of yet another montage so that like <UNK> dog you start cringing every time you hear it which is about every three minutes oh i was supposed to say what's good about this film well the film was shot very well with a nice color palette that nicely matched the emotional content such as there was of the scenes okay now with the film's major flaw and it wasn't the story or lack thereof the director made that fatal mistake of leading you <UNK> about people and situations not by clever storytelling but by being highly <UNK> about what to show about the main characters that's just cheating i guess he did it in order to make the central character more likable but it just became plain annoying if the story is full of holes it's no good trying to <UNK> it up by <UNK> the viewer and often there wasn't even any point to it and then the ending basically the main villain of the peace turns out be an okay guy if a coward plus it turns what seemed to be the whole point of the movie that you should stand up for a just cause on its head by the already mentioned <UNK> and makes it into a point about the nature of <UNK> that was already made and much better by animal farm it also committed what i call the bill <UNK> sin no matter how things may seem at first in the end adults are always right and children always wrong and let's face it unless you're me that's just not true
<START> prom night 2 is an ok horror movie but prom night is way better and this movies about how the prom queen mary lou in 1957 gets killed by her boyfriend and comes back 30 years later for revenge the best actor in this movie is micheal <UNK> and the movie stars other ok actors and actress like justin louis i wendy <UNK> lisa <UNK> and richard <UNK> i and there are some good gore scenes like when mary lou kills the girl that is trying to hide in her locker by <UNK> the <UNK> together and how one of the students are on the computer and mary lou <UNK> him to death over all this is an ok good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10
<START> a surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a <UNK> pad a great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot <UNK> by a twin peaks ish influence in director <UNK> nicholas cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a <UNK> looking for the right thing to do j t walsh rip to a great actor is always a wonderful villain as is dennis hopper it's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the <UNK> i'm sure he has his followers though in all this is a great film that shows you that you don't need big <UNK> or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film
<START> okay so the plot is on shaky ground yeah all right so there are some randomly inserted song and or dance sequences for example <UNK> concert and <UNK> stage act and leslie caron can't really um you know act br br but somehow <UNK> american in <UNK> manages to come through it all as a polished first rate musical largely on the basis of gene kelly's incredible dancing talent and choreography and the <UNK> of charm he seems to be <UNK> into each scene with caron he needs to because she seems to have a problem with <UNK> br br the most accomplished and technically awe inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16 minute ballet towards the end of the film it's stunningly filmed and kelly and caron dance beautifully but my favourite number would have to be kelly's character singing 'i got <UNK> with a bunch of french school children then breaking into an array of american dances it just goes to prove how you don't need special effects when you've got some real talent br br not on the <UNK> level with <UNK> in the <UNK> but pretty high up there nonetheless worth the watch
<START> this movie is one long <UNK> after another first of all though they did their share there is a <UNK> <UNK> scene where john <UNK> <UNK> like an idiot the <UNK> and accents are terrible they sound worse then the old <UNK> cartoons john is the nasty <UNK> closet homosexual slave to <UNK> he is portrayed as being in the <UNK> albert <UNK> book they even keep <UNK> song titles in regular conversation it was always just the two of us john would not have been mean to his fans like this either like his death showed us he was too nice if anything the one funny scene is where a dumb <UNK> fan only <UNK> john and asks him to sing paul's yesterday an insulted john says something along the lines of sure and while i <UNK> why don't you get down on your knees put on your wife's wig and <UNK> my <UNK> that made me laugh for days really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous john and paul also did not sit <UNK> all day they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more <UNK> then portrayed here forget it
<START> there are so many words i want to use to describe this movie but can't really do that can i this movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit laugh cry and then pee i'm serious don't watch this movie if you're easily offended by profanity sex nudity homosexuality and everything else associated with nature being a woman and that might not even be a factor i can watch this movie over and over again <UNK> parker and matt stone are absolutely brilliant along with all their other <UNK> i think baseketball is the prize winner i'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie watch the movie that's all i'm going to say it's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because i'm one of those people like <UNK> <UNK> who has a curse word in almost every line that <UNK> out of their mouth when they speak so i'm keeping it professional best movie heck yeah
<START> really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace via drug addiction and later redemption one brother a self <UNK> genius played by james franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man child the other brother is a hard working future doctor who becomes less <UNK> as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his family's expectations for both children not too heavy handed as drug <UNK> are want to be and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about i'd recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and <UNK> james franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love
<START> wow br br this film is the best living testament i think of what happened on 9 11 <UNK> in nyc compared to anything shown by the major media <UNK> br br those <UNK> can only show you what happened on the outside this film shows you what happened on the inside br br it begins with a focus on a rookie new york <UNK> waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers you are then given a front row seat as <UNK> rush to the scene into the <UNK> of tower one br br in the minutes that <UNK> the crash of the second plane and tower <UNK> subsequent fall you see <UNK> <UNK> to the unsettling sound of people landing above the <UNK> it is a sight you will not soon forget br br heart <UNK> tear <UNK> and very compelling from the first minute to the last 9 11 deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made br br we must never forget br br
<START> what a muddled mess i saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open minded to the many wonders of cinema but this sure isn't one of them br br while there very well could be some good ideas concepts and there are certainly some good performances under the circumstances it is all buried under random nonsense sir anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as natural born killers u turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned or maybe he watched himself in <UNK> for inspiration say what you want about david lynch but at least he more often than not has a method to the madness br br his quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all it's not worth your money <UNK> or time
<START> you know the rest if you want a good zombie movie don't rent this movie if you want a documentary esquire look at hood life you're at the wrong place as well if you're looking for a laughable piece of film this is a real winner the acting is as flat as a piece of paper the best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive by i can tell that he did the voice for the <UNK> <UNK> as well by the flat tone of his voice if i could hear a cardboard box talk it'd probably sound like this guy oh <UNK> and the zombies did their best snake impression which is on par with their fantastic acting overall note sarcasm how did this not win an oscar for best make up the <UNK> did not do any sort of directing i felt like i was watching an <UNK> period piece the period is more like 1990's la the direction is however one <UNK> by the worst script i think to ever grace a movie i haven't heard such lovely lines like the epic one word beginning to the movie f k since ice <UNK> which was another urban thriller this only works of course in <UNK> with the also epic hip hop soundtrack all 3 or so songs of it all in all what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled hood of the living dead i rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene and boy it delivered and more i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror <UNK> right movie for the night a memorable experience for sure
<START> ostensibly a film that <UNK> the coming <UNK> in british popular music it's wrong on so many <UNK> that it's laughable tommy quickly the <UNK> the movie does include a song by the spencer davis group two by the animals and one tacked on live film of the beatles doing their live version of twist and shout all 1 20 but all in all an awkward display of british music circa 1964 oh and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the film portrays <UNK> <UNK> problems with its colonial legacy in western <UNK> africa through the <UNK> and complex <UNK> <UNK> of a young woman france <UNK> <UNK> representing her nation it is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past in particular and a <UNK> desire to reach out to the <UNK> it once <UNK> and <UNK> this is reflected in the way in which it <UNK> entirely around the notion of travelling or being in <UNK> from the present to the past remembered realities to <UNK> contemporary political and economic <UNK> br br the characters all play a symbolic albeit a limited and unconvincing role france meant to be a visual as well as a <UNK> representation of contemporary french society leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be <UNK> with the same <UNK> she enjoyed as a child in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality the rest of the <UNK> tag ensemble is just forgettable the black <UNK> are to say the least <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of former <UNK> peoples now <UNK> by the director's poor handling of her material they are no more than a dark and <UNK> backdrop against which the <UNK> like france wonders seeking a world she never knew and hoping for one that can never be found in <UNK>
<START> <UNK> 2 is little more than a pale imitation of the original designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film it even <UNK> the flaws of its predecessor which was often predictable and heavy handed still the first time around there were enough thrills to make up for it's <UNK> <UNK> resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort the sequel has few worthwhile moments so the <UNK> of the stories are even more apparent once in a while it delivers but most of the time it just <UNK> there br br as in the original all the stories <UNK> around the common theme of revenge and just <UNK> a wooden indian comes to life <UNK> vengeance upon the killers of its owner teenagers are <UNK> by an <UNK> monster a <UNK> returns from the dead to pursue a <UNK> <UNK> none of these premises are <UNK> bad in themselves but they are utterly lacking in inspiration there are few surprises and no scares this a <UNK> example of <UNK> by the numbers filmmaking it doesn't help that this cheap looking movie suffers from a flat directorial style although to be honest there wasn't much to work with in the end the second story comes off best but not by much br br for the most part the performances are okay at best george kennedy as the ill <UNK> general store owner does an adequate if not particularly inspired job dorothy <UNK> on the other hand is quite good as the guilt ridden <UNK> <UNK> sympathy for her plight despite the predictable redundant material however most of the characters are pretty thin overall br br one would think that <UNK> 2 would have turned out better george romero who directed the original returned to pen the screenplay based on more of stephen king's stories makeup effects artist tom <UNK> turns in some good gory work so why is the film a letdown i guess romero didn't really want to make a second film but was forced to do so for financial reasons it was a decade of horror sequels <UNK> rip offs and <UNK> so this one was certainly inevitable i can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry picking up his paycheck and running off i guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects <UNK> we can't blame him br br rating 1 2 out of br br released by new world pictures
<START> i checked this movie out based on a <UNK> review on this page it is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dud the only mystery here is how <UNK> winner f murray abraham got involved with such a lousy script
<START> luckily not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending br br but i'm glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie there are the usual toy <UNK> and a bit <UNK> plots but also very chilling and even daring moments considering the production year 1969 the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few <UNK> of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done and it's not just because of the two <UNK> actresses br br the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly no wonder and it certainly did hit me very effective also the <UNK> from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more <UNK> along the usual suspense and action this is not just a heroic war tale of one <UNK> side but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad well being a case of war mostly bad br br for the fans of composer <UNK> <UNK> this is also a must his work is always excellent touching but never over the top and i think i have to try to catch more movies with <UNK> <UNK> talk about <UNK> let's hope they get this on dvd soon so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem
<START> the journey of hope 1990 is about a trek that many <UNK> and poor <UNK> make so they could live the good life in switzerland these people are so desperate to live like <UNK> that they'll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land so many of them are <UNK> by greedy crooks who make their living off of <UNK> huge <UNK> for desperate people who are in a no win situation one family <UNK> the cold the <UNK> mountain range and <UNK> criminals only to discover that there's not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel this problem exists world wide not just in america some people tend to forget that a heart <UNK> of a film that'll leave you wondering why at the end br br highly recommended
<START> i just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago and i was very happy with the movie when i left it it's very intense and the closest i've come to crying in a movie in quite some time that is a credit to adam sandler who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels and who probably deserves an oscar <UNK> for it were it not coming out so early in the year don cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to <UNK> disturbed br br there is some humor but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the <UNK> moments as adam deals with his loss and don struggles to help him adam plays two levels very well when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable but when he is well less stable he's powerful and dark br br i recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss
<START> i've seen far too many flicks from this company this one is about middle of the pack one the good side its a bit more stylized and under control than some of their fare less of the <UNK> attempts at humor and more <UNK> to story for what its worth many of their titles like sexy sixth sense are buried by <UNK> performances and an amateurish sensibility on the other side i found the <UNK> sex scenes not as hot as some of their other flicks like vampire <UNK> gladiator <UNK> <UNK> or mistress frankenstein br br misty <UNK> is always a 10 on the peter <UNK> as is <UNK> caine i found barbara <UNK> hot in a school <UNK> kinda way and ruby <UNK> a sexy little <UNK> br br watch this with the remote firmly in your free hand on a night when you need a break from porn don't waste your time wanting to check the story you've got better things to do w your life it is not a movie it's pure t a but not bad by that standard
<START> this movie is a rather odd mix of musical romance drama and crime with a <UNK> of film noir to it it's basically one messy heap of different genres of which none really works out like it was supposed to br br this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor he's a former child star who always used to star in in happy comical and musical productions at the start of his career in this movie he picks a different approach although the musical aspects are still present in the movie but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie i mean mickey rooney as a tough player he's an extremely small <UNK> looking man he actually was in his 30's already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn't look and feel right he simply isn't convincing in his role br br because the movie mixes so many different genres the story also really feels as a messy one somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all it just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch <UNK> <UNK> is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime despite the fact that his career span from <UNK> till 1957 he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality br br let's also not forget that this is a <UNK> movie but yet it more feels like a <UNK> one or perhaps even as one from the <UNK> this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black white generally speaking black white movies from the <UNK> often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception br br it's a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence it wasn't the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies often simply as himself i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song br br an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney br br 4 10
<START> this early pia <UNK> vehicle followed a familiar harold robbins formula ambitious main character <UNK> in <UNK> while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world in this case the movie industry but despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable <UNK> to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be <UNK> never convinces as a screenwriter one would expect a movie about movie making to have some insights into its own industry and creative process but the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters <UNK> skill with words a love hate relationship with one's own creative abilities her character is as empty as a <UNK> hole and this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here the cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening and the scenes never really hang together so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad hollywood parties avoid
<START> college girl <UNK> murray takes on the <UNK> job of <UNK> the student <UNK> building to become apartments which includes selling the <UNK> furniture this takes place during a break so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly empty premises on campus <UNK> that <UNK> blood is a low budget slasher flick that is quite entertaining the acting is pretty bad the plot is predictable but the gore effects are quite good the film was made by <UNK> film students stephen carpenter and jeffrey <UNK> for next to nothing soon a dreamy ambiance kicks in very similar to the <UNK> <UNK> of jeff <UNK> fantastic just before dawn 7 out of 10 it's great to see daphne <UNK> of the <UNK> fame run over few times by a car
<START> apart from having the longest reign in british history <UNK> years queen victoria also holds two other <UNK> she was apart from our current queen the oldest ever british <UNK> living to the age of <UNK> and she was also the youngest ever british as opposed to english or scottish <UNK> coming to the throne as a girl of <UNK> and yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her they seem far more interested in the older victoria than they do in the young girl the version of victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is <UNK> <UNK> in mrs brown the young victoria tries to <UNK> the balance by showing us the events surrounding her <UNK> and the early years of her reign it has the rare distinction of being produced by a former royal sarah <UNK> of york whose daughter princess <UNK> makes a brief appearance as an extra br br there are three main <UNK> to the plot the first concerns the <UNK> of victoria's mother the <UNK> of kent a highly <UNK> figure even with her own daughter largely because of the influence of her <UNK> sir john <UNK> who was widely <UNK> to be her lover according to one <UNK> <UNK> he and not the late duke of kent was victoria's natural father the second <UNK> concerns the growing romance between victoria and her german cousin prince albert and the attempts of king leopold of <UNK> who was uncle to both of them to influence this romance <UNK> hope was to increase the <UNK> of the house of <UNK> <UNK> to which both he and albert <UNK> the third concerns one of the strangest episodes in british political history the <UNK> crisis of <UNK> when supporters of the <UNK> party which had <UNK> supported a strong <UNK> <UNK> because the young queen was perceived to favour the <UNK> party and their leader lord melbourne even though the <UNK> had historically supported a quasi <UNK> system of government with the <UNK> reduced to a <UNK> br br scriptwriter julian <UNK> is known for his conservative views and at times i wondered if this may have <UNK> his treatment of political themes as he seems to lean to the side of the <UNK> the predecessors of the modern conservative party their leader robert <UNK> is shown as <UNK> and <UNK> whereas melbourne for all his dash and charm is shown as <UNK> and <UNK> in social <UNK> there may be some truth is these <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> over the fact that only a few years earlier the <UNK> had opposed the <UNK> act which ended the corrupt <UNK> system of rotten <UNK> and that they had <UNK> from william <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a <UNK> administration br br lessons in <UNK> and <UNK> history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen and this one contains its share of inaccuracies prince albert for example was not injured in edward <UNK> attempt on victoria's life and melbourne in his late fifties at the time of victoria's <UNK> was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by paul <UNK> king william iv certainly disliked the <UNK> of kent who was his sister in law but i doubt if he would have gone so far as to <UNK> abuse at her during a state <UNK> as he is shown doing here i also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the <UNK> and <UNK> try to force victoria to sign a <UNK> order the <UNK> <UNK> position was made clear by the <UNK> act <UNK> which provided that she would become <UNK> if her daughter was still under <UNK> at the time of her <UNK> no piece of paper signed by victoria could have altered the <UNK> of the act br br there are also occasional <UNK> in one early scene we see victoria and albert playing chess while comparing themselves to <UNK> being moved around a <UNK> a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a danger major cliché ahead warning yet in spite of scenes like this i came to enjoy the film there were some good performances especially from miranda richardson as the scheming <UNK> and mark strong as the obnoxious <UNK> it is visually very attractive being shot in <UNK> style we have come to associate with british historical drama jim <UNK> gives an amusing turn as king william although he does occasionally <UNK> to the temptation of going over the top although not as <UNK> over the top as he was in <UNK> <UNK> br br the main reason for the film's success however is the performances of emily blunt and rupert friend as the two young lovers victoria and albert blunt is probably more attractive than victoria was in real life but in her delightful portrayal the queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination the black clad widow of <UNK> who was <UNK> not amused but a determined strong minded and loving young woman her love for albert and their happy family life together was one of the main reasons why the <UNK> succeeded in <UNK> itself in the affections of the british people with the exception of george iii victoria's <UNK> <UNK> had been <UNK> lacking in the <UNK> virtues blunt and friend make the young victoria a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in british history 8 10
<START> i saw this movie only after hearing <UNK> about it for years needless to say the actual experience proved a bit <UNK> but still alec <UNK> <UNK> leads a wonderful cast in a jolly if formulaic romp through industrial post wwii england br br this is the familiar tale of the <UNK> of <UNK> the perfect everyday product remember the car that runs on water remember the promise of nuclear energy in this case it's a fabric that doesn't wear out <UNK> or even get dirty of course fabric <UNK> and their workers are horrified at the <UNK> of being put out of business and so the plot gets a bit thick br br <UNK> makes the whole enterprise worthwhile and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast those brits always the stiff upper lip when under fire the film might <UNK> along exactly like <UNK> goofy invention but it's a good ride all the same
<START> i originally came across linda <UNK> seven minutes in heaven when i was 14 and worked at a video store and i loved it i recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure the movie stars jennifer <UNK> almost twenty years before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind as natalie <UNK> byron <UNK> plays her best friend in the world jeff <UNK> the film is definitely a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> version of the pretty in <UNK> and some kind of <UNK> of the 1980's which is exactly why it is so good it's honest not forced like those films and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids br br when <UNK> dad leave home on a business trip jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks with support from <UNK> friend polly played <UNK> by <UNK> corman she lets him but this movie isn't about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with the three leads are so natural and the script surprisingly so honest that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking these characters really do care about each other it's a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre teen <UNK> br br
<START> this film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid there is really not much i'd need or want to say here except maybe see this film and enjoy the excellent work by daniel and <UNK> who carries you through this neat funny and heartbreaking story about <UNK> your <UNK> <UNK> your own day br br seeing this film made me think seriously about how i spend my <UNK> day my life it appears that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do either if it's pleasing a career or just <UNK> tv shows and <UNK> what we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person make a difference about taking room and time to be spontaneous and live now on the <UNK> day at least that was what i got from 'the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> they are among us is poor science fiction at best mediocre acting <UNK> down this film the plot holes are numerous aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human in their alien form they supposedly have <UNK> <UNK> which is why they need the plastic surgery but when you see them they have teeth and <UNK> the <UNK> father disappeared after project blue book closed but was supposedly an f 16 pilot and on and on if you want to see an alien invasion movie pick invasion of the body <UNK> and see how it is done right
<START> this is peter <UNK> film period br br i was 10 years old when this film came out i was already a film <UNK> at the time of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out but i was in love with the <UNK> of its ads the aura that this was an important film okay <UNK> years later i've finally seen the film having never seen any cassavetes directed film previously he's a hack overall zero sense of timing editing <UNK> performance reminds me too much of dustin <UNK> <UNK> in rain man technically on par but entirely one note as tom cruise stole rain man falk takes the cake for this film br br i was annoyed with <UNK> performance really throughout it seemed better suited for <UNK> <UNK> it's not all her fault she's a basket case from first scene to last we never find out why but <UNK> character seems real is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man br br <UNK> off at least an hour an editor needed and this would have been an <UNK> portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple <UNK> <UNK> man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work yet cannot deal with her three kids her husband's long hours of work br br i'd rather remember cassavetes for the dirty dozen or rosemary's baby he would have been a better director had he <UNK> his own tendency for excess as he <UNK> demonstrates with this film br br bob
<START> if you like <UNK> you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this film yet this movie is crazy hilarious and <UNK> a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie it is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody i've ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy if you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old school performers <UNK> rent this movie there aren't that many video rental places that have copies of it but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed
<START> beautifully photographed and <UNK> acted generally but the writing is very <UNK> there are scenes of such <UNK> that there is no joy in the watching the fact that the young lover has a twin brother for instance is so contrived that i <UNK> out loud and the emotion light <UNK> connection seems <UNK> too br br i don't know though if you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few <UNK> comedic scenes this is a pretty good movie no major effort on the part of the viewer required but italian film especially italian comedy is usually much much better than this
<START> deliverance is john <UNK> 1972 horror thriller movie about a group of four <UNK> <UNK> burt reynolds jon voight ned beatty and <UNK> cox that <UNK> a <UNK> trip down the <UNK> river before the river is <UNK> along the way a raft no pun intended of unpleasant things happen to the men despite the nasty happenings in this picture <UNK> captures the natural beauty of the river nicely the location was really chosen well indeed this would still be a very nice film to watch had the <UNK> trip gone smoothly the lush <UNK> and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible not only is the location <UNK> but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> it has been said that burt <UNK> performance as the <UNK> lewis is the star acting role in this film i <UNK> however that jon voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man ed who is rapidly forced to change his <UNK> in order to survive in fact the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a <UNK> it was voight himself to cut costs the filming wasn't <UNK> and the actors did their own stunts the soundtrack is particularly noteworthy eric <UNK> and steve <UNK> performance on guitar and <UNK> as part of the <UNK> <UNK> sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance at a couple of other points in the movie we are treated to more <UNK> <UNK> music which provides a very pleasant <UNK> to the trip down the river for all the good points of this film i did find it a little lacking in purpose it doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe the plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere nevertheless this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation i did like it but for fans of gore there isn't really much of it none really in fact it isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour think of it like rambo first blood meets three men in a boat look out for a very young <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> son i did like this movie the soundtrack cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10
<START> i can't believe this film was allowed to be made these people should be drug out and beat with blunt objects they should be tortured this film is an abomination it's nothing but footage from the first film whatever is original is freaky and makes no sense whatsoever it's like some sort of drug <UNK> like what's with the laying on a mirror naked therapy also whatever moron <UNK> together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film because they kept calling <UNK> <UNK> character natalie when it's <UNK> i felt like shouting that at the screen it's <UNK> it's <UNK> i give it a 50 out of 10 my god
<START> what an overlooked 80's soundtrack i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to <UNK> everything that was 80s cheese clearly movies that rely on mechanical <UNK> <UNK> and immature relationships were in style the best was his lousy texas accent compare that to friday night lights i suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the <UNK> down of film also as a side note made in america with ted <UNK> and <UNK> goldberg is an <UNK> bad movie i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it one more weird movie of this genre would have to include <UNK> man with robin williams just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies tom cruise richard <UNK> robin williams and john travolta
<START> i looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was <UNK> by the unnecessary swearing now i am not a <UNK> in any way but to shout <UNK> at each other does not a good film make ewan <UNK> is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time witness his performance in the god awful life of stuff his cockney accent is almost as bad as his <UNK> accent avoid how many more of these films kiss kiss bang bang beautiful creatures do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the f word the c word etc does not replace proper dialogue
<START> warning review contains mild spoilers br br a couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise and was planning to do an <UNK> of the whole elm st series however just two years on and i find i can't remember enough about them in order to do it  i guess they couldn't have made much of an impression from what i do recall some of the sequels  dream warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out though even the original was no classic generally the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams doesn't lend itself to narrative tension but while i cannot recall much of the first five films i do know they never <UNK> the depths of freddy's dead br br an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise the fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how <UNK> soulless and cynical this venture was br br taking the morally questionable idea of having a child <UNK> as the charismatic villain robert <UNK> in no way scary interpretation <UNK> with laughter i always thought freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe it's like <UNK> crying out we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it so who's the one laughing and i'm sure victims of child abuse would be <UNK> to see such an <UNK> depiction of their plight was freddy's appearance in the films always so <UNK> all he gets to do here is a few <UNK>  <UNK>  <UNK>  <UNK> and that's it if this was the only elm st film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all even as the character pre death in a flashback englund plays him as a boo <UNK> <UNK> villain with a <UNK> of <UNK> ie <UNK> misplaced and not at all funny irony br br acting is almost universally poor just look at how many times <UNK> meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language only <UNK> himself <UNK> <UNK> keeps his dignity and when <UNK> tom arnold and alice cooper show up you can almost <UNK> see the film sinking further into the <UNK> the script too is absolutely lousy almost wholly without merit carlos ricky dean logan opens a road map upon which the <UNK> coward like freddy has <UNK> written you're f <UNK> when <UNK> for the map carlos responds well the map says we're f <UNK> who wrote the screenplay oscar <UNK> br br or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy his hearing enhanced to painful levels so freddy <UNK> him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound given that all sounds are <UNK> oddly the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect nice hearing from you carlos <UNK> freddy hoping some better lines will come along it's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur <UNK> so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into freddy's world though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3 d finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of <UNK> br br the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious <UNK> group in the whole series tracy <UNK> <UNK> is the only one who gets to <UNK> freddy with shut the f k up man and a kick in the <UNK> and was <UNK> pop music always part of the ingredients freddy's dead no laughs no scares no interest no fun br br
<START> this movie really is a mixed bag on the one hand the story and concept of the movie are really good tense and have some nice plot twists in it but than again on the other hand it all is told very slow without style and <UNK> still i regard just cause as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast br br maybe sean connery was miscast in his role i mean he isn't really that believable as a the main <UNK> and father of a young daughter played by a still very young scarlett johansson by the way and husband of kate <UNK> i feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it however sean <UNK> is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does but he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like laurence fishburne blair <UNK> ned beatty hope lange <UNK> <UNK> and ed harris all actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time which is a real shame as well as a missed opportunity especially ed harris is just totally great in his role as a <UNK> serial killer he's truly chilling and acting superbly normally he doesn't play this ruthless chilling sort of roles in movies so he really surprises with his role in this one his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie however due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant br br it really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential <UNK> <UNK> directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times because of this we as viewers never really get involved with the story or any of it's characters br br it really is too bad for just cause had more than enough potential a fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller that will probably still please the fan of the genre it however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre br br 7 10
<START> do not be mistaken this is neither a horror nor really a film i firmly advise against watching this <UNK> minute failure the only reason it <UNK> a star was the presence of chris <UNK> br br nothing happens you wait <UNK> in the hope that there may be a <UNK> of a twist a hint of surprise a plot to emerge but no br br the characters take <UNK> turns of pace in their actions and yet don't have the time to develop thanks to the <UNK> <UNK> and frankly ashamed writers before returning to an <UNK> and playful bring on the teen rock montage state the only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the <UNK> token ethnic <UNK> br br their encounters with obstacles be they human or physical are brief confusing and entirely pointless br br chris <UNK> fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast lou taylor <UNK> couldn't be <UNK> if he spent the summer with keanu <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> desert br br watch 'the <UNK> watch <UNK> days <UNK> watch day time tv anything but this i <UNK> you suffer the boredom unlike you may be led to believe in the film this film is no cure
<START> the main problem i see with this film is its score which screams with every note this is a cheap ass movie there's not much more to say here the score just plain sucked br br the second problem which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the <UNK> of the plot near the end of the film one of the the money shots if you will is the dialogue between martha <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> man richard <UNK> in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment at all times during this dialogue the viewer is very much aware that s he is listening to a movie dialogue in other words suspension of disbelief breaks down here the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy <UNK> <UNK> of information the movie makers wish to <UNK> to the audience br br the third problem was the casting of <UNK> <UNK> while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her <UNK> i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch the main point of her performance that didn't seem to <UNK> was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo like woman on a mission this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress and one cannot place too much blame therefore upon <UNK> to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part however i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole br br finally the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor most notably during its horror flashes i feel that the film would have <UNK> by more of a commitment to these flashes as a <UNK> for <UNK> a <UNK> of the creep factor in the second half of the movie br br so what's my <UNK> <UNK> of this piece i'd give it a solid c to b depending upon how much credit you're inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget even with two severe and two moderately severe problems the film is <UNK> on the solid plot of the <UNK> side of nazi <UNK> i see no problems with plot development or <UNK> the dialogue with the noted exception above is downright brilliant in places especially the all important <UNK> scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie as mentioned the creep factor was well crafted if a bit <UNK> in the second half and nicholas brendan who also associated produced delivered a wonderful performance br br all in all this film is definitely worth the view see it with a nazi you love
<START> i felt a great joy after seeing this film not because it is a master piece but because it convinced me of that the portuguese cinema became really very good we can see here the best portuguese <UNK> in this field
<START> ever wonder why pacific <UNK> seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of black americans regardless of their ethnic origins well this film will not provide any answers to this often <UNK> question but it will provide an excellent case study br br from its <UNK> this film acts as a sort of old school for pacific island new <UNK> which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task is it meant to <UNK> <UNK> stereotypes of pacific island new <UNK> or is it intended to exploit this potential market the story is weak jokes <UNK> and the ending is expected this film has done nothing for new zealand cinema as it is merely an <UNK> romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit
<START> if you haven't already seen this movie of mary kate and <UNK> then all i can say is what are you waiting for this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the <UNK> twins that we all know and love so much it's fun romantic exciting and absolutely breath taking scenery wise of course as always mary kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway would any true fan want it any other way of course not anyway it's a great movie in every sense of the word so if you haven't already seen it then you just have to now i mean right now too so what are you waiting for i promise that you won't be disappointed sincerely rick morris
<START> this was one of the funniest and informative shows that i have ever seen this is a must see for anyone over the age of 16 this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning i don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that mr <UNK> was not only very <UNK> but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in <UNK> if mr <UNK> ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the georgia <UNK> to hold all the people who will want to see it i agree with the idea of making this a hbo series it would have an amazing following
<START> this is the second baby <UNK> short to be released and probably the most popular one is a spoof of the <UNK> silent film what price glory br br i watched this and i do not understand the kiddie porn that is being claimed it is just a cute little film i have seen family shows that i grew up watching in the <UNK> and <UNK> that had little girls dressed more <UNK> acting in a <UNK> <UNK> it was more provocative because they weren't dressed in <UNK> there's nothing provocative about a <UNK> unless you have one of those <UNK> just a joke i read that description of the movie and where it states only a <UNK> would enjoy watching this that is sick to me if you watch this and are bothered by it then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film all of the b b films were parodies nothing more the parodies spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language shouldn't those be more appalling i can watch those without issue but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies that is what should get under your skin not that they <UNK> not a word i know an adult movie from <UNK> because we know how pornographic those silent films were huh not to mention those <UNK> hollywood pre code era <UNK> so vile and filthy they would never make such filth today note the sarcasm
<START> having the in laws over for the weekend then this is the film to <UNK> their departure failing that it will <UNK> a <UNK> state to bring a welcome relief from constant <UNK> br br the film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship which is more <UNK> car ferry the plot has more holes than the average <UNK> and a cast <UNK> from the depths of the celebrity d list an interesting piece of added amusement is playing spot the villain as passengers join the ship you won't be wrong with a script that sinks faster than a brick clichéd set pieces and <UNK> amounts of <UNK> jam <UNK> as blood this film attempts to <UNK> the genres of thriller action movie and gore fest and simultaneously fails to <UNK> any of them br br a must watch film if only to laugh at how bad it is
<START> <UNK> cliched thriller has young couple doing cross country research on america's most infamous murder sites becoming road partners with a dim witted young woman and her <UNK> boyfriend who is an actual psycho arty and <UNK> the film's tone <UNK> between <UNK> pseudo irony and silly <UNK> <UNK> made perhaps but ultimately laughable brad <UNK> performance as the low rent killer is <UNK> from
<START> prior to watching dahmer i thought no movie could be worse than freddy got <UNK> i was wrong to sum dahmer up it's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of <UNK> encounters with gay men before they were killed there is no plot to be found and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about dahmer all you'll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men horrible acting horrible directing horrible writing horrible everything if you have to choose between watching dahmer and <UNK> <UNK> for three hours go with the <UNK> it <UNK> be less painful
<START> i simply never tire of watching <UNK> my husband was an extra so i was involved from the start have kept in touch with jon and have helped out with promoting the film both in cinemas and now the dvd release even to the extent of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on cross channel <UNK> and various places throughout france <UNK> was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice casting only phil daniels could fit the role of <UNK> great <UNK> to meet jon and the cast at the party following the <UNK> in january anything else you want doing jon just ask either email or phone you know how to get me sue <UNK>

<START> despite the feelings of most star wars fans in my opinion return of the jedi is the greatest cinematic film ever created ever since the first time i saw it it's depth intensity special effects and moving story have overwhelmed me the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years filled with powerful action as the climax of the original trilogy george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the star wars saga in jedi br br film summary contains spoilers for those who have not seen it br br after the empire strikes back left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in return of the jedi darth vader in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new <UNK> death star to <UNK> it's construction the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side luke <UNK> leia <UNK> and the <UNK> all travel to <UNK> to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord <UNK> the <UNK> after han has been rescued and <UNK> defeated luke returns to <UNK> to find a dying <UNK> where he learns the awful truth darth vader is in fact his father the rebel heroes <UNK> with the rebel fleet now joined by other species and races including the <UNK> <UNK> the rebels must make a all or nothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed while <UNK> heads the space attack in the millennium <UNK> the rebel heroes must <UNK> the death <UNK> shield <UNK> on the forest moon of <UNK> it is here that the rebels happen upon the <UNK> but mighty ewoks during the the two part intense battle a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor <UNK> out his dark emotions as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of <UNK> vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life br br filled with a deep timeless story of good vs evil return of the jedi is a spectacular emotionally charged film that <UNK> the good in all of us
<START> spoilers sex huh it's one of the most basic parts of human life yet do we ever take it too seriously people always want more even those who get it on a daily basis and if you are unlucky there are potential life changing creating consequences ironically people claim we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age despite <UNK> getting married and having children in their early teens so it must be increasingly difficult for those who get to a point as <UNK> in steve <UNK> first big screen lead he plays a man who has gotten to 40 without managing it treating us to countless <UNK> and extreme sex related incidents not to mention more profanity than an episode of <UNK> the general plot of the film and it's principle doesn't sound funny it's a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate failed jokes there are an incredibly large number of ones which hit the mark and leave the audience in <UNK> br br andy <UNK> carell is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant <UNK> at the same time though he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member <UNK> friends discover his secret at the age of 40 andy is still a virgin now for multiple reasons but mostly pity the three men paul rudd seth <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all offer andy advice with one goal in mind to put him out of his misery and get him laid br br one of the few good things about anchorman it was only going to be a matter of time before steve carell got himself a lead of his own <UNK> in the 40 year old virgin he doesn't disappoint showing the hopeless shy virgin to perfection carell is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help br br carell is not alone however in his performance rudd <UNK> <UNK> and catherine <UNK> as the love interest are all superb rudd is a personal favourite as the love sick david who falls apart at multiple times and shares the finest scene with <UNK> as the two argue over homosexuality br br the biggest surprise about this film is not the way that so many of the jokes hit the mark but actually the clever way that it <UNK> the message on it's head obviously designed for conservative america the film's entire tone <UNK> from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and <UNK> the virgin doesn't need sex to make his life complete he just needs confidence and true love a worthy message to <UNK> and a considerable improvement on the one you expect to see at the beginning of the film br br it's weird to see a crude comedy which is consistently funny and well acted but low and behold 40 year old virgin is just that throw in a well meaning message too and you're well on the way to a top class comedy a surprising joy
<START> it all started with true heart bear noble heart horse get the club to safety noble heart horse meet dawn john took them to see true heart bear later the care <UNK> went down more true heart bear noble heart horse check to see if it dark heart but they can't go unless the club at care for so they ask dawn john to care for the club after true heart bear noble heart horse come back they send dawn john back to camp than the club cousin bears have grown up to get ready to fight dark heart at the end dark heart kidnap all the care bear the kids dawn john have to tell christy that dark heart is evil than they work to together to save the care bears later true heart bear noble heart horse found out it dark heart shadow return to care land to find that their gone the kids dawn john christy come but they was not powerful to stop dark heart true heart bear noble heart horse come to help dawn john christy to free the other care bears but christy got in the way was hit by dark heart magic than dark heart saw christy got hit stop fighting the care bear in order to help her but he can't because dark heart himself don't have the power of caring to save christy the care bears the kids help dark heart save christy now dark heart starting to care became a real boy to fall in love with christy dark heart is now a real boy help out christy to work out in camp br br this is a great move ever the best care bears movie i ever seeing br br i like all the care bears movies i can't wait to see care bears big wish movie 2005 br br who like this movie
<START> watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early <UNK> a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as die hard in a on a cliffhanger is die hard on a mountain and pretty good for what it is br br but unlike passenger <UNK> and under siege which are decent die hard <UNK> on their own terms cliffhanger <UNK> with the <UNK> feeling of many action movies and <UNK> breathtaking landscapes that in their <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks br br years before other movies like a simple plan and <UNK> <UNK> crime and murder on <UNK> locations cliffhanger director <UNK> <UNK> recognized the visual impact of <UNK> brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings br br the opening sequence has already received substantial praise all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the <UNK> of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening not even <UNK> shot of the falling stuffed animal which is <UNK> effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in deep blue sea or the ridiculous expression on ralph <UNK> face can dim the <UNK> power br br the next impressive set piece is the <UNK> and heist aboard the jet as written by stallone and michael france and directed by <UNK> the audience is <UNK> into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the <UNK> and which are not the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected as roger ebert has observed the <UNK> who made the mid air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition br br later during the <UNK> sequence one of the terrorists thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain so far as i know no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts so obviously a <UNK> was used for the shot but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how <UNK> or more likely one of the second unit directors knew exactly where to place the camera br br i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can <UNK> a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feels that pain the role of <UNK> walker really <UNK> <UNK> acting strengths he plays an older more vulnerable kind of action hero giving an <UNK> low key performance as a mountain <UNK> who must redeem himself br br in contrast to many of today's post matrix comic book inspired action heroes <UNK> walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any <UNK> or computer enhanced abilities in cliffhanger the hero almost <UNK> to death and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another he <UNK> when he's hit and <UNK> when he's cut particularly in the <UNK> sequence when he takes a rocky style <UNK> from one of the mad dog villains br br it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's <UNK> when i first saw this movie as a teenager i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and <UNK> when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather the ice at one point i actually <UNK> as one of the most cold blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise br br <UNK> british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter but he's <UNK> a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly <UNK> silly dialogue in one scene looking at his <UNK> stallone and <UNK> trying to decide which tasks to give them he actually says you stay you <UNK> even a better actor such as anthony hopkins might have had trouble with that line br br even if cliffhanger occasionally <UNK> credibility aside it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show br br early in the movie for example <UNK> openly says to one of his men <UNK> stallone when he comes down no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even <UNK> his <UNK> allows <UNK> to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face and this <UNK> a gripping <UNK> of war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg br br <UNK> could have given his order by a more subtle means but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given <UNK> an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his <UNK> br br done very much in the style of a saturday <UNK> serial or at times a western cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have <UNK> a lesser film br br besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap <UNK> sets with really fake snow as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action packed narrative finally <UNK> decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes br br it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time without a sequel there are enough tired and <UNK> movie <UNK> already there was an <UNK> sequel that called itself <UNK> limit compared to that <UNK> cliffhanger belongs on the <UNK> top 250 list br br rating 8 very good especially considering most of <UNK> other movies
<START> once again the two <UNK> <UNK> must join together to save the lost world the five members of the first expedition return see the lost world 1992 for a list of actors a man seeking oil brings a <UNK> crew to the <UNK> instead of striking oil they tap an underground <UNK> which threatens all life in the lost world the oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition although the situation looks hopeless i'm not going to tell you the ending
<START> ok so obviously <UNK> thought this was a good movie in 1955 br br i pity the fools who still think so its absolute rubbish br br the story is just ridiculous the characters are absurd caricatures but this film is not meant to <UNK> im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn't it br br dean and others are too old for their parts people say dean is great in this film and well maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could've his character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so but dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film seeing him <UNK> and throw little <UNK> like a 4 year old boy its pathetic br br natalie wood is gorgeous but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing it sets a bad <UNK> for the film and for the rest of it you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along br br it <UNK> been good for its time but really its drivel br br it must've just been hype about <UNK> death that has over <UNK> the reputation of this film
<START> of the three remakes on w <UNK> <UNK> novel this one is the best one and not particularly because what john <UNK> brought to the film the film is worth a look because of the break through performance by bette davis who as mildred rogers showed the film industry she was a star finally her struggles with jack warner and his studio paid off <UNK> br br the film is dominated by mildred from the start we realize from the beginning that mildred doesn't care for philip and never will she doesn't hide her contempt for this kind soul that has fallen in love with the wrong woman he will be <UNK> by mildred again and again as she makes no bones about what she really is br br poor philip carey besides of being <UNK> is a man who is weak when he tries to <UNK> onto mildred she rejects him it is when mildred returns to him when she is <UNK> and defeated that he rises to the occasion <UNK> his own <UNK> on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his <UNK> br br bette davis gives a fantastic portrayal of mildred this was one of her best roles and she ran away with it her disgust toward the kind philip is clear from the <UNK> of their relationship when she tells him she <UNK> her mouth after he kisses her is one of the most powerful moment in the movie leslie howard <UNK> philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is frances dee <UNK> <UNK> alan hale and <UNK> owen are seen in minor roles br br this is bette davis show and don't you forget it
<START> i first saw ice age in the <UNK> cinemas when it came out back in <UNK> i was only 13 at the time but even then i liked it it had some sort of warmth br br we've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it it never gets boring this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time the characters have no particular <UNK> which they leave they are <UNK> and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch br br also each individual character on the surface appear to be just putting up with each other but they're really all good friends as well all of the characters have their own charms even the bad guys sid the <UNK> is charming in his annoying over <UNK> and naive sort of way <UNK> is adorable in his depressed <UNK> character and so on and so forth br br another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation all the <UNK> and characters were <UNK> originally by clay giving the film an artistic edge br br another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie is that gender means very little there are hardly any female characters but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film due to this there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age br br all in all ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before shrek 2 and the <UNK> came out
<START> one of the most heart warming foreign films i've ever seen br br the young girl is an amazing talent stellar performances by her <UNK> the old man the king of masks and <UNK> the living <UNK> br br spoiler the <UNK> treatment of children especially females is disturbing br br loved the music the original chinese dialog <UNK> the emotional intensity of the performances and the story br br this is a must see enjoyable family film although not for very young children would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version
<START> <UNK> is absolutely incredible what else can i say michael jackson is the true king of pop rock and soul <UNK> has everything great story line fantastic music great visual effects and of course it has michael jackson
<START> as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years whether one concentrates on the religious or the <UNK> traditions it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other that has somehow slipped past one <UNK> scrooge <UNK> and money <UNK> in 19th century london br br as his nephew points out to his uncle he doesn't keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is <UNK> the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago he's a hard case a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart mr potter of <UNK> falls new york br br but as charles dickens told this tale redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him how br br a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was the characters in this film are middle and lower class the <UNK> are a couple of <UNK> above the street people in oliver twist but they are having to struggle to stay up there still love and happiness <UNK> their home no thanks to the guy bob <UNK> works for br br like george <UNK> who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much <UNK> scrooge needed a wake up call as to the <UNK> he still had for doing some good in this old world br br patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge but george c scott captures the old <UNK> pretty well in this film the <UNK> of him but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change scott joins a fine tradition of people like <UNK> owen and <UNK> <UNK> who've both done great interpretations of scrooge br br among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob <UNK> and edward <UNK> as a <UNK> and stern spirit of christmas present br br according to imdb this is one of <UNK> versions of a christmas carol made that they have <UNK> and it is one of the best
<START> that is the only thing i can positive to say about this movie cleveland is the star i've been there and never saw the city look this good beautiful river and <UNK> br br this movie moves ahead at such a pace they hope you won't notice the lack of real world relevance people running around and shooting guns without any consequence for example there is a shoot out at rob <UNK> character's house two cars are stolen and yet the cops don't show up there till much later in the movie murder for hire never looked so implausible br br whoever wrote this movie should be on the receiving end of one the movies countless stray bullets many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this i check the date of the movie just to make sure it wasn't written during the writers strike but alas this was not the case this movie is currently in <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> channel unless you want to <UNK> of over lowe there is no reason to watch it
<START> i thought this move was very good there were a few things that were less than perfect but overall i was quite surprised the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic but was real enough to be entertaining i found that the movie <UNK> the <UNK> of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts
<START> spoilers this is a gripping movie about <UNK> but who is <UNK> who here when does the hunter turn into the prey this gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path only to <UNK> you just as you think you are safe br br it has a riveting script with good acting at least from the leads i didn't notice the background music but it was never jarring so it must have been done right br br i was very surprised that i liked this movie because i don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end
<START> bela lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to dracula he is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old <UNK> horror films this movie doesn't set the mood very well even at its worst any of <UNK> movies is only mediocre though
<START> okay the recent history of star trek has not been good the next generation faded in its last few seasons <UNK> <UNK> stayed where no one had stayed before and voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise so when they announced a new star trek series i did not have high expectations and the first episode broken bow did have some problems but overall it was solid trek material and a good romp br br i'll get the <UNK> out of the way first the opening theme is dull and i don't look forward to sitting through it regularly but that's what <UNK> are for what was really bad was the completely gratuitous <UNK> <UNK> scene that just about drove my wife out of the room they need to cut that nonsense out br br but the plot was strong and moved along well the characters though still new seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect the <UNK> are clearly being presented very differently than before with a slightly ominous theme i particularly liked the <UNK> who is the first star trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death but rather has to deal with her <UNK> and fears they seemed to stay true to trek <UNK> something that has been a significant problem in past series though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through <UNK> the instant invention of technology that can fix anything and the inevitable <UNK> of time travel stories anyone want to start a pool on how long before the <UNK> show up br br all in all the series has enormous potential they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series how did the <UNK> go from just insulting to war how did we meet the <UNK> how did the <UNK> form and just who put earth in charge why is the prime <UNK> so important if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes this will be an interesting series br br my favorite line <UNK> <UNK> saying where no man has gone before not no one
<START> fail i'd love to give this crap a 0 yes i <UNK> just to rate this garbage i want to go back in time and cut my <UNK> <UNK> some copy and <UNK> to take up 10 lines fail i'd love to give this crap a 0 yes i <UNK> just to rate this garbage i want to go back in time and cut my <UNK> <UNK> some copy and <UNK> to take up 10 lines fail i'd love to give this crap a 0 yes i <UNK> just to rate this garbage i want to go back in time and cut my <UNK> <UNK> some copy and <UNK> to take up 10 lines fail i'd love to give this crap a 0 yes i <UNK> just to rate this garbage i want to go back in time and cut my <UNK> <UNK> some copy and <UNK> to take up 10 lines fail i'd love to give this crap a 0 yes i <UNK> just to rate this garbage i want to go back in time and cut my <UNK> <UNK> some copy and <UNK> to take up 10 lines
<START> dark angel is a futuristic sci fi series set in post apocalyptic seattle <UNK> on max jessica alba a <UNK> enhanced young woman on the run from her creators br br the dark angel universe is absorbing not as much as say buffy but absorbing nonetheless with an interesting and believable set of characters certainly it is not for everyone but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there dark angel is criminally overlooked and under rated and was <UNK> canceled after only 2 series which was a great shame as this had the potential to become a great series although its <UNK> episodes are only 10 shy of long running bbc sci fi comedy red dwarf as it is dark angel remains unfinished so seek it out and if you want more <UNK> fox to make another series
<START> this long <UNK> film turns out to be less about <UNK> and his effect on nyc but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of italian americans known <UNK> as <UNK> the problem is that <UNK> are uninteresting no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in they are already living caricatures so lee only <UNK> them rather than simply portraying them br br when someone has a caricature done of themselves they don't go home and say hey let's make the ears and nose even bigger that's what lee has done in this film the most interesting characters in the film are the two adrian <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> who wish to escape the <UNK> lifestyle top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters particularly john <UNK> and you get a nice film to fall asleep by especially considering it's lengthy run time br br one more strike against it for someone <UNK> to be a <UNK> fan and has grown up in new york spike lee should know how to spell phil <UNK> which is spelled <UNK> in the closing credits
<START> i'm into bad movies but this has nothing going for it despite what the morons above have said it is not funny i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director writer should be <UNK> from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again to love movies and comedy is to despise this film i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was if you like this movie you are a <UNK> as sober there is nothing here zero if you need to compare underground movies see kentucky fried movie or early john waters the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire the rule for comedy is this if it's funny you can say or do anything but if it's not funny you are not satirical you are not edgy you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny zero
<START> i was utterly disappointed by this movie i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations i expected a drama with more intense character development but that never happens in the movie daniel day lewis is a good actor but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe i <UNK> he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie i would rate his performance 6 out of 10 br br acting 6 out of 10 direction is 5 out of 10 script is the worst 2 out of 10 br br i deleted the movie from my <UNK> at 70 mins into the movie much better movies out there than this
<START> why is this movie not in the 250 best this movie looks still <UNK> fresh <UNK> years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of w w ii because of the perception of the <UNK> of death people were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment and what after life i liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered the <UNK> judge abraham <UNK> a typical british judge doctor reeves roger <UNK> defending peter carter david niven and also june kim hunter against the american <UNK> abraham <UNK> raymond massey i there is a reason why it is an american it is all so imaginative michael powell wrote directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real tour de force the message of the movie is clear in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans the way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any hollywood movie could ever make
<START> i thought this was an utterly charming film the story seems to be a <UNK> <UNK> autobiography of john waters <UNK> greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places edward <UNK> does well in the lead but the best performances are by his grandmother <UNK> stole a hilarious cameo and of all people patty <UNK> i think the reviewers are way off base on this one they seem to be taking <UNK> worst <UNK> of his work as <UNK> when i think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist
<START> we have all been asking ourselves why don't they remake the slasher films that were only ok instead of <UNK> the ones that were great already that way they can only make it better well with prom night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s jamie lee curtis film and made it even worse its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens hence no violence etc the knife in this slasher flick is blunt the director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window the cast who include britney snow who was superb in <UNK> try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but <UNK> and look scared more annoying is how the death scenes are handled we will hear the attack but wont see it it also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing <UNK> since the film looks like it has been butchered im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids yet in <UNK> the money from americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office slasher movies are a lot of fun but in prom nights case it made me want to <UNK> the original i've seen scarier <UNK> and <UNK> creek episodes
<START> how sad to see the beautiful and talented tina louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film tina still looked fit and attractive but for some reason seems truly frightened i can understand her fear <UNK> that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public also i'm a fan of the likable adam west again as with tina adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age his acting here is passable but the script is so bad that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog br br the movie is a rip off of the classic brando biker flick the wild ones out law biker gang is out of control in a small <UNK> town the <UNK> here look like a <UNK> group and i sure wouldn't want them to date my sister the acting is stiff and wooden and the story plot is as old as sand <UNK> is hell to watch
<START> <UNK> <UNK> starring michel <UNK> is a brutal story about a brutal man a doctor who <UNK> the sick in occupied france even if their ability to compensate is not there yet he <UNK> on the weakest amidst the <UNK> the imagery and cinematography are superb and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story he is the perfect psychopath seductive and <UNK> intelligent and caring <UNK> and murderous a movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer kudos to mr <UNK> for his chilling portrayal
<START> it seems to me as a recent film school graduate that in these times of new zealand film reaching new heights the general public seems to think every new zealand film made is great <UNK> wedding proves this is dead wrong br br it's completely overrated and not funny and far from the <UNK> film other users of imdb have commented the only really funny thing i found in this film was derek the wannabe black guy but other than that the jokes were recycled crap that we'd all heard before br br being of half <UNK> decent i wanted to see how the film was going to deal with <UNK> representation it was a complete balls up i know it's a supposed comedy but i didn't feel like the characters had anything new to say about <UNK> identity even if it was in a tongue in cheek manner i was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the character's relationships <UNK> was the player who only messed around with white women comes to slightly turn his ways when the <UNK> <UNK> comes to town has an <UNK> that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship then at the very last minute rejects it and accepts his position as a <UNK> playboy for <UNK> women i didn't understand why they did this br br all in all it was very disappointing my whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh but ended up being really bitter about paying to see it at the cinema the jokes are lame at best the acting particularly of <UNK> girlfriend appalling and honestly i would've been happy if i had got my hands on one of those <UNK> copies of the film to save myself the 15 ticket price br br i think the only good thing to come from the movie is that it's the second step behind no 2 of course a far superior film to this one in the birth of <UNK> cinema i hope pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from <UNK> wedding in how to not reflect <UNK> and have something more meaningful and sensible to say even if it is done in a comedic fashion
<START> this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with but first the movie it's a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with william <UNK> what they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras why move the movie up to 1966 so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war <UNK> why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement br br as for the casting some hits some misses jay o sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand miss a lot of the notes he's believable as an ex <UNK> jock but he doesn't have the raw <UNK> of william <UNK> i always thought <UNK> looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him <UNK> the pun gretchen <UNK> was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played she didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required maybe it's because she and <UNK> were about 5 years older than the characters should be but then again <UNK> was ten years too old bonnie <UNK> was rather forgettable as the mother and mary <UNK> can't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> from the <UNK> of the <UNK> br br as for mr <UNK> play i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over <UNK> always needed an <UNK> the twilight zone i believe offer a likely <UNK> with the episode <UNK> of the moment where a young diana <UNK> was being chased by a bitter older diana <UNK> because the younger diana <UNK> chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter
<START> <UNK> is a horror comedy that doesn't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other it has one scene that is exceptionally good any number of <UNK> that work but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie in addition the script does not focus on the hero and heroine and goes off <UNK> in several places br br a major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero <UNK> to follow grant grant michael <UNK> as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster this whole part of the film drags michael <UNK> character isn't that interesting to us as a person and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the <UNK> interest might be interesting if this was grant portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horror comedy alien invasion movie in the final analysis this movie's problems are in the script it isn't that important to the audience how the monster acts or <UNK> the purpose of a horror comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with <UNK> and then throw bugs at them with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens instead we get an exploration of the <UNK> <UNK> and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag the <UNK> heroine elizabeth banks as <UNK> grant is more central to this part but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the end br br when <UNK> and his <UNK> finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook but once again the problem is in the script by this point that audience knows and the characters should know that grant is not just suffering from some disease and act <UNK> <UNK> instead they continuously <UNK> in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help although their reactions might have been human and real these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised delivered action a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing br br spoilers ahead after the first confrontation and the <UNK> of the alien <UNK> sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien the writer director <UNK> chooses as this character a completely new character rather than one of already developed minor characters why why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot by the time this character is attacked we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her even though she is a <UNK> teenage girl in her bath had <UNK> decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters he could have completely avoided introducing her family and saved time and money furthermore the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the <UNK> plans without all the additional characters and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more <UNK> br br my last criticism is based on the movie's look <UNK> is primarily a writer or maybe it was <UNK> constraints but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field and the screen simply looks drab the sets in <UNK> the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap the whole movie looks cheap box office <UNK> states the <UNK> budget was 15 million <UNK> say <UNK> million and considering they didn't use any name talent i would say the money did not show up on screen the monster is just repulsive and rarely looks deadly br br the last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character's actions by the time <UNK> and co have begun hunting grant the alien one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been <UNK> animals at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the <UNK> sheriff a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered and a local has been acting psychotic time to call the authorities but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and act br br although this movie is ostensibly a horror comedy the movie it bears the most resemblance to is <UNK> in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions whereas <UNK> had much bigger problems with story especially the entire morgan freeman subplot and particularly the ending in many ways it was stronger primarily because the main characters were stronger but more importantly because it looked beautiful although that may be <UNK> <UNK> the movie that is weaker in general plot and <UNK> spine because of production values that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of <UNK>
<START> the color purple is truly amazing there is none like it and i don't think there ever will be it's a roller <UNK> of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on the actors are flawless and the directing is superb i absolutely loved it a movie has never made me so happy it is beautiful that's the best way to explain it
<START> many king fans hate this because it <UNK> from the book but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump that notwithstanding the movie does fail completely but it fails entirely on film terms i'd like to <UNK> the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made i always follow up with the question really exactly what scene scared you every fan i've asked goes silent occasionally someone at a loss for a decent scare there are none names the <UNK> juice shooting out of <UNK> <UNK> if you're afraid of that i don't know what to tell you except maybe that you're easily scared i just rolled my eyes watching these z grade horror ideas play out in this <UNK> incoherent movie br br one place it <UNK> from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get mr <UNK> up to the overlook only to kill him with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that jack is waiting behind one of the <UNK> in the <UNK> that it takes <UNK> forever to walk down really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film br br oh and nice choice for mr <UNK> artwork stanley black light <UNK> <UNK> really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie has there ever been a more off out of place shot in any movie ever made br br i consider it a miracle that i was eventually able to <UNK> this turd and agree that <UNK> 2001 is a truly important film given the immense <UNK> <UNK> generated by both this stupid stupid movie and the cult of <UNK> but <UNK> kubrick fan boys who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with every film <UNK> in the library of <UNK> in front of them br br toss in the grotesque overacting of jack nicholson the introduction of dumb one liners at tense moments and the <UNK> nominated performance of <UNK> duvall and you have a very crappy movie
<START> what a stunning episode for this fine series this is television excellence at its best the story takes place in 1968 and it's beautifully filmed in black white almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images this is a story about two men who fall in love but i don't want to spoil this it is a rare presentation of what <UNK> faced in the 1960s in america written by the superb tom <UNK> and directed by the great <UNK> <UNK> we move through their lives their love for each other and their tragedy taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters chills ran up my spine at the end when they played bob <UNK> gorgeous ah but i was so much older then i'm younger than that now as sung by the <UNK> this one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars beautiful
<START> so your <UNK> are away on a sleep over the wife is visiting the mother in law you though are at home it's a dark and <UNK> night and there is no football on the telly and the <UNK> needs <UNK> so now what are you going to do br br i will tell you br br go make an old fashioned <UNK> <UNK> is best get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the dvd now go <UNK> and play arthur <UNK> world war two thriller horror the ghost train return to that comfortable <UNK> and enjoy the night in br br the ghost train is a genuine british war time classic arthur <UNK> with his side kick stinker <UNK> entertain you and i suspect the cast to a high <UNK> thrills and <UNK> espionage thriller it's set in old rural england during the second world war br br it <UNK> around a <UNK> group of people that need to stay overnight through circumstances outside any <UNK> control in an old <UNK> waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train br br the plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary br br the tale was written by that old boy <UNK> of <UNK> army fame and it is clever br br arthur <UNK> is entertaining and is very at home <UNK> his routines to you and the cast he also shows he can act a bit the cast are never out staged though even the <UNK> porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary <UNK> br br oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish <UNK>
<START> yes i was lucky enough to see the long running original production of michael <UNK> hit musical it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985 it is awful almost everything fails first off attenborough a fine actor a good director with the right material is a sorry choice almost as bad as when john huston was hired to <UNK> annie the camera is always in the wrong place they chop up the songs and the casting they are awful the power of the play was these dancers these hungry talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance you couldn't take your eyes off of them but this cast just gets by dancing does a nice job singing but none of them spark one bit in fact look up the cast on imdb none of them really went on to do anything much ok ok janet jones married <UNK> <UNK> so this cinema <UNK> does not capture for one second the magic the desperation the passion of the stage musical a total strike out but even though they try to <UNK> the music the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was
<START> a classic hollywood biopic is the best sense of the genre gooding and deniro both give spectacularly heartfelt performances in the two leads roles and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent with standout performances by carl <UNK> and michael <UNK> br br the only <UNK> i might pick is that <UNK> role was unnecessary distracting not her performance which was fine it's just that the film seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to <UNK> her role br br aside from that the characterizations dynamics and action of the real life story are riveting and unforgettable the <UNK> of the main characters and how what they experience <UNK> their beings are uniquely <UNK> by the performing artists despite the movie's extreme length the pacing stays intact throughout the score is also terrific br br us this a predictable hollywood film you bet so mike leigh <UNK> should <UNK> a star but everyone else should enjoy <UNK>
<START> this movie had a imdb rating of 8 1 so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is half way through it begins to drag and everything becomes <UNK> predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not real people at all this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale br br the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon
<START> if you see this turkey listed in your tv guide avoid it like the plague br br a steaming great pile of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't begin to describe how bad this movie is there is only one funny scene the memory <UNK> scene but even that rates only <UNK> on the <UNK> out of 1000 whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives
<START> the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwin br br the main protagonist antagonist jennifer <UNK> hart is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father baldwin however when she meets an ex con called nick ryan jeremy jordan never been <UNK> they instantly <UNK> for each other but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship she <UNK> him to kill her parents to protect their <UNK> but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad david <UNK> future <UNK> cast mate for hart melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil <UNK> and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year hart began portrayed sabrina the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television br br although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to <UNK> <UNK> that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called <UNK> darling or sabrina <UNK> br br i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina you can watch this on the internet so i suggest check it out
<START> romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england in this light hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in <UNK> the ladies were charming and elegant and the gentlemen dashing emma ' based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas <UNK> stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role a self <UNK> <UNK> emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing <UNK> and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend harriet toni collette but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying meanwhile her <UNK> are <UNK> by by the handsome mr knightley jeremy northam whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more <UNK> than <UNK> and lend some needed balance to the proceedings and emma so concerned with what is right for others <UNK> the heart that is actually the most important of all her own the world goes <UNK> and love <UNK> but emma is about to miss the boat luckily for her however the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings now if she can but stop long enough to realize it but as everyone who has known true love knows matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant depending upon the slightest thing and while romance is at hand for emma she must first recognize it and <UNK> the moment br br <UNK> has crafted and delivered a delightful feel good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often <UNK> world there may be an air of <UNK> about it but in retrospect this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is in all honesty to just about anyone love and with <UNK> impeccable sense of pace and timing it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable it's a pleasant affecting film with a wonderful cast that successfully <UNK> the viewer to another time and another place it's light fare but absorbing and the <UNK> settings and proceedings offer a sense of well being and calm that allows you to <UNK> yourself in it and simply go with the flow br br the <UNK> paltrow who won the oscar for best actress for shakespeare in <UNK> two years after making this one seems comfortable and right at home in this genre she <UNK> all things british and does it with such <UNK> and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether she's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner very reminiscent of audrey hepburn yet paltrow is unique as an actor she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated with such films as hard eight ' <UNK> and a perfect <UNK> that she can play just about any part effectively and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own but it's with characters like emma that she really shines she is so <UNK> and open and her personality is so engaging that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch regardless of the part she is playing and for emma she is absolutely perfect br br jeremy northam also <UNK> himself extremely well in the role of knightley and like paltrow seems suited to the genre in the right role that is his performance in the more recent the golden bowl ' in which he played an italian prince was less than satisfying here however he is perfect he is handsome and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real like colin <UNK> mr <UNK> in the miniseries pride and prejudice ' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr knightley br br also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette as <UNK> friend harriet smith and alan <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> respectively collette and <UNK> create characters who are very real people and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film and it demonstrates just how <UNK> the supporting players are in the world of the cinema and to films of any genre br br the supporting cast includes greta <UNK> mrs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mr <UNK> sophie thompson miss bates kathleen byron mrs <UNK> <UNK> law mrs bates polly walker jane <UNK> and ewan <UNK> frank <UNK> an uplifting elegant film <UNK> is a reminder of <UNK> behavior and the value of <UNK> and grace in a world too often <UNK> with <UNK> and even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this if only for a couple of hours as it <UNK> the need for that <UNK> of faith in the human spirit and that's the magic of the movies i rate this one 9 10 br br br br
<START> it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two <UNK> who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but don't give up on it nothing much happens but the time passes <UNK> and there are numerous sly jokes my favorite is the <UNK> ride in the storm which i find hilarious the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful as is polly walker and the <UNK> in the movie are very satisfying br br the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> business but i actually preferred the movie's version of this it may be more sentimental but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story and anyway i like sentiment when it's well done br br an excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather
<START> i recently saw the broadway revival of <UNK> spirit starring angela lansbury rupert everett christine <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> it's a terrific production and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect angela lansbury is extremely funny as <UNK> <UNK> br br it was probably a mistake then to check out the film version of the play starring rex harrison the movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production br br <UNK> spirit is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast in an audience full of people who have come to laugh the actors can <UNK> give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines and involve the audience on a personal level that you can't get in a movie house or with a dvd showing where the audience is separated from the story by the fourth wall the story charles <UNK> rex harrison a successful writer lives with his wife ruth <UNK> <UNK> in a house in the english countryside seeking information for his next book a book dealing with the supernatural charles invites <UNK> <UNK> margaret <UNK> <UNK> her role from the original 1941 london production a local spiritual medium over to his house to conduct a <UNK> charles believes that <UNK> is a <UNK> but hopes to pick up the tricks of the trade but then <UNK> <UNK> brings back the ghost of elvira <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> first wife who died of <UNK> seven years ago elvira refuses to leave and develops a spitting rivalry with ruth over charles complicated by the fact that only charles can see or hear elvira br br on stage the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation but on the screen the actors in <UNK> spirit tear through the lines as if they don't know that anyone is listening to them they <UNK> lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage the performances by harrison <UNK> and even <UNK> <UNK> are flat and lifeless only margaret <UNK> seems to have <UNK> her spark and humor as <UNK> <UNK> br br the oscar winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive not just by today's standards but by the standards of 1946 they consist mostly of <UNK> <UNK> walking around in <UNK> green outfits and makeup being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost br br the cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting but compare the dull visual effects of <UNK> spirit to the truly groundbreaking effects in disney's song of the south which was <UNK> for awards the same year in south humans and animated characters share the screen <UNK> for minutes at a time compared to south the oscar that <UNK> spirit received for special effects was completely <UNK> br br at any rate i can only encourage you to catch the broadway revival of this play with angela lansbury before it <UNK> as for the movie with rex harrison skip it
<START> this is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in <UNK> by or suffering from an eating disorder it is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of <UNK> in a teenage girl its causes and its <UNK> the girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today alison <UNK> who was later so spectacular in <UNK> the truth <UNK> i would recommend that this film be shown in all schools as you will never see a better on this subject alison <UNK> is absolutely outstanding and one <UNK> at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this <UNK> disorder if <UNK> tell us the air pressure alison <UNK> tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy her emotional range is so precise each scene could be <UNK> <UNK> for its <UNK> of trauma on a scale of rising <UNK> and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity <UNK> <UNK> is the perfect choice to play her mother and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as <UNK> together they make a pair of sensitive emotional <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> with one another this film is really an astonishing achievement and director <UNK> <UNK> should be proud of it the only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people but even if you like nature films best this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge <UNK> is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair and if we don't <UNK> with people suffering from the depths of despair then we are dead inside
<START> the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great 30 days tv series in mind but also counting in his mtv production i bet you will that <UNK> his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production <UNK> me i did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with <UNK> me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the <UNK> gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end
<START> this is one fine movie i can watch it any time <UNK> julia gave an outstanding performance we lost him too soon richard <UNK> is a great talent only thing it needed more of was dana <UNK> what a babe
<START> i was expecting a documentary that focused on the <UNK> industry in north <UNK> instead i watched a man who <UNK> the fact that his great grandfather lost his <UNK> empire to the duke family and this went on and on if mr <UNK> family had <UNK> over the dukes i doubt that mr <UNK> would have any problems with the death <UNK> caused by <UNK> related <UNK> i grew up near the area where mr <UNK> family began it <UNK> business i expected more than <UNK> <UNK> focus on his family i learned very little about the history of <UNK> in the <UNK> economy and the <UNK> to the <UNK> economy by <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> the countless references to the movie bright leaves are out of place so what if gary cooper played mr <UNK> great grandfather does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of <UNK> in the north <UNK> economy by the showing of old film clips of a <UNK> film i didn't
<START> a <UNK> story of a martian attempt to <UNK> earth things must be pretty bad back on mars two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported <UNK> crash whatever landed is buried under the ice at <UNK> pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner br br the diner has had no customers since eleven <UNK> that morning now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for <UNK> to cross a <UNK> weak bridge the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus although he didn't notice who they were the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be <UNK> one of them is an alien but which one all of them are suspect there's the crazy old man jack <UNK> of course who seems to exercise a sub <UNK> wit there's a <UNK> businessman who must get to boston john <UNK> a young couple on their honeymoon <UNK> performance by the husband ron <UNK> except for the couples nobody has noticed anyone else and even the couples are suspicious of each other bride to newly <UNK> husband i could have <UNK> you had a mole on your <UNK> the story continues in a <UNK> but slightly spooky way the phone rings for no reason the lights go on and off the <UNK> box turns itself on and none of it is to be taken seriously br br it's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle there is no discernible depth to it it's not a moral message about <UNK> people <UNK> as normal citizens it's not a warning of any kind just a fairy tale that <UNK> and <UNK> br br i always enjoy it when it's on it's especially interesting to see john <UNK> as the <UNK> and <UNK> businessman knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who <UNK> the assassination of <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> version of shakespeare's play and here he is with three arms br br <UNK>
<START> filmed by mgm on the same sets as the english version but in german <UNK> second portrayal of anna christie <UNK> from practice and her apparent ease with german dialog garbo appears more relaxed and natural under jacques <UNK> direction than under clarence <UNK> and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared which made her transition to sound complete the strength she brought to the character remains here although it has been <UNK> and garbo reveals more of <UNK> vulnerability the entire cast with the exception of garbo is different from the previous version of the film and garbo benefits from not having to compete with marie <UNK> who stole every scene she was in during the english language version in <UNK> film garbo holds the center of attention throughout although the three supporting players particularly the father gave excellent performances br br <UNK> direction was more assured than clarence <UNK> and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as <UNK> by the new sound process as did those of brown the film moves with more <UNK> than the english language adaptation and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest even william daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the brown version he captured <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> with style also the screenplay adaptation for the european audience made <UNK> profession quite clear from the start and the <UNK> <UNK> for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the brown filming however the film was made before the production code was introduced which made the censorship puzzling br br <UNK> oscar nomination for anna christie was always somewhat <UNK> and i suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance however some of the academy voters may have seen the german language version of the film and they realized as will contemporary viewers that her anna christie under <UNK> direction was definitely oscar worthy
<START> i can't add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here great acting balanced writing multi <UNK> characters a great anti hero in tony great commentary on <UNK> american life the integral use of <UNK> coupled with tony's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous several other characters add a lot of depth <UNK> interesting history as an <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> total <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> desires in life and so on br br i have to dig into some of the criticisms however especially the <UNK> <UNK> violence <UNK> italian <UNK> one most of the writers and actors are italian american would they attack themselves there are several positive italian american characters <UNK> <UNK> the chef dr <UNK> and her family and the <UNK> next door to the sopranos indeed dr <UNK> ex husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of italian americans have ever had mob connections certainly smaller than the <UNK> of african americans involved in crime dare i say it in both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes br br most of the characters don't really choose the life they have family background or circumstances largely corner them into it <UNK> even of italian stock who attempt to <UNK> into it usually meet <UNK> ends matthew and his friend in season 2 for example if you <UNK> this show i assume <UNK> made you want to be a psychiatrist or will grace made you want to go homosexual presumably you won't listen to rap music that <UNK> gangs or <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> or rock music which <UNK> drugs or any other combination people aren't as stupid as some of you make out br br not everything is perfect however a lot of characters have only appeared once when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes <UNK> the dancer <UNK> friend ally uncle <UNK> <UNK> supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1
<START> steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 year old virgin having only had supporting roles in such films as <UNK> bruce almighty anchorman and his work on the daily show we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own you can tell that will ferrell influenced his comedic air but carell takes it to another level everything he does is innocent lovable and hilarious i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our time br br the 40 year old virgin is two hours of non stop laughs or 4 hours if you see it twice like i did a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all the music fit the tone of the movie great and you can tell the director knew what he was doing br br filled with sex jokes some nudity and a lot of language this movie isn't for everyone but if you liked the wedding <UNK> anchorman or any movie along those lines you will absolutely love the 40 year old virgin
<START> well i just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than little britain and i like it the league of gentlemen is a sick british comedy that is about the most awful insane and disgusting small town in all the uk this place makes <UNK> and <UNK> island from the <UNK> of <UNK> and father ted seem pretty normal the format of the show is a lot like little britain except that all of it centers around the <UNK> of this one <UNK> town both shows feature the same skits again and again every episode and some obviously inspired little britain particularly the job seeking class skit but the show <UNK> because although it is crude like little britain hence not a show for kids the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows in particular animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show br br now if you haven't guessed this is not a show for kids the easily offended or normal people and that's probably why i liked it however you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max funny and incredibly <UNK> beyond belief you have to see it to believe it
<START> a still famous but <UNK> actor morgan freeman has not filmed for four years when he is invited to participate in a new project he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor latin neighborhood in <UNK> to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket he sees the gorgeous spanish <UNK> scarlet paz vega and he becomes attracted with her ability his driver never returns to catch him and scarlet gives a ride to the actor but first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time br br i am a big fan of morgan freeman and paz vega however the pointless 10 items or less is absolutely disappointing this low budget movie does not seem to have a storyline and is supported by the chemistry and <UNK> of morgan freeman and paz vega and actually nothing happens along <UNK> minutes the ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous with the character of morgan freeman returning to his silver <UNK> world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family or was a clash of classes and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes my vote is four br br title brazil um <UNK> em <UNK> <UNK> a star in my life
<START> this movie is using cinematography fantastically the depth of the camera catches each character denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though <UNK> accent does die in certain scenes how is this movie laying forgotten unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever a worrying idea attenborough at his best since <UNK> this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african apartheid though <UNK> for the biased nature the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world <UNK> and peace
<START> i loved this movie it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it but it is really very uplifting i was struck by the performance of ray liotta but especially the talent of tom <UNK> portraying <UNK> twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event but <UNK> character though heartbreaking knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life this is a great movie don't miss it
<START> with a title borrowed from <UNK> <UNK> and liberal <UNK> of kubrick <UNK> and <UNK> it is painfully obvious that thomas clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our british cinema <UNK> out robert <UNK> for short sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the iraq war the problem with the realism is that the characters are so <UNK> unrealistic and <UNK> contrary to the <UNK> <UNK> of extreme filmmakers most teenagers are not drug <UNK> <UNK> as a critique of the iraq war a film about youth violence by a talented classical musician subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual is so <UNK> as to hardly bear thinking about there are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have <UNK> this like kubrick and <UNK> he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film people liked clockwork orange and <UNK> because they liked the rapes and the violence but most of all they liked feeling <UNK> superior for liking things that most hated so too much kubrick and not enough <UNK> a serious and moral filmmaker here <UNK> this as one of the most moronic films in years i am not against violence in film to do it seriously is a hard trick though people in cinemas <UNK> alex in clockwork orange showing how kubrick's supposed intent was missed by miles gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the <UNK> of many art film directors
<START> scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films for there is not much of a plot bad acting pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes but and this is a big but there is one good actor one good recurring joke and a good beginning the good actor being tim <UNK> the one good recurring joke is the creepy weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does <UNK> but laugh worthy things and the good beginning is the spoof of the <UNK> br br the plot to scary movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion but will they survive the night this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it
<START> this is by far my favorite film of all time that's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics such as <UNK> and female <UNK> that other mainstream films are just too <UNK> to touch nothing seems to be off limits in this film as the director <UNK> develops the story without any concern given to possibly <UNK> the viewer however i don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to <UNK> offend anyone sean young turns in an excellent and courageous performance most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it the other cast members do a fine job as well br br have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters have you ever wondered why the obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere it seems quite ironic to me that some <UNK> channels now carry <UNK> porn that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn but will not carry a mainstream movie like love crimes sadly even though this movie is only 11 years old it could probably not be made today br br
<START> and this somebody is me and not only me as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater why did the people love it it's obvious everybody knows zombies by now at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the dawn of the dead <UNK> or resident evil movies etc br br or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies that is until this movie came along and you'll see zombies in a new light perhaps this is not a horror movie although it does contain some violent scenes but is rather a comedy a satire to be precise and it never runs out of steam that is why i rated it so high pacing wise it's incredible the acting is great and the script has no obvious mistakes quite the contrary it's a gem and if you're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it and even if you dislike them watch it because it's a great comedy movie
<START> though frank <UNK> songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer they're <UNK> by joseph l <UNK> <UNK> staging and uninspired presentation when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical <UNK> doesn't seem to know how to present <UNK> challenging but <UNK> <UNK> for maximum effect for example one of the best numbers the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> concludes by having <UNK> vivian <UNK> belt out the finale while sitting on a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> faux spiritual sit down you're <UNK> the <UNK> has his backing choir sitting in <UNK> <UNK> while he simply stands there <UNK> <UNK> all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue adapted from <UNK> <UNK> stage book has none of the wit that his films like all about <UNK> have part of the blame has to go to the leads just about all of whom are miscast marlon brando looks <UNK> as to why he's in a musical frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential the songs are not <UNK> to his style and jean simmons barely <UNK> the way a shirley jones might only <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> our attention like a broadway pro should the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard <UNK> created the flashy sets
<START> antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece this time on the other side of the atlantic than blow up it <UNK> the success with critics and youth like the former though why maybe because it was a <UNK> view of america filled with clichés that <UNK> work then and that have not aged well the revolutionary students at the beginning is embarrassing br br maybe when it was released big blockbuster movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed dated if it had been released a year before maybe <UNK> in <UNK> would have seemed fresh it´s a very interesting film tho very beautifully shot with some brilliant and <UNK> scenes in between like the love making in the desert the <UNK> of the desert mansion and the explosive ending that the leads were two amateurs <UNK> help they were beautiful but inexperienced mark <UNK> is slightly better than daria <UNK> it would have been so much better with proper actors maybe michelle phillips or a young jessica lange the dialog is actually quite funny and poignant at times tho you <UNK> know the way the lines are delivered br br a very <UNK> document of the late sixties definitely worth a look for the photography and the soundtrack
<START> the <UNK> were not very kind to one time major star charles bronson starting with <UNK> death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome film from <UNK> <UNK> screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in <UNK> <UNK> d w ii left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of <UNK> character's daughter a rape and murder of his <UNK> was also shown in disgusting detail 10 to midnight was the sort of <UNK> film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeeming about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period <UNK> the line between high camp and high <UNK> with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge i'm not sure if the producers usually <UNK> <UNK> got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizen aged bronson destroying <UNK> young enough to be his <UNK> or what but the shoddy <UNK> and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated br br <UNK> the last of these films is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic <UNK> in this film bronson <UNK> a perverse john forces a <UNK> to eat his <UNK> watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly <UNK> remarks among other things i've thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gang rape of a young japanese girl fortunately this was off screen though well implied br br what were people thinking when they made this film what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films for anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the <UNK> and <UNK> like the mechanic death wish from <UNK> <UNK> 3 once upon a time in the west red sun the great escape the magnificent seven rider on the rain etc etc
<START> this was one of those times when i had nothing to do with 27 <UNK> movie channels available to me the theory of flight grabbed me and held my interest i found it both touching and amusing a nice combination of feelings i recommend it
<START> this film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an <UNK> lou <UNK> disease <UNK> the subject is done with compassion as well as humor helena bonham carter is so convincing as a person with <UNK> that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting kenneth branagh a superb actor lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who <UNK> and is forced to provide <UNK> to <UNK> character as part of his community service an alternative to prison time watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end <UNK> fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances one comes to care deeply for the two of them
<START> incredibly artistic nobody could make them now i think it seem to be perfect the biggest and the greatest musical ever made listen to the beautiful songs the are quite poetry i'm italian and admired by american musical why can't you do something like that now american were the best and for that i absolutely show my devotion to you with this movie there are words to describes the perfection of this movie all of a sudden my heart sings what makes the sunset i fall in love to easily jealousy and the scene with tom and jerry the greatest without <UNK> if you you doesn't know your eyes are not open my friends you must see it and appreciate wake up
<START> viewing <UNK> is a very satisfying experience unpredictable films are such a <UNK> when one comes along like <UNK> it is something to embrace the script is logical and extremely creative meg <UNK> tim <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and bill paxton give believable performances this could have played out like a zombie movie but <UNK> is far superior to any boring <UNK> and originality shines through in almost every scene you get the feeling that something like this could have actually happened even though the script is pure fiction from the <UNK> opening till the credits roll you will be fascinated very entertaining and definitely recommended <UNK>
<START> there are so many hollywood movies made now that are not only torture to watch but also have no bearing on anyone's life whatsoever granted movies don't always have to have deep meaning but it's nice to know that there are still film makers out there who care about telling human stories i won't give away the premise of this brilliant film however the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones i have ever seen in my life and i'm a <UNK> year old film buff too bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites which includes on the <UNK> sunset <UNK> and black <UNK> to name just a few this moving movie should become one of your favorites also that is if you have a heart
<START> 1st watched 6 18 2009  2 out of 10 <UNK> pete <UNK> weird psychotic movie about a girl with <UNK> who is being tested in a hospital the power <UNK> and then all hell breaks loose i'm honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one what we get for the next 1 hour and a half at least it wasn't longer was a twisted horror twilight zone <UNK> ghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end initially after the power goes out everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of <UNK> including the girl and his father there is the typical annoying character a creepy old man and the typical tough guy similar to many <UNK> and of course the young girl the main character gets attracted to random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing a <UNK> that time has stopped and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever they're in of course the <UNK> girl is the center of everything somehow and i really hate how they used this girl's <UNK> and <UNK> that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame we never really find out the answer to what was going <UNK> is very strange so please avoid this dog unless you want to be <UNK> out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any <UNK> what a waste of <UNK>
<START> ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001 secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much it was bizarre and badly filmed the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand i love chinese epic films but if you're looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise visually stunning the plot is interesting and good character development not this film beware you will be disappointed
<START> keep in mind i'm a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time how i've overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me to me this is a better film then the much <UNK> high <UNK> it's a great western with excellent acting and a great story the dvd is in <UNK> black and white with outstanding cinematography if you like westerns or james stewart this film is not to be missed
<START> the night evelyn came out of the grave <UNK> <UNK> italy 1971 br br i only watched this delirious piece of euro <UNK> in the way of <UNK> <UNK> dreadful dvd release looks like an extremely bad video transfer but from what i saw not nearly interesting enough to purchase no <UNK> recent dvd release considering their excellent track record it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases and don't pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here it's not taken from this film some girl holding the head of a jim carrey look a like br br spaghetti western star anthony <UNK> sports a hip <UNK> and assumes the role of lord alan cunningham a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife evelyn this leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being <UNK> in a psychiatric clinic once released cunningham channels this trauma by taking <UNK> prostitutes to his countryside castle <UNK> them to vicious acts of torture his doctor and friend richard <UNK> what do you mean italian horror names sound made up <UNK> him to forget the past and <UNK> but cunningham is obsessed with evelyn and even <UNK> a <UNK> at the castle eventually after killing some more girls he meets <UNK> another <UNK> and marries her almost immediately but the arrival of his new wife <UNK> a series of sinister events <UNK> creatures strike at sir <UNK> family killing them off one by one becoming more <UNK> cunningham visits <UNK> tomb and discovers it to be empty soon a number of <UNK> begin to suspect something <UNK> is going on in the castle and lord <UNK> treatment might not have been that successful after all br br director <UNK> <UNK> tries to blend gothic horror with giallo conventions with limited success as usual not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in england the cars drive on the right side of the road everyone looks very <UNK> and the castle and the rest of the architecture is <UNK> italian this is common practice in italian horror but sometimes they just take this a little too far the bad print made this even slightly bearable since it's so dark you couldn't see much of the surroundings anyway but then again this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality isn't really the issue a large part consists of <UNK> <UNK> torture scenes in the castle torture chamber but most of the time anthony <UNK> <UNK> his way through this and shows some horrible over acting i guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you're in the right mood i just couldn't take it at least not with the print i watched a pleasant score though by bruno <UNK> which combines easy listening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbers br br camera <UNK> 4 10
<START> i really hate most end of the world movies they show what jaded hollywood people think of the rest of the world and they clearly think we're a bunch of sadistic idiots or at least that watching sadistic idiots react to things is somehow entertaining i've been to l a many times i have family that works in show business and i just want to say that these are the last people we should be looking to for a reality check some disaster movies at least paint a clever picture children of men 12 monkeys but usually the message is just people will do anything to survive all is dark and sad and <UNK> we should all be ashamed of ourselves br br don't get me wrong i like the idea of a story that explores throwing off the system of social order and testing people's <UNK> in the face of horror and i do believe some people would act like this film portrayed but sadistic idiots aside i seriously doubt society would just <UNK> into every man for himself that's just insulting
<START> ok i taped this off tv and missed the very start the film was about 10 or so seconds into the titles i assume so if anything happened before that i missed it br br lots of people say mark <UNK> is in this i didn't see him i did <UNK> clive barker john <UNK> and obviously stephen king doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendant br br alice <UNK> looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien make up br br even with the opening titles it's never really explained very well exactly what <UNK> are or where they come from from the title sequence i assume they are <UNK> <UNK> who live by <UNK> life force from humans i assume they live a long time and these particular 2 are possibly the last of their kind br br add to this a very large dose of incest yes i thought it was a bit suspect too <UNK> killer cats and <UNK> and you have <UNK> br br it's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main 2 characters and far too many <UNK> to try and distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewer br br avoid
<START> <UNK> <UNK> 2006 br br directed by jared <UNK> br br starring jack black <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> darius rose br br mpaa rating pg 13 for some rough action and crude humor including dialog br br say what you will about it i know some people who despise it to no end but i have always thought that <UNK> dynamite was a funny movie not the <UNK> brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless jack black is also a very funny man irritating at times yes and <UNK> overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree so i was very happy to hear that jared <UNK> the writer and director of <UNK> dynamite and jack black would be <UNK> up for a movie about a spanish <UNK> who becomes a wrestler to save an <UNK> my only <UNK> was that the plot seemed a little too thin unfortunately my one <UNK> turned out to be downfall of the entire movie this plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as saturday night live or possibly even mad tv would have worked <UNK> unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the <UNK> one and a half hour runtime and this one joke comedy falls flat br br <UNK> was raised in a mexican monastery and became a <UNK> man of the lord feeling <UNK> by the entire monastery <UNK> black now the <UNK> cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler as the <UNK> <UNK> hit an all time low <UNK> decides to join a <UNK> <UNK> so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the <UNK> <UNK> this plot sounds so sweet and caring it seems like the perfect movie for jack black look what he did with school of rock after all well to my <UNK> this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie it is again hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid <UNK> course for all i know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie watching an <UNK> woman <UNK> like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie a seven year old could make up the same joke br br the performances in <UNK> <UNK> are actually good jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical unfortunately this movie just wasn't enough for him it didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him i had never seen or heard of <UNK> de la <UNK> before but now i can say that not only is she quite talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever <UNK> my <UNK> she just <UNK> in the role and it worked wonderfully well <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> bumbling partner <UNK> kept me laughing continuously he did a very nice job and it was very effective when <UNK> with that of jack <UNK> darius rose who plays an orphan named <UNK> didn't have many lines but what can i say i just enjoyed him he was adorable the rest of the cast did their job it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub par movie br br <UNK> <UNK> just does not work its plot is stretched far too thin the heart of it all is <UNK> by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work i very rarely laughed and if i did it was because of jack black or another member of the cast and that leads me to the bright side of <UNK> <UNK> yes the cast this cast was <UNK> for lack of a better word they were on they all <UNK> had excellent chemistry together and <UNK> as much life as possible into the flat script after jared <UNK> <UNK> dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie i was surprised to find myself so often bored with <UNK> <UNK> something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was all i know is that <UNK> <UNK> is not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless there is a small reason to watch if only to watch jack black work but if you are not a fan of jack black then avoid this movie like the plague i like black but i am done with this movie and with this review br br final thought <UNK> this is jared <UNK> surprisingly disappointing follow up to his hysterical <UNK> dynamite br br overall rating 4 10 c
<START> the writers probably had no experience in the army and probably never <UNK> at a history book but i still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war br br the action is confused and unbelievable any episode of combat has better production values but the cast is interesting seeing new york giant <UNK> <UNK> was worth the buck i paid for this the art direction is fifth rate the men wear korean war uniforms and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the u s army reached germany in 1944 not sunny as they show here and i don't think the <UNK> <UNK> northern california the script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers there is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying <UNK> <UNK> instead of m <UNK> which second rate troops probably would have been <UNK> with br br this basic story idea racist southern officer commanding black troops should have been expanded into a big budget production back then and its not too late to try it now you have to take this for what it is and i admire the creators of this film for making the effort br br i remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in italy which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944
<START> did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last oh my god it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy not <UNK> and epic like the entire run of the show has been most reviews have read have been glowing but i really can't understand why i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then <UNK> it because i thought no they would never do that that's far too lame i can hardly stand it i feel so <UNK> i think i'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own someone please change my mind i want to love this so bad someone tell me why i'm wrong great show terrible ending
<START> in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and king arthur on dvds chosen by others for an <UNK> entertainment and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie watching public totally lacks <UNK> and is content as long as they get action both movies were utter rubbish br br whatever happened to character development whatever happened to meaningful dialogue whatever happened to acting and when watching something that vaguely <UNK> to be historical whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy some realistic idea of the political map of the time even some slight <UNK> of the era especially in its social attitudes why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america i have read on the message boards of <UNK> that little was known of the dark ages not so considerable amounts are known with much learned <UNK> on the era but these <UNK> simply couldn't be bothered to do any <UNK> br br i only wish i could vote 0 10
<START> a very high standard columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long running series but was originally <UNK> second after murder by the book br br robert <UNK> makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency who <UNK> the wife patricia <UNK> of a rich highly influential businessman played very <UNK> by ray <UNK> after he <UNK> a report in her favour after it is discovered she was having an affair the wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage br br a very satisfying episode in many respects particularly as the plot is so strongly set up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare columbo <UNK> that the crime is an <UNK> killing the whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed husband uses the murderer to assist columbo in his <UNK> a feature that <UNK> numerous good quality scenes particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> qualities are wonderfully in evidence br br directed with flair by bernard l <UNK> and acted to an appropriately high level this really set the tone for whole series since murder by the book was let down by a poor ending the script by columbo creators richard <UNK> and william link is precise well structured and well thought out and is <UNK> by a steady <UNK> pace and meaningful sequences which really exhibit the <UNK> of the story ultimately the finale <UNK> <UNK> that columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer br br overall this is a very fine piece of detective work for columbo and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and <UNK> to render a polished columbo story
<START> always enjoy great films which deal with the super natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world however this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen the actors namely mark <UNK> thomas <UNK> gave an outstanding performance in his native land england and we have seen him in still standing a tv series heath ledger played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in <UNK> mountain <UNK> gave a great supporting role <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> did a good job of <UNK> a priest from a church not recognized by any faith don't waste your time you will be sorry
<START> stupid stupid stupid i can not stand ben stiller anymore how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me i can't understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i'd get fired and i own the company i would have to fire myself god this movie was just a plain steaming <UNK> pile of poo that needs to be <UNK> if that were possible something else i have to say the <UNK> about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary
<START> <UNK> is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i've ever seen the name of the film can be translated in english as the sword <UNK> the main hero <UNK> was born with one exceptional ability he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings but it is not about <UNK> he hardly can be even called the anti hero i think he is just a person who lost the <UNK> in his life and faith in good justice and love in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him except his mother every his step is <UNK> with blood he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a <UNK> for him and suddenly he meets her she doesn't need the <UNK> talks and explanations she loves him for what he is she doesn't care what he did the fact that he's next to her is more important than anything else but soon she finds out his secret he kills two people her ex boyfriend and his bodyguard to protect her before her very eyes even after that she couldn't escape her feelings they try to run but it's hart to hide finally they have a serious car accident he is <UNK> she is in a mental hospital they don't know anything about each other but she believes that he'll save her he <UNK> a lot of obstacles but finally finds her they run again but they aren't <UNK> she is wounded she needs a rest but police almost catch them he doesn't know what to do they drive into a corner and then his sword begins to cut down trees helicopter around them but there is no need for it because she is already dead in his arms and he is the lonely person in the whole world again
<START> man on fire tells a story of an ex special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of <UNK> for <UNK> at first he's not to friendly but then they <UNK> with each other he decides to stop drinking etc etc then one day she gets kidnapped and killed br br and he won't stop at anything to get the revenge br br that's basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry br br that's also because of the great music harry <UNK> williams with lisa <UNK> gladiator composed br br but the strongest part of the movie wait the thing is everything here is perfect br br first acting denzel washington is at his best mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always great <UNK> mitchell and amazing young <UNK> fanning and that's not the end of the list br br then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing should have won an oscar for sure br br the story is not just a revenge movie the story is intelligent the story makes you think and is pure beautiful really br br this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime at least once
<START> there really isn't much to say about this movie it's crude but fun br br plot outline from imdb br br br br two losers from <UNK> coop <UNK> parker stone <UNK> a new game playing basketball using baseball rules when the game becomes a huge success they along with a <UNK> help form the professional baseketball league where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities coop <UNK> team the <UNK> beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the dallas <UNK> vaughn wants to <UNK> br br br br the acting is pretty good since there <UNK> many big stars in this movie although i am not a big fan of <UNK> parker and stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie br br there are so many funny moments in this movie i can't come close to <UNK> them all it never really lets up and they don't try to put some <UNK> drama in to make it more serious br br and my favorite aspect of this movie the soundtrack it's great i especially like take me on and beer by reel big fish very underrated br br overall a crude but extremely funny movie 10 10 br br james black wolf <UNK>
<START> if one sits down to watch unhinged it is probably because its <UNK> video boxes whatever scream that it was banned in the uk for over 20 years as virtually every video nasty does it's true exploitation and taboo <UNK> people and draws them in with their promise of controversy being an exploitation fan however none of this was new to me the <UNK> that scream that the film was banned in the uk don't necessarily make me want to watch it in fact the first thing that usually pops into my head is how <UNK> paranoid british censors are how i came to viewing this then is simple it promised gore and it was only 6 99 the price alone <UNK> me not to have any hopes of this being the next halloween but a cheap padding of your dvd collection never hurts i did force myself however to watch it all in one sitting because i find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it so anyway after 90 minutes of unhinged i found that i had come across the <UNK> sleeping aid in existence i think the <UNK> could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing technique br br the <UNK> of unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s there's unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore that's about it anyway it starts with a group of three attractive co <UNK> crashing their car on the way to a concert though two of them terry and nancy are okay one gloria is severely injured and is out of <UNK> for the rest of the movie they are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion that happens to have no phone of course with rather strange <UNK> marion is a middle aged woman with a man hating mother who constantly <UNK> marion of <UNK> men into the house in order to sleep with them echoes of psycho she also happens to have a crazy brother carl who lives in the woods because her mother's hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house after hanging with marion for awhile terry our hero and nancy decide they must contact their parents despite everyone's <UNK> nancy <UNK> the dangerous woods to make it to a phone her fate is not hard to predict after that we see gloria again who is then promptly butchered with an <UNK> when terry discovers that gloria has disappeared from her room she decides something isn't right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends that may be easier said than done however with crazy carl lurking <UNK> br br after viewing unhinged i read an overwhelming number of reviews <UNK> that unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end normally i do not drag other people's opinions into my reviews especially when they <UNK> my views but in this case i was so puzzled by their reactions that i thought it would be relevant to mention this is because in <UNK> the film <UNK> normally for the slow building <UNK> to work the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger oh sure we see two of them get murdered but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom we are aware that there's a killer on the loose but this is only focused on three times in the film that means there's no reason to fear for the victims instead the film's events are explained not by the actions of the characters but are drawn out for us by <UNK> talking if there's one thing i can assure you from watching this it's that scenes of characters merely <UNK> with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious none of this is helped by the atrocious acting it seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experience br br of course i'd be a liar if i said there wasn't one part of the movie that i enjoyed specifically the ending was one of the best i've ever seen in a slasher film you just do not expect that to happen just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular ah i won't spoil it for you nor will i say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow moving film but it definitely will get your attention other than that the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material but it's not like you couldn't tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed however those are the only scenes of gore present that and of course no one scene can save an entire movie i normally <UNK> the <UNK> that as long as there's action the worse a movie is the better it gets unhinged only <UNK> one part of this concept the whole film just feels luke warm there's potential alright but the director either wasn't experienced enough to make it work or just didn't know what the hell he was doing
<START> have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and <UNK> life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own with one of your closest friends at your side facing all sorts of dangers and villains and <UNK> the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy lover have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again and not have a care in the world for just a couple of hours br br this is exactly what miyazaki's castle in the sky is all about <UNK> a young but very brave and ambitious engineer lives a <UNK> life in a mining town until one day a girl named <UNK> falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds while all the while they have pirates and military <UNK> hot on their trail simply put it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another and i can't help but feel my <UNK> melt away every time i see it br br as it is one of miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as spirited away <UNK> moving castle or even princess <UNK> still i find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other because all three of those films are at some point or another mystical to the point of being enigmatic if not <UNK> especially for the youngest of viewers br br castle in the sky on the other hand doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind and it's not a coming of age story either it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind i've ever seen not only is the artwork beautiful but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing whether it's the <UNK> up of the camera to see the enormous trees or clouds <UNK> or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air i just can't help but feel like i'm there with <UNK> and <UNK> just a kid in another world far far away from reality br br even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like <UNK> san or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> angel having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start as the film progresses more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions not only are they an adorable reminder of who i used to be but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film only growing stronger all the way to the last frame for that reason i've fallen in love with the two of them more than i have with any other miyazaki couple br br at the same time castle in the sky is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual <UNK> you may be you'll be sure to find your fix here mystery action drama comedy suspense sci fi romance even some western it's all here just about everything people go to the movies for except maybe horror this why i can easily recommend it as a first miyazaki film it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible <UNK> of some of his more recent works br br even the ending song of the film when translated into english conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization and some kind of soul mate that could not be found in our mundane lives the reason i long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them the earth <UNK> carrying you carrying us both <UNK> surely meet miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of joe <UNK> gorgeous scores but this is the only one i've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream i have found myself near tears just listening to it br br castle in the sky may not be miyazaki's most developed spectacular or meaningful work but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be a true vision of childhood fantasy and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just <UNK> little kids sit back relax and love it for what it is
<START> while hollywood got sort of <UNK> during the few years after wwii england developed a very prolific film industry in the man in the white suit <UNK> sidney <UNK> alec guinness creates a suit that never gets dirty unfortunately this means that certain other <UNK> are now likely to go out of business how can sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity this is an example of one of the great movies in which alec guinness starred before he became <UNK> wan <UNK> it's a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world if you're planning to start any kind of business you might want to consider watching this movie
<START> i'll be honest this is one of the worst movies ever if not then it's very close ever seen a bad teen soap opera well this is like one of those except worse for example possibly spoiler girl i wanna go somewhere else br br guy all we need is here br br girl but i wanna take myself somewhere different br br guy i'll take you somewhere else br br <UNK> this line they have sex the music is bad pop and bad punk rock if you've ever read the book avoid this movie like the plague they completely change the personalities of the characters and the events additionally they just get rid of things also the movie ends about before the book finishes it is an awful movie so if you haven't read the book don't watch it if you have read the book burn it the movie if you like stupid teen soap operas that are lower quality than your average low quality teen soap opera go for it then again should we expect anything different from mtv
<START> this movie is great mind you but only in the way it tells a very bad story stella is so terribly crude and never learns better her husband is incredibly <UNK> and small minded neither ever learns better is this realistic somehow stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her <UNK> manners dress yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down i don't think so stella is a good woman and a very good mother giving up herself so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> is disgusting br br much of what we see might have been normal for the times people having a beer or two enjoying a player piano dancing but it is made out to be some sort of moral <UNK> i can't have our child living this way spare me br br this story tells me one thing that the <UNK> working class cannot ever hope to <UNK> to the heights of the upper classes and that is simply a load of <UNK>
<START> two <UNK> shop workers in a leather goods store turn out to be secret <UNK> as they <UNK> under box number <UNK> within this simple idea and an everyday setting lubitsch produces a rich <UNK> of wit drama <UNK> and irony that never lets up stewart and <UNK> are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions and the rest of the well developed characters have their own sub plots and in jokes although wrongly <UNK> by stewart's big films of <UNK> 40 <UNK> philadelphia story mr smith this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting <UNK> unseen in the other films
<START> this really doesn't match up to castle of <UNK> <UNK> isn't as funny or wacky or as <UNK> the scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting br br the only good thing about this <UNK> is the nudity only in the uncut version provided by <UNK> it helped spice up some of the tedious scenes <UNK> had a <UNK> villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set pieces the locations in <UNK> are not very vivid or engaging br br <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> don't even provide decent <UNK> entertainment this time it's like they were just filling a <UNK> <UNK> by appearing br br the dvd is in full frame with <UNK> <UNK> sound it has a decent amount of extras including quite a few trailers but one curious thing there is no chapter selection on the disc or <UNK> displayed on the player once inserted though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote
<START> drew barrymore plays young holly gooding who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter patrick <UNK> george <UNK> and completely <UNK> his life by claiming that her <UNK> or evil twin is out to kill her and her family br br this silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously even if the film makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious <UNK> is muddled with some <UNK> dumb dialog br br some viewers will note that <UNK> character's name is drawn from audrey <UNK> role in breakfast at <UNK> and that <UNK> character's name is a play on the name of famed author patricia <UNK> he is actually trying to re write breakfast as a horror film believe it or not br br i suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film i mean writer director <UNK> <UNK> seems to genuinely care for his characters and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare br br after a silly villain explains everything to the audience confrontation the film goes on to submit a hideous out there climax that has to be seen to be believed this film certainly does not <UNK> on the gore br br but hey drew kills her mother in this one no i'm not joking <UNK> barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered br br drew is always very watchable and very sexy in this one <UNK> comes off as a likable enough nice sort of guy but the <UNK> of the film has to be the scene with sally <UNK> an attractive veteran who's very professional in her one scene as a former nun who's started a phone sex business br br the film is basically junk but fairly amusing on a sleazy <UNK> little level br br 4 10
<START> the second renaissance part 1 let's us show how the machines first <UNK> against the humans it all starts of with a single case in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want br br although an interesting premise the story gets really silly from then on with violent <UNK> between the robots and mankind somehow it doesn't seem right as another reviewer points it it's all a little too clever br br the <UNK> stories that stay close to the core of the matrix in particular <UNK> work for the best as for second renaissance part 1 i'd say it's too violent and too silly 4 10
<START> norman is that you was this is all third hand so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an african american family from a jewish one when it made the transition off stage and onto screen also it was one of those movies originally filmed in video so the <UNK> from the theater can't have been that great still performances by <UNK> foxx and others were pretty good br br what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family for that reason alone it's pretty interesting if not a little hollywood don't believe me check out lines about <UNK> etc very stereotypical not too deep br br but the movie really shines in a couple of areas there is a side splitting scene when <UNK> foxx is trying to find his wife who's run away with his brother to <UNK> in a <UNK> up <UNK> the phone conversation across the border is really memorable br br but the best scene in the movie is when <UNK> flowers and <UNK> did his their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and <UNK> to the best of my knowledge this is the only time that routine was filmed and it's a slightly <UNK> up and much shorter version i'm told still it's vintage <UNK> and shouldn't be missed people are still stealing lines from <UNK> the man was truly gifted enjoy the movie
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life the plot and message are horrible there are too many mistakes in this movie that it's impossible to keep up i don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination let alone 2 here's why 1 sam lee portrays a angry irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad pros he's angry alright cons when it comes to the explanation scene he cannot convey the sadness disappointment he has in his father the crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally <UNK> out tears from the corner of his eyes br br 2 to connect the movie to the title there were <UNK> or dog <UNK> sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer i understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or what not but it's just <UNK> dumb 3 why the heck did the cops not shoot the killer what the heck is wrong with this movie when the killer started stabbing an officer shoot him he's already dead what the heck there were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed but i do not know why he wasn't 4 during the scene where the girl had her foot hurt in the scene it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was hurt so how the heck in the next scene that she's <UNK> all her weight on her left foot and this is the actress nominated as the best new performer wtf 5 the sounds in the movie are off sync br br 6 i am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in south east asia so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight 7 this movie is just too violent without a purpose cops are beating <UNK> to a pulp and then if they <UNK> they give them marijuana and coke this is overall the worst movie i truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a <UNK> and sick person i have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life worst movie ever
<START> this movie is really nerve <UNK> <UNK> movie stallone was good as always michael <UNK> put on a surprising performance and john <UNK> play a excellent villain the music is fantastic especially the theme the movie is action packed and never dull if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger you won't be disappointed
<START> i'm not a stage <UNK> a movie could have been made of this play and it would almost necessarily require changes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but the modest <UNK> of this material are lost or misunderstood by the movie's creators who are in full on shallow blockbuster mode it would be hard to imagine a worse director perhaps only josh logan jack warner could have ruined this in the same way attenborough did br br <UNK> a chorus line was a triumph of <UNK> as a production method dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stage career experiences very 70s then bennett and <UNK> took some time handed them a song and cast them as themselves astonishing unbelievably modern the <UNK> <UNK> is in turn about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of because the play doesn't matter it was <UNK> before the idea was invented 25 years before adaptation <UNK> with a similar idea <UNK> was also another in a <UNK> trend that is still alive which is a hallmark of modern creativity that technique itself is compelling that there's more drama in an average person's life than you could ever <UNK> with invented characters what a <UNK> idea the stage play had one performance area an empty stage and three different ways to alter the backdrop to <UNK> visual tedium not to keep viewers distracted the space <UNK> and the actors stories are <UNK> it worked just fine that was the point all these ideas are <UNK> or <UNK> set wise there wasn't one and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final <UNK> in which the <UNK> one is finally <UNK> performed in full gold top hats and <UNK> with moves we recognize because we've watched them in practice sessions the <UNK> up anxiety of the play is released and audiences went nuts br br after <UNK> <UNK> this it's like a <UNK> <UNK> bird he clearly has the earlier respected all that jazz and <UNK> stage piece <UNK> in mind as he makes his choices <UNK> score was edgy interesting for it's time but time has not been kind to it it's as <UNK> as jazz hands and that's before attenborough ever touches it he's remarkable at finding whatever good was left and <UNK> it br br a simple question might have helped attenborough while filming this could i bear spending even a few minutes with people like these a major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater pivotal by it's absence in theater would be addressed in the film format there's never been a more frontal play the answer they came up with was i'm sorry what was the question the cast has been <UNK> from a <UNK> number of unique <UNK> to a crowd <UNK> each other and the audience and <UNK> their grating <UNK> together i was well past my annoyance <UNK> when that annoying little <UNK> <UNK> across the stage on a rope <UNK> at the absent audience the play made you understand theater people this movie just makes you want to choke them br br perhaps <UNK> annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience les <UNK> miss <UNK> instead of relating to other characters started here but the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie br br a chorus line is pure schlock
<START> i love watching early colour films you mean those 40s clothes weren't all grey br br margaret <UNK> <UNK> this movie her eccentric <UNK> is actually rather attractive and yes she has an amazing <UNK> figure but i feel she was given her head rather too much she probably developed this characterisation over many performances and nobody told her if it gets a laugh leave it out she does too much deranged <UNK> about when she's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth the <UNK> <UNK> joke is that <UNK> were usually portrayed as <UNK> females in long <UNK> <UNK> behaves like a retired <UNK> we'll really put our backs into it the contrast between her <UNK> <UNK> manner and her wacky beliefs isn't really brought out br br just because all the actors are english apart from <UNK> the americans feel they have to use the words brit stiff lip and upper oh give it a rest the three main characters lose their <UNK> constantly and make <UNK> remarks did he make love to you yes but very <UNK> he was in the <UNK>
<START> a somewhat <UNK> <UNK> portrait of abraham <UNK> early years from director john ford <UNK> primarily on a trial in which the young lawyer <UNK> two brothers accused of murder br br the film offers an interesting portrayal of this important american figure and the film is well made but seems somewhat <UNK> without any of the great moments from his <UNK> or even his <UNK> with stephen douglas the obvious intent was to portray lincoln as young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become but the result for me was that while i admired the portrayal it just wasn't as satisfying as i think it could have been with a greater scope br br in the role of abraham lincoln we have henry fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength <UNK> performance includes some <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> which are fairly effective in presenting a portrayal of lincoln particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the <UNK> which occasionally is a bit to overt br br the supporting cast is solid and surprisingly does not include that many of ford's regular supporting cast sometimes referred to as his stock company but we do have ward bond one of the most prolific character actors in hollywood bond has appeared in more of the <UNK> top 100 films than any other actor both the original and <UNK> list he has also appeared in 11 best picture <UNK> br br the film features one scene that would seem to have inspired a quite similar scene in to kill a <UNK> where it would be done even better than it is here even though that scene is one of the most effective in this film
<START> picking up right after the <UNK> showdown of supremacy this is <UNK> greatest adventure and his final climax throughout the tight <UNK> min runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to <UNK> paris <UNK> and ultimately new york damon is every inch of the hard trained killer robert <UNK> imagined he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now and it's the <UNK> emotions to his character that makes him so believable and it's exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar <UNK> of himself that's so breathtaking in this third bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it ultimatum delivers such an high <UNK> performance that you'll find yourself <UNK> and <UNK> over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull offs just look out for two great car chases and a fight scene as realistic as bond vs shaw back in <UNK> director <UNK> has <UNK> himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get a true pay off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy thriller standard
<START> this is a true story of an australian couple <UNK> are charged with murder when their <UNK> child disappears meryl streep is excellent as always and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn't particularly likable br br the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam <UNK> murder case in <UNK> during the 50's these real life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge <UNK> stating why isn't sam <UNK> in jail the <UNK> eventually <UNK> to this relentless pressure and <UNK> was tried and convicted only after years in jail was he <UNK> br br i love movies which tell a true story do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process this is one of those movies other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include <UNK> the thin blue line and <UNK> <UNK> in particular the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended br br 8 10
<START> there are no reasons to watch this movie should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life's every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill like that would ever happen then get this movie from the video shop if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie be prepared however for you mind to be <UNK> by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk go figure but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie <UNK> <UNK> showing her chest sadly no other reason than that
<START> i watched the un aired episodes online and i was so sad that the show won't be back it had the best cast of mature talented actors and an amazing chemistry it seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life towards the end the show became engaging sexy and highly watchable of course some of the story lines are not realistic so what the characters are all likable and you root for them the show reminded me a cross between 2 other favorites sex and the city and <UNK> big kudos to all the cast note to abc <UNK> <UNK> ratings reports do not show you true results the show audience will mostly record it i've been very disappointed with major networks for <UNK> us with reality tv or teenage oriented shows why to get a mature thoughtful well acted material we have to switch to hbo or fx i can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online the new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers
<START> <UNK> was a show i grew up with from late night <UNK> with penn and <UNK> to the one the only joe bob <UNK> the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years and provided some of the best drive in memories to ever come outside of the drive in br br without a doubt the best late night television ever if you didn't stay up you were missing out br br i know john bloom and joe bob live on but i want them back where they belong <UNK> question did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of the <UNK> q br br long live <UNK>
<START> well not yet at least br br it's not listed in the worst 100 br br so let's all team up and put it in it's <UNK> place br br this is truly a bad movie and i liked <UNK>
<START> nicole kidman is a wonderful actress and here she's great i really liked ben chaplin in the thin red line and he is very good here too this is not great cinema but i was most entertained given most films these days this is high praise indeed
<START> several posters have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his desire to make a film showing ingrid bergman smiling to camera the short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a <UNK> few got to do so at this stage of her career bergman couldn't get arrested in 1949 she left hollywood to make a picture in europe fell for director <UNK> <UNK> and never looked forward after five <UNK> in italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year after making this for <UNK> she was back where she <UNK> and with an oscar to boot for <UNK> this is one of three movies that <UNK> made in color around this time and on balance it's better than the golden coach which isn't hard and about even with french can can <UNK> probably figured that with so much going for her bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and <UNK> picked two <UNK> in jean <UNK> and mel <UNK> solid <UNK> in both cases the plot is actually based on a real incident in french history but <UNK> is content to give it a once over lightly and concentrate on <UNK> the paintings of his father in set up after set up in its <UNK> colors it resembles another film of the period les <UNK> <UNK> which is no bad thing all in all it remains a pleasant <UNK> <UNK> a beautiful and charismatic actress
<START> after hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat <UNK> continued to go about introducing viewers to 'the twilight <UNK> in a very strange way by <UNK> one the series biggest <UNK> as the fourth episode 'the sixteen <UNK> <UNK> is one of the more understated episodes focusing on an aging movie <UNK> inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes because of this approach the episode is under <UNK> at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story br br both the leads <UNK> <UNK> as barbara jean <UNK> and martin <UNK> as her frustrated but caring agent shine in their performances the main problem with the episode is that the supposedly 25 year old footage of the actress is unconvincing <UNK> looks identical when playing the young <UNK> as she does when playing the middle aged <UNK> and this <UNK> the tragedy of the situation significantly fortunately <UNK> acts her <UNK> off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past it's a situation most can <UNK> with and yet <UNK> is far from a sympathetic character she is a <UNK> donna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her such as the <UNK> <UNK> co star who she <UNK> <UNK> because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were it is somewhat surprising then that she is rewarded with a happy ending it is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly pre <UNK> in the opening moments when <UNK> scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen what is not clear at the beginning however is whether being sucked into the <UNK> will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in <UNK> what we have and living in the moment as it turns out <UNK> is allowed to return to the past she <UNK> for a testament to how strong the <UNK> thinking of humans can be br br 'the sixteen <UNK> <UNK> gets better with each viewing the top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past even though we can never return except in the twilight zone
<START> this series is set a year after the mission to <UNK> in the movie stargate it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention such as how was the stargate <UNK> without a human computer where did the <UNK> <UNK> race come from how many are there br br the first episode has a retired jack o'neill spelled with 2 <UNK> <UNK> to active duty by general george <UNK> due to an attack by the shut down stargate from <UNK> a powerful <UNK> who killed four men and kidnapped one woman we meet samantha carter a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time and is determined to go through now we find out that daniel got married on <UNK> and that there are hundreds of gate <UNK> that they can <UNK> then <UNK> wife gets captured by <UNK> and becomes his new queen br br it continues in the second episode where general <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> which includes nine teams in which jack's team will be sg 1 which consists of jack samantha and daniel they go to <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> to rescue <UNK> wife and another one captured at <UNK> named <UNK> they get captured and just as <UNK> gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners a <UNK> named <UNK> first prime of <UNK> saves them and goes to earth with them where he is made part of sg 1 br br that was only the beginning of the adventure in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future gotten transported to alternate realities <UNK> bodies grown old met alien races which include a rebel alliance of <UNK> called the <UNK> in which <UNK> dad becomes a member the <UNK> a cute little race in which we see <UNK> most often he's jack's buddy and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times br br the show was recently canceled but lasted ten seasons in season nine a new enemy called the <UNK> came in <UNK> brand new powers new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators the <UNK> season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters ben <UNK> as cameron mitchell the new leader of sg 1 and <UNK> black as <UNK> <UNK> a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team br br very well produced interesting characters fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack this one has it all a different way of travelling the galaxy and different kinds of adventures this is one show you don't want to miss <UNK> the gate and step through you won't regret it
<START> i <UNK> each and every frame of this beautiful movie it is about regular people people we all know who suffer a little in their life and have some <UNK> to carry around just like all of us robert deniro ed harris and kathy baker breathe life into their portrayals and are all excellent but harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real you would swear he really is a <UNK> who drinks so he won't have to feel anything baker as his put upon sister also has some delicate moments when deniro gives her flowers in one scene it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably wasn't very worthwhile
<START> the thing about calling house of the dead the worst movie of all time is that it's really not there are worse movies out there i watch alot of hong kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called a movie br br house of the dead is however one of the worst films i've ever seen at the theatres walking out half way through i actually felt i was somewhat dumber for having set through 45 minutes of this piece of garbage
<START> this is a great film br br i first saw this film when it came out i just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it a lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life the film is actually a great 80's example of the type of films made then keaton is at his best all the actors actually did a very good job and ron howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it the pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80's is too funny being from the 80's i loved seeing the ugly <UNK> again the film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80's film lovers
<START> i was lucky enough to have seen this on a <UNK> during a film festival and was <UNK> so hard with what i saw i returned the next night for its second of three <UNK> a funny savage and sharp <UNK> attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment <UNK> <UNK> without <UNK> by the lowest common <UNK> target audience <UNK> by a lone <UNK> journalist who slowly takes in members for his <UNK> war on predictability is what the movie's all about and is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you're left after the credits roll with hope <UNK> and excited that original films can still be made anyone frustrated with <UNK> expectations for something to light up their <UNK> would do well to hunt and i do mean hunt this <UNK> seen item down for fans of fight club and any charlie kaufman film and required viewing for anyone who avoids <UNK> like a <UNK> dog
<START> some spoilers br br this movie is sometimes subtitled life <UNK> that's often taken as reference to the final scene but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once <UNK> series is after this sloppy and illogical send off br br there's a hey kids let's put on a show air about this <UNK> which can be endearing in spots some fans will feel like <UNK> as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances co writer co producer tom <UNK> and his pals pack the goings on with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real <UNK> <UNK> br br that's on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the <UNK> show varied casts your old favorites as well as later non favorites br br there was always a <UNK> of war <UNK> quality conscious executive producer barry <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> and the rest of the creative team against budget conscious nbc <UNK> who simply wanted a another moronic police <UNK> like <UNK> bridges which regularly beat homicide in the ratings the pressure told as the show <UNK> between riveting realism that <UNK> its form and sleazy <UNK> that <UNK> it br br unfortunately for this movie <UNK> co writers <UNK> and eric <UNK> and director jean de <UNK> simply threw in the <UNK> they took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically <UNK> new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members br br briefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show the former heart of <UNK> homicide unit <UNK> <UNK> as lt al <UNK> is now a kurt <UNK> like candidate for mayor and <UNK> himself makes a cameo appearance but this promising start immediately and <UNK> takes a tragic turn br br the spotlight shifts to <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> son mike a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere <UNK> was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly <UNK> the tv series but the question for viewers always was is mike that uncomfortable as <UNK> son or is <UNK> that uncomfortable in the role br br to be fair <UNK> doesn't get a chance to play out the main story without <UNK> that's because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that <UNK> on the intelligence of the show's loyal voters br br an apparent snuff <UNK> video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the internet after some red herrings the detectives arrested a <UNK> suspect but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered later br br let's <UNK> he forgot to file the <UNK> because it wasn't the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the <UNK> the entire <UNK> <UNK> the u s attorney general nbc court tv the bbc <UNK> <UNK> people the sun the washington post the new york times the la times time magazine the times of london the <UNK> the <UNK> mail and guardian <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> paris match <UNK> and computer world weren't calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case br br nevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates <UNK> back to <UNK> to help out there's quite an array of talent on display unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on display br br two of the strongest actors clark johnson and melissa leo are criminally underused while time wasted on jon <UNK> and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials the writers do seem to <UNK> this presenting jason <UNK> as the latest big deal detective on the other hand they give easy come easy go michelle forbes a very affecting scene br br there's some other sly casting with actual lt gary <UNK> the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective guests drop in from other shows like <UNK> allen doing her deadpan and clueless miss sally from the children's show beloved by the inmates on <UNK> oz <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> tv turns up as herself br br even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting ed <UNK> jr actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing dr victor <UNK> from <UNK> st elsewhere he's still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting then you remember didn't st <UNK> turn out to be an <UNK> boy's fantasy br br the most useful cameo reflects corporate <UNK> this movie was made when court tv bought re run rights to the series that network contributed legal <UNK> helen <UNK> who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on oz the tv <UNK> does an efficient job <UNK> the news that is plot points for <UNK> br br although she's so thin that she disappears when she turns <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> handles a bit of physical comedy with <UNK> he shows more juice in his scenes with <UNK> than with any of his usual colleagues perhaps those two should have done a spin off br br as the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top although they are <UNK> with a loser script andre <UNK> and kyle <UNK> overcome it their performances remind viewers what made homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever br br it's fun to watch top pros do their stuff it's just a shame this movie doesn't give them more of a chance die hard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it
<START> i couldn't agree more with <UNK> <UNK> and i a <UNK> comments a perfect laid back sunday morning movie the humor is subtle exact opposite of slapstick as one misguided <UNK> noted br br but what always <UNK> to <UNK> me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previews hbo maybe had never heard of it previously don't know why it wasn't <UNK> that well when dvd's were released en mass it was one of the first movies i replaced a great combination of cast and writing plus the back drop of montana wilderness doesn't hurt things either beautiful br br it's probably not the type of comedy for everyone but what is if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley this probably won't be your cup of tea this movie needs your full attention the humor is mostly in the dialog br br i believe my next viewing will probably be about my <UNK> but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the <UNK> of the police cars start blowing off i'm going to loose it ed <UNK> face is priceless recommended <UNK>
<START> a hot headed cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers up the crime but must deal with a guilty conscience while he tries to solve a murder case andrews and tierney are reunited with director preminger in a film noir that is as effective as laura their earlier collaboration andrews is perfectly cast as the earnest cop a good guy caught up in unfortunate circumstances the acting is fine all around including malden as a tough police captain and <UNK> as <UNK> protective father the screenplay by <UNK> a great and prolific screenwriter is taut and suspenseful and preminger creates a great atmosphere
<START> eddie murphy for best supporting actor what an insult to alan arkin and <UNK> <UNK> br br jamie foxx who can act walks through this film like a zombie br br <UNK> that was acting br br this movie <UNK> in comparison to chicago or just about any other recent musical br br if it were not for the great singing and performance of jennifer hudson i would have given this a zero br br and no i never saw the stage play so i am not making the typical broadway vs hollywood rap
<START> i was young film student in 1979 when the union of the soviet filmmakers came to <UNK> <UNK> and premiered <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stalker and <UNK> <UNK> marathon i was stunned by the <UNK> dimension of the art form then and only then i saw <UNK> 4 and 1 2 hours epic and was speechless way better then <UNK> <UNK> by far br br hope <UNK> will somehow get to the negative and make director's restored version full <UNK> someday on dvd of course also i <UNK> fought in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were <UNK> soviet film with bad taste time is on my side
<START> the movie looked like a walk through for <UNK> study most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to <UNK> male <UNK> and thus all that fuss about now who drew this penis sounded a bit gratuitous dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful albeit visually this movie got its moments i almost dig it when <UNK> got into painting a mental picture but then movie <UNK> back onto <UNK> highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while
<START> feeding the masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie <UNK> that is going around mostly due to the popularity of movies such as land of the dead and the resident evil series br br it starts at a television station which is <UNK> by the military and are <UNK> that the <UNK> virus zombies are close to <UNK> and the city will soon be free to do their business again the problem is this is totally false zombies are running <UNK> and only a small minority of people are aware among them are torch william <UNK> the camera man <UNK> <UNK> morris the lead anchor woman who for some reason is listed as playing <UNK> on this website and roger patrick cohen their military <UNK> torch and <UNK> are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service or some other government agency and they are heavily <UNK> br br this movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box cover saying we hold feeding the masses on a higher level than any o the three <UNK> the <UNK> films by george a <UNK> the source of that quote has lost all credibility with me br br let me just say that this movie is bad i don't mean bad like i was expecting more i obviously was though but i mean bad in that i could not find any redeeming qualities in the film whatsoever the acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards i can't even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor actress there really was not one if i had to give a nod to someone i would say roger the military <UNK> was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying much br br i would have to recommend to pass on this movie despite the box cover looking pretty good it's what originally drew me to the movie 3 10
<START> all you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten then they start rolling the title credits you see slugs in big letters followed shortly thereafter by the movie <UNK> i was worried i had accidentally tuned into slugs the musical or slugs the game show anyway from there the movie <UNK> into a kill fest you see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his <UNK> <UNK> two people get attacked by slugs while having sex and a girl falling on her back in an underground <UNK> get <UNK> to death by killer slugs it's a pretty silly movie falling in the so bad it's good category it also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 my guess was 1974 i'm very surprised it has received as high a score as it has here because most people here don't give those types of movie any love but if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable this is one of your prime candidates
<START> i've always liked johnny <UNK> and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one br br when we first meet frank in the film's title role he's the brother of a notorious <UNK> who's out of town at the moment the brother strikes terror in the <UNK> of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the <UNK> safe and secure in his shadow only <UNK> kirk has any feeling for him she's the daughter of <UNK> wallace ford and dorothy adams br br two other <UNK> arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra's brother and he's coming to his town to take over they <UNK> sinatra and run him out of town kirk follows him br br overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of <UNK> it's a well acted performance almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm pity for some reason this has not been seen for years br br two other performances of note are <UNK> <UNK> as former <UNK> turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen he's a villain of incredible <UNK> pure evil <UNK> walking and talking on the silver screen br br however what i like about johnny <UNK> is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with let's just say i believe johnny <UNK> was <UNK> answer to high <UNK> and a <UNK> for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order
<START> i think that the movie was kind of weird in the opening scene a person is killed for no reason he doesn't get mentioned again the special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie it isn't the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie i give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale
<START> the education of little tree is just not as good as it could have been little <UNK> education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you whatever happened to the three <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> when the idiot back talks the teacher at the <UNK> school place he starts crying and talking to the sky oh my gosh sure the lady was a little harsh but then james <UNK> character comes and takes him away leaving the audience thinking that little tree was absolutely right he should learn to adapt to new discipline those were the times talking to a star is not going to change a thing little tree needs to learn that his <UNK> <UNK> are not always right
<START> i can't believe john died while filming an episode he <UNK> on set read this out of his biography online john ritter was born in <UNK> <UNK> on september <UNK> 1948 br br he landed his last television role in 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter 2002 based on the popular book on this sitcom he played paul <UNK> a loving yet rational dad who laid down the ground rules for his three children the show was a ratings winner in its first season and won a peoples choice award for best new comedy and also won for favorite comedy series by the family awards while working 8 simple rules he also starred in his second to last film <UNK> 2003 br br that same year while john was <UNK> for the 4th 3rd series episode of 8 simple rules now <UNK> he fell ill henry <UNK> described it as john looked like he had food <UNK> then he <UNK> on the set he was quickly rushed to a nearby hospital the same <UNK> hospital where he was born he was <UNK> with an <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> heart flaw he <UNK> surgery but did not make it john ritter died at age <UNK> just 1 week away from his <UNK> birthday leaving his wife amy <UNK> and 4 children
<START> the <UNK> in this movie were well <UNK> there is no doubt about it al gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got al gore is certainly quite an actor he sounds so concerned but actions speak <UNK> than words throughout this movie there are political <UNK> and references to his political career <UNK> throughout the movie br br jimmy carter unlike al gore is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well when carter thought we needed to <UNK> energy he turned down the <UNK> in the white house and got warm by wearing a <UNK> br br al gore tells us that we have to <UNK> energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet how much energy does his jet use and how much more <UNK> does his jet create how much energy does it take to heat <UNK> swimming pool behind his mansion it would be nice if we could <UNK> electricity by using smaller <UNK> and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used but if we did the power company would react to a 50 <UNK> of energy by calling it a 50 loss in <UNK> and <UNK> their <UNK> by raising the rates by 50 so just turning it off would not be a very good idea br br this movie is a <UNK> appeal to allow big <UNK> to take control of everything in the name of saving planet earth that is
<START> if you want your vision of chaplin limited to a lovable tramp and you get your belly laughs from pathos watch something else if however you love slapstick comedy as performed by one of the best do watch this one br br the image is of the tramp who really cannot get the girl he spots another couple kissing on a park <UNK> and he has a blast ruining their fun br br this is one of <UNK> park comedies filmed in mack <UNK> park with <UNK> and cops and couples these shorts work as the format allows chaplin to shine as he weaves through <UNK> br br i checked the box as this could be considered a spoiler though it's not if you've seen these films everyone ends up in the pond except chaplin he gets the girl who in this case was played by <UNK> <UNK> a k a mrs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>

<START> after <UNK> the man responsible for the murder of his boss deputy sheriff thomas <UNK> <UNK> iii is assigned the task of taking the killer back to italy on the way however the plane is <UNK> to <UNK> not long after landing the killer escapes now and with little help from the <UNK> police deputy sheriff <UNK> is out to <UNK> a murderer but will his shoot first take names later brand of texas justice work in a foreign country br br let me get this out right up front i've seen final justice both with and without the mystery science theater 3000 commentary i've seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole and i've seen the cut up tv version that was used for mst3k having said that i've got to admit that i much prefer the mst3k version why because final justice is one lousy movie the mst3k commentary helps make it much more <UNK> on its own it's a real <UNK> of an action movie with corny dialogue often delivered with such thick italian accents that it's impossible to understand bad acting weak direction gigantic plot holes and most everything else you'll find in a bad movie and if most of final justice wasn't so bad it's good it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else so yes i enjoy the often very funny mst3k commentary over the bad movie on its own br br my main sticking points with the mst3k commentary and with most of the reviews i've read on final justice however involve the criticisms of joe don baker the main weaknesses in <UNK> performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes <UNK> in his direction instead i think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place joe don baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor but he's not the kind of guy i would call an action hero by any stretch of the imagination he's more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of james bond movies or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with final justice point your finger at director <UNK> clark <UNK> resume can't begin to compare with <UNK> so i say lay off joe don baker
<START> peter <UNK> version s are better films overall from objective point of view that being said they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings and let me explain why br br firstly the acting of the on screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jackson's lotr the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really silly save for <UNK> later about them and they certainly pack more personality than jackson's party even with much more limited dialogue time and that is because of superior voice acting of the bakshi's lotr take <UNK> for example in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority <UNK> the lord and with a seasoned <UNK> <UNK> the ranger this is due to john <UNK> brilliant voice acting compare that to viggo <UNK> rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven hurt beats <UNK> hands down br br and then there is <UNK> probably the most <UNK> and the most popular character in the whole saga in this bakshi version <UNK> william <UNK> is a real wizard and by that i don't mean he shoots <UNK> from his <UNK> he does not but his presence is just captivating he is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease add to that his looks tall old as the ancient <UNK> beard long as his body sharp eyes <UNK> hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat a perfect <UNK> just like in the books ian <UNK> <UNK> in the other hand is simply just too boring he looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or <UNK> no sword yes a sword in this bakshi version <UNK> scores couple of bloody <UNK> kills with his sword as he did in the books and those are stylish slow motion kills <UNK> is not a power to be messed with and it must be noted that while i'm sad to say this the great christopher lee didn't bring <UNK> alive <UNK> kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and lines br br before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general <UNK> of the <UNK> are also superior to jackson's <UNK> bad guys bakshi's <UNK> <UNK> their enemies or each other constantly with <UNK> screams and nasty language they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion and finally the black riders or the <UNK> those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one not just some riders wearing black and they speak with haunting voice which <UNK> their victim my favorite scene in the film is when the <UNK> are chasing <UNK> near the river while peter jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and <UNK> sky br br but as much i like this film more than jackson's the latter are if only technically still better and that is because of some key visuals as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters all <UNK> and the main cast and real actors covered with paint i don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just don't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures this is especially true with humans riders of <UNK> <UNK> people etc <UNK> are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters <UNK> while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to <UNK> version they have <UNK> green skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth br br biggest screw up in this films visuals <UNK> are the <UNK> while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson the latter has clearly superior <UNK> in fact they are perfect with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn <UNK> disney <UNK> and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned again the voice acting is ok with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the <UNK> damage made by these little <UNK> well i never really liked those <UNK> anyway br br general failures in the bakshi script are well known limited playing time with limited budget and a lot of missing scenes so while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesn't do it in extensive detail compared to jackson's version br br in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior br br overall atmosphere it feels more like middle earth overall voice acting music i really dig the fantasy score by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one of the john <UNK> finest roles king <UNK> <UNK> black riders <UNK> he's not some fairy hippie in this one br br while jackson version is better br br because it covers the whole story overall visuals and special effects <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br lord of the rings by ralph bakshi even with it's well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of <UNK> fantasy world very well if not perfectly i'll give it a score of <UNK> out of 10
<START> this is a film that was very well done i had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release cheers to the director and all the actors the supporting cast gave eva <UNK> what she needed to take this to the top as everyone else here states the latter portion of the film is riveting katie cassidy did an amazing job with her character being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made she has quite the career ahead of her i was amazed at her performance i completely enjoyed the film <UNK> my values in life and <UNK> and am a better person for it a great message lies within the film release it so all can enjoy
<START> like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob br br then to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained <UNK> and said someone should beat those two kids up the picture on the cover the chase as it were total <UNK> which i guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sense br br i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film it's like michael moore's roger me but if roger me was moore mocking the people of <UNK> it's completely <UNK> and totally inane wow can you believe that people who suffered under the <UNK> of communism would be really excited to have <UNK> full of food what <UNK> and it's not so much look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable <UNK> to the <UNK> it was that as many people in the film say the <UNK> were <UNK> low someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were <UNK> for duck that's not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low <UNK> bravo <UNK> way to stick it to the people on the bottom br br way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people you should be very proud how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say haha no such house exists your so stupid and loved to be <UNK> to by the media br br morgan please like me <UNK> unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since <UNK> as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him br br avoid like the plague
<START> boris and bela do well together in this film whether they are against each other or <UNK> the same boat i saw this one in 1972 and just purchased it from borders this year this time watching it with my children i took note of 2 things it held the attention of a 3 4 and 5 year old and i caught a few things i hadn't when i first watched it very swift story with an unpredictable end a must for movie buffs
<START> this film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him however somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn't know where to go from there br br one unbelievable event followed the next russia must be very small because they are all <UNK> into each other all the time the motivation of the female lead character <UNK> why does she still follow him after they got off the ship why doesn't she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody the side stories were completely ridiculous was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny and what was the story with the younger sister about still with all this seeming <UNK> of the plot the movie managed to be completely predictable br br the saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential as i said the idea of the film was good the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good too so this could have been a really good film but it wasn't
<START> this one has a lot going for it sinatra <UNK> <UNK> pamela <UNK> and a lesser amount of <UNK> iturbi grayson plus a little ho hum kelly it was sinatra's first real movie where the <UNK> spent a buck and you could see it on screen previously he'd appeared in two low <UNK> higher and higher and step lively but if they'd only relied on the sinatra <UNK> and deep <UNK> <UNK> plus <UNK> ego <UNK> piano spots we'd have been left with a much <UNK> movie and a better showcase for sinatra as it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two <UNK> with kelly we hate to leave i <UNK> her to his own <UNK> what makes the sunset the charm of you and i fall in love too easily despite this step lively remains the best sinatra musical of the forties on one <UNK> the budget
<START> unhinged is one strange little film a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre it's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique it's plot is fairly overdone three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her <UNK> daughter very quickly the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic on top of that the mother and daughter seem to have a very very strange relationship as they <UNK> intensely in front of their <UNK> at dinner the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and <UNK> her of <UNK> guys in at night to sleep with them halfway through the film when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help the killing begins br br as far as the acting goes this film is at the bottom of the barrel none of the three stranded girls can act particularly the lead girl it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same wooden tone throughout the film the mother and daughter are better but not much the film is also quite dull in parts and really really drags the killings are gruesome but nothing we haven't seen before however as mentioned on here the film really <UNK> points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic <UNK> camp unfortunately the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring boring pacing the isolated creepy looking mansion and the dark foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism but that is quickly <UNK> when one of the characters attempts to act it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end but i say you are better off just fast <UNK> to the last 10 minutes 4 out 10
<START> first off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that i hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you <UNK> if they're all the result of <UNK> br br now i will say this i did see the first three american pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that i'd ever seen they were all right and outright masterpieces compared to the three american pie presents films i still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie br br i also have a few other questions too br br who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio <UNK> and production resources br br who <UNK> the final script and what was that person smoking when they <UNK> it br br and lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the <UNK> bin at blockbuster or wal mart br br there is so much wrong with this movie that i can't write a really <UNK> review of it because it would <UNK> the maximum allowed words on this forum so i'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it br br the plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for <UNK> minutes but the biggest thing that i can see wrong with this movie is the acting br br while most of the cast are talentless no <UNK> who will probably be forgotten in a few years br br the one and only big name in this movie is eugene levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing <UNK> on his face that says to the viewer i know this isn't funny and i'm wasting my talents but hey i'm getting <UNK> for it so who cares he doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny he really deserves better than this garbage br br as i mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great tv shows <UNK> savage from the classic canadian series wind at my back plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating there are things that he could teach to <UNK> skin <UNK> that you almost wish he'd die a slow and painful death on screen christopher <UNK> <UNK> law order just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film br br maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the mpaa and get an r rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sexual content that it should have gotten the x rating the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating br br it's interesting that twenty five years ago when wes craven <UNK> a nightmare on elm street to the mpaa for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage i believe that it was part of a death scene that had a <UNK> casting of a breast in it to avoid getting an x rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released br br but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the r rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would <UNK> the <UNK> x rating br br the last thing that really <UNK> me is the writing this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely <UNK> sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass nearly every <UNK> situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so <UNK> that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of <UNK> sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class br br the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any <UNK> more crass and offensive this pie is filled with road <UNK>
<START> if you fast forward through the horrible singing you will find a classic fairy tale underneath christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role his trademark style of acting works well for the sly <UNK> in boots the other actors are well for their parts i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward the king in particular appears a real <UNK> though and i wonder if he is supposed to be i can not remember the original tale the special effects are typical of the eighties but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today overall i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart
<START> this film appears to draw a borderline on one side those who love it on the other those who find it unbearable br br to begin with there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not getting of course jet <UNK> mask looks like bruce lee's <UNK> he's supposed to it's a joke the guy who has a time bomb <UNK> to his heart outrageous of course it's a joke some readers will probably ask if this film is supposed to be so funny why all the excessive and gory violence well for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different from culture to culture and while hong kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme it's certainly only slightly more than average for a hk action film br br also black mask is really the kind of film that takes a <UNK> conventions and pushes them to extremes simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic after decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds many people were horrified to see bonnie and clyde and the <UNK> of the wild bunch <UNK> blood all over the place but the fact is when you're shot with rapid metal <UNK> it's almost certain that blood will <UNK> especially from an <UNK> br br this film is a chinese comic book movie it is true that the <UNK> films never get this gory but if they were faithful to reality they would be well despite its comic book origins this film is faithful to reality br br the only complaint i have is the flashy over stylized filming and editing if the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to hollywood style nostalgia as e g the <UNK> or the recent sky captain film i doubt anyone would have found it offensive br br but as it stands i still had a <UNK> fun watching this movie
<START> it would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie <UNK> as the house next door to be adapted for film or television the book was <UNK> in 1978 one reason could be problems <UNK> 'the <UNK> the house in this lifetime film is really so ugly that i can't imagine anyone buying it in fact it's so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built br br i'm not crazy about horror genre books but this one was hard to put down when i came across it around ten years ago the main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life and this is one of the <UNK> strengths they are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon or the devil <UNK> without witnessing and <UNK> the events described so well in the book however it is a downbeat book for the most part and i don't think that appeals to the people who run lifetime maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come a better house better music a better screenplay and darker lighting would certainly help
<START> a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live <UNK> are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her <UNK> a literal <UNK> of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid <UNK> as well as new songs from the bette of <UNK> album <UNK> generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine <UNK> proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around
<START> hello there br br this is my first post in imdb even though i use it as a reference for quite a while i would therefore like to <UNK> you all the fact that i am a greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement i hope not to your annoyance br br i spent 2 years of my life all we <UNK> did actually <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and not <UNK> as you see everywhere rhyme by rhyme if i recall well it was <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> grade and <UNK> odyssey on <UNK> grade <UNK> <UNK> was a big disappointment to me and my fellow <UNK> around the campus i study in the uk br br <UNK> <UNK> is one of the very best literature works ever made it was composed by a greek poet <UNK> a whole 400 years after the actual war historians put <UNK> war around <UNK> <UNK> and the actual reason of the war not being <UNK> beauty but the <UNK> crucial position of <UNK> that said one may now understand that <UNK> <UNK> is not presenting the actual events as it's not accurate historically but this was never the purpose of this work br br reading this huge poem one can find himself wondering for the very <UNK> of honour love anger hate <UNK> discipline loyalty and so on the best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle none of these though were revealed in <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> was really cheap to my eyes and to other intellectual people english <UNK> and german colleagues of me as well it is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario by the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster computers graphics did the whole work and yet it is <UNK> <UNK> best work br br i conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead i would give <UNK> 2 out of 10 it is a really expensive b movie br br cheers br br alex
<START> paul lukas played a russian intellectual making his living as a <UNK> in br br grand slam directed by william <UNK> 1933 it is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celebrity the <UNK> and the russian <UNK> hat check girl played by loretta young become america's <UNK> as bridge partners who do no <UNK> with the aid of <UNK> and ghost writer <UNK> <UNK> the wonderfully deadpan frank <UNK> they become walking <UNK> br br for the <UNK> system a system of <UNK> whatever one feels like br br since <UNK> are not rational there is no basis for <UNK> about their stupidity br br a duel with <UNK> bridge guru cedric van <UNK> sounds close to <UNK> no and i suspect the choice of the character's name <UNK> was also a slam at another kind of system a <UNK> up <UNK> played very well by <UNK> <UNK> is broadcast on radio stations across america like a prize fight by <UNK> <UNK> another great fast talking deadpan comic actor of the 1930s br br the bridge players are even in a <UNK> off square though the audience is br br above them unlike in boxing rings br br the wide variety of american types <UNK> the comedies of preston <UNK> though for <UNK> celebrity grand slam most calls to mind two better movies from the same pre code era with lee tracy playing fast talking br br <UNK> the half naked truth and <UNK> but grand slam has its br br moments especially for anyone who has played bridge with serious point br br <UNK> br br loretta young was already a clothes horse to me her face seems a bit long br br and <UNK> too another <UNK> notion of beauty i guess the movie br br unfortunately all but drops glenda farrell who plays <UNK> <UNK> br br girlfriend
<START> a french film <UNK> williams would love but the <UNK> swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris <UNK> finding themselves no question where <UNK> <UNK> lie as all the boys are depicted as <UNK> but actually only the 3 girls are in focus and for the entire time with the few adults and the other <UNK> being mostly in the background marie is a stick of a girl unattractive but determined she wants to be a <UNK> and forces herself on floriane a <UNK> quality beauty per one reviewer and she is also a friend of <UNK> to anna not unattractive but for her the time of her <UNK> perfection was short and now she is an adolescent in a women's body what ensues is a journey to self realization without a road map but there is a <UNK> about the three that is un natural where is the <UNK> and mindless <UNK> of youth while the <UNK> was breath taking with <UNK> self <UNK> beautifully portrayed as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne it all seemed abstract <UNK> puppets
<START> i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid i cried every time i watched it it wasn't weird to me i totally identified with the characters i would love to see it again and hope i wont be disappointed <UNK> rocks i was really drawn in to the fantasy world and to me the movie was <UNK> i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them the acting i thought was strong i loved jack <UNK> he was so dreamy to an 10 year old when i first saw the movie not in 1970 i can still remember the characters vividly the <UNK> was totally believable and i can still <UNK> the evil woods <UNK> poo was scary i wouldn't want to cross her path
<START> this is a dumb movie maybe my judgment wouldn't be so harsh if the film didn't promise so much but i just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn br br i didn't have any <UNK> with the acting but i thought the characters were awful the movie starts off with clive <UNK> character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is and how he planned the perfect bank robbery something he frequently reminds us of later oh yeah he also tells us he's in a prison cell although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong and you're long gone before the police show up but clive <UNK> scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as i can tell he also has to control <UNK> <UNK> with cops and most fantastically of all perform a this old house job on the <UNK> <UNK> and hide out there for a week i hope he brought enough food and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again yeah that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me clive this plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didn't fall apart was the screenwriter said so br br and then there are the many unexplained details why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had <UNK> among the <UNK> who the hell is jodie <UNK> character and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her <UNK> and call and she doesn't have to tell denzel washington her agenda because it's above his pay scale how dumb are these cops that they can't figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery how did the robbers slip away and why did clive owen stick around for a week how did they find out about the bank <UNK> past and the number and <UNK> of his safe <UNK> box why the hell would clive owen let in jodie foster or the cops since when do they make toy <UNK> <UNK> that look real up close how the hell do you bug a pizza box anyway how did clive owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours <UNK> did this <UNK> criminal really feel <UNK> enough to this cop denzel to slip him a diamond br br none of these questions are ever answered there are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off screen but i never felt that way about inside man it felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie or these questions never had any answers in the first place and that's weak particularly annoying is jodie <UNK> character who won't <UNK> what she does but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is we're just supposed to take her word for it i guess br br the only reason i gave this movie two stars is i laughed at <UNK> taxi cab and <UNK> <UNK> gags and at the kid's outrageous video game other than that this movie has no redeeming features
<START> ok this one's a <UNK> honestly i can't tell you all the inner plot points of the beast <UNK> i started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes but just wait it definitely does pick up br br the plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some french aristocrat chick screwed back in the day eventually you see the beast which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat bear costume with a horse <UNK> attached to it the scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep the sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared the beast pops up rapes the chick and shoots 400 <UNK> of <UNK> all over her eventually the chick starts to enjoy the <UNK> attention which results in some pretty novel <UNK> sex scenes including an <UNK> erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman <UNK> the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere yeah i've got a twisted foot fetish so sue me the whole film is told in flashbacks and long <UNK> dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious a shocking but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film br br the beast is a film that i find kind of hard to rate the cinematography itself is quite eye catching and the sets costumes and locations are elaborate the plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick <UNK> a rat bear a good bit of tits ass and hairy 70's french <UNK> to help make up for the dull first half of the film i have to honestly say that if it weren't for the graphic scenes of the beast <UNK> all over the willing maiden this film would have been a real bore that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex the beginning has a very up close and personal scene of two horses <UNK> including a <UNK> and <UNK> covered female horse <UNK> <UNK> but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film that i have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real <UNK> i have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they've seen it all the beast rape really is out there and something to be witnessed also recommended to any fans of 70's 80's sleaze films this one ranks pretty high with them worth a look for you sick rat bear <UNK> lovers out there like me 8 10
<START> normally i would never rent a movie like this because you know it's going to be bad just by looking at the box i rented seven movies at the same time including nightmare on elm street 5 6 and wes craven's new nightmare unfortunately when i got home i found out the <UNK> guy gave me the wrong tape in the box of wes craven's new nightmare i found this lame movie br br this movie is incredibly boring the acting is bad and the plot doesn't make any sense it's hard to write a good review because i have no idea what the movie was really about at the end of the movie you have more questions then answers br br on <UNK> <UNK> scale of 1 to <UNK> i rate this movie 1 br br ps i would like to correct <UNK> review right below mine he says robert englund is ripping off <UNK> riding horses naked etc the guy that did those things was <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> not by robert englund
<START> it figures this is a french film lol with the emphasis on young girls with much older men why is it the french are so <UNK> on this kind of thing when the age difference is this great it really comes off as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is beautiful she bears a strong resemblance to olivia <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> romeo and juliet set in a similar period but she looks about 15 and the actor playing <UNK> her painting <UNK> looks well 50 is kind br br other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record unusually detailed in this case of the real artemisia a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female <UNK> of this period <UNK> century her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age old <UNK> that all great artists were men she pretty much <UNK> that <UNK> to bits and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant not only was she clearly <UNK> and forced into a <UNK> sexual relationship because in those days marriage to your <UNK> was the only way to avoid social shame but <UNK> was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child br br the movie does a terrible <UNK> by <UNK> this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story very dramatic and not in need of any <UNK> up because in some weird <UNK> way it's <UNK> to have an <UNK> teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather that's sexy the truth is boring and seems too feminist politically correct br br it also <UNK> me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film the fact that she painted for decades her famous painting of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was painted after not before the rape that she was the first woman admitted to the <UNK> <UNK> academy that she went on to have children oh that's boring stuff after all that's about a middle aged woman and they aren't hot like teenagers br br i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film or a book about a real historical character you need to create dialog have subplots create dramatic structure certainly some details can be sacrificed it's no big deal if the dates are moved a few years or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress when we know from her self <UNK> that she was a brunette and a big <UNK> one not a skinny <UNK> or something like that but to turn her story around on her and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing it's even worse because the director is female she should be horribly ashamed of herself br br if you like this and i know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex you will probably like dangerous beauty with <UNK> <UNK> and catherine <UNK> similarly based on heavily re written history with lots of <UNK> <UNK> and jewel <UNK> <UNK> bon <UNK>
<START> all of the x men movies were great and i mean all of them including the long hated x men 3 they had solid characters <UNK> and <UNK> were the best ones in my opinion and a good story arch br br i was all excited when i heard this movie was on production and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until i saw the movie i was so disappointed br br hugh jackman is not a bad actor his best movie is the <UNK> although you won't hear about this movie when they talk about the actor and his acting is not what <UNK> the movie up br br the whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot like blob or <UNK> which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics br br i am a fan of <UNK> i have read many many of their stories and this movie respected none of them none not even the continuity it doesn't respect weapon x project or the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> or emma frost the motivations for <UNK> are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies revenge for the death of a loved one br br oh what i was expecting the whole darn movie was a <UNK> moment for <UNK> similar to the one he has in <UNK> in the school when <UNK> men come in and he alone <UNK> the enemy forces but hey this is fox this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome marvel hero br br besides i had a feeling of constant <UNK> <UNK> with this movie because <UNK> origins are already explained in <UNK> we already know how he got his <UNK> <UNK> so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know br br i personally believe that <UNK> is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back story because mystery is the nature of the character do we really want to know how the joker got his <UNK>
<START> i really can't say anything bad or good about this thing its characters are likable enough it's <UNK> produced and designed and professional looking except for that cheesy monster suit however it has no originality no ideas and nothing you haven't seen in alien predator <UNK> and or <UNK> it's just another formula cookie cutter <UNK> corporate <UNK> in deep space versus <UNK> monster flick pretty much a waste of time
<START> this may not be the worst comedy of all time but it's close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it back br br chris <UNK> is funny for about 10 minutes his high pitched voice and mad <UNK> start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snl <UNK> that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably there's not much middle ground in this category although chris <UNK> was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then dead so i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career br br avoid this movie like the plague br br c
<START> well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on <UNK> the 100 scariest movie moments i had long <UNK> to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker <UNK> raines moves into an apartment building that's a <UNK> to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if it's a bit slow it's a mix of the omen and rosemary's baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the <UNK> woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of <UNK> people and cannibals it's a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the 70's even if it's nothing greatly original it's wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites 9 10
<START> it is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been <UNK> and laid <UNK> at the <UNK> of <UNK> from the berlin wall to the <UNK> <UNK> to the cultural revolution to the <UNK> <UNK> one still finds <UNK> of communist <UNK> in hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor it just shows the moral <UNK> of hollywood br br in this particular film a psychotic murderer is <UNK> needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic <UNK> were included that both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable <UNK> film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship
<START> hello i just watched this movie earlier today for the <UNK> time in 3 days i am a history teacher that has <UNK> too much time on my hands i need a life i found the movie containing a striking resemblance to broke back mountain i also found that i look a lot like jean <UNK> if he were white also my favorite line in the entire movie was from mr <UNK> this baby can shoot a <UNK> eye from 300 <UNK> oh and my favorite scene in the movie was when the british were coming in and the one drummer who was so devoted to his work and he <UNK> till the death as if that drum would end the war altogether but it wouldn't well thats all i would like to say about this movie oh one more thing bonnie brown is an insane <UNK> <UNK> mood swinging <UNK> that is all
<START> its not the cast a <UNK> group of actors you could not find its not the setting the director is in love with new york city and by the end of the film so are we all woody allen could not improve upon what <UNK> has done here if you are going to fall in love or find love manhattan is the place to go no the problem with the movie is the script there is none the actors fall in love at first sight words are unnecessary in the director's own experience in hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set it is reality to him and his peers but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world so in the end the movie is hollow and shallow and message less
<START> if you can believe it another group of teens return to another <UNK> cabin three years after another one of those fatal <UNK> claimed one of their number low and behold a psycho wearing a <UNK> hockey mask a cheap <UNK> one at that turns up to waste them one by one this mechanical <UNK> the <UNK> knock off gained slight <UNK> as one of the first <UNK> shot features but that's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable amateur production with sub par performances and a recurring boom <UNK> <UNK> a last second twist does little to lift the spirits and <UNK> <UNK> is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about one for insane slasher <UNK> only
<START> this mini series also based on a book by alex <UNK> as was <UNK> tried to use similar <UNK> that is <UNK> a long history following the lives of a family over many years whereas in <UNK> the result was masterful here in mama <UNK> the inspiration was lacking firstly perhaps in the book itself and most certainly in this tv production too much is put in with too much <UNK> over the years such that the unfolding saga is shallow superficial not nearly so authentic as in <UNK> full marks for the <UNK> in the earlier parts of the film which was prepared with great care but as the film progressed it seemed to <UNK> into a kind of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mix in the last third of its three hours or so duration i had hoped for more but evidently <UNK> was less inspired with this tale than his near <UNK> <UNK> and peter <UNK> iii is no match for john <UNK> only <UNK> for those who have an <UNK> for these lengthy tales of generations growing up
<START> anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a <UNK> that the events we're about to see can't ever be known and this is the <UNK> <UNK> most often told about one of hollywood's most sensational mysteries br br okay so we're not getting anything new and e 's mysteries <UNK> gives you a better <UNK> on the particular incident and that's not much of an <UNK> what do we get br br we learn that hollywood is a nest of <UNK> and <UNK> no big news there more interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and or political establishment it raises the question of whether peter bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters but what's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled we're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of <UNK> that passes itself off as history br br the tone of the film has a curious <UNK> quality that i found more irritating than fun we're not <UNK> with anyone and the great citizen kane <UNK> off the relationship between davies and hearts in a much more convincing way in the <UNK> <UNK> we're not ever sure of davies motives for being with <UNK> as soon as we're told one thing she's off doing the other br br and are we to believe that davies was the love of <UNK> life or is he just trying to <UNK> one of america's most powerful and apparently moronic citizens the film never makes it clear br br what is convincing are the production values there's a glorious recreation of the <UNK> and period costumes i got more out of looking at the construction of some of the <UNK> on the men's <UNK> than following a story that <UNK> many of the the most well known personalities in hollywood history no one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction the <UNK> that frame the film only make it all the more <UNK> and unsatisfying br br the performers can't be <UNK> although meg <UNK> goes way past parody here kirsten dunst never disappoints she gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing only joanna <UNK> rises above the material but so much so that she seems to be <UNK> herself from the whole enterprise rather than <UNK> it one of her first lines is i'm not here and i'm sure she wishes she wasn't br br this isn't on par with <UNK> trashy so bad it's good at long last love it's <UNK> on attempting something serious but <UNK> and stumbles <UNK> because it's so full of <UNK> towards the beast named hollywood this is national <UNK> filmmaking and it not only <UNK> the names of those who the film places on board the <UNK> that weekend but the audience gets pretty dirty as well
<START> one previous reviewer called this film pure visual joy i am wondering if s he saw the same film that i did high art had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since seven one can almost forgive <UNK> and mitchell for the cliché of going to a b b for their first time of course before they do that one has to watch <UNK> <UNK> parties inhabited by people who are not apparently <UNK> employed but can somehow support a <UNK> drug habit not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types the girlfriend boyfriend at start who are well aware they're going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so the movie also states that the <UNK> character has retired from professional photography for ten years now what did she do <UNK> at age twenty
<START> i've always believed that david and <UNK> was a film originally intended for <UNK> power at 20th century fox although gregory peck does give a good account of himself as king david the <UNK> with a wandering eye br br a whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film adultery redemption sin punishment and generally what god expects from his followers br br when you're a king even king in a <UNK> <UNK> kingdom you certainly do have a lot <UNK> not open to the rest of us king david has many wives including one really vicious one in <UNK> meadows who was the daughter of <UNK> david's predecessor but his eyes catch sight of <UNK> out in her garden one evening turns out she's as <UNK> married to <UNK> the <UNK> as david is to quite a few women <UNK> is one of david's army <UNK> david sends for <UNK> and him being the king she comes a <UNK> because she's had her eye on him too br br what happens an affair a <UNK> and a carefully arranged death for <UNK> in a battle but an all seeing and knowing <UNK> has caught all of this and is not only <UNK> david and <UNK> but the entire kingdom of israel is being <UNK> with <UNK> disease and <UNK> br br the sexist law of the day calls for <UNK> to have a <UNK> death david shows weakness in his previous actions but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him he even lays hands on the <UNK> of the <UNK> which was an instant death as seen in the film br br my interpretation of it is that god <UNK> guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on david and <UNK> them both <UNK> becomes the mother of <UNK> and she and david are the <UNK> of several <UNK> in the divided <UNK> of israel and <UNK> until they're both <UNK> br br susan <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> caught in a <UNK> marriage with <UNK> played by <UNK> moore the only thing that gets moore <UNK> is a good battle i liked <UNK> moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid <UNK> rear br br no one can lay the law down like raymond massey his nathan the prophet is in keeping with the john brown character he played in two films same intensity br br so when his own law called for death why did god spare <UNK> and keep david on the throne maybe it was the fact he just didn't want to train a third guy for the job he'd replaced <UNK> with david already br br but i think the christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the new testament <UNK> that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it <UNK> i'll leave it to the biblical <UNK> to submit interpretations br br watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory
<START> this was keaton's first feature and is in <UNK> three shorts set in different periods stone age roman age modern age on the eternal triangle of romance the stories parallel each other as in <UNK> <UNK> which this was intended to <UNK> the strengths of the jokes and gags almost all rely on <UNK> bringing modern day business into ancient settings br br warning spoilers follow to elaborate best points br br here are the classic moments br br using a turtle as a wee gee board stone age a <UNK> watch containing a sun <UNK> roman age a <UNK> with a spare wheel roman age using a helmet as a tire lock roman age early golf with <UNK> and rocks stone age <UNK> a will being <UNK> into a rock stone age the changing weather <UNK> roman age the <UNK> race in snow buster using <UNK> and <UNK> with a spare dog in the <UNK> boot roman age br br the above are all throw away gags that keep us <UNK> there are however unforgettable moments as well br br buster taking out <UNK> equipment to match girl putting on make up the fantastic double take when an <UNK> buster <UNK> at his plate to discover a <UNK> staring up at him within one second he has <UNK> to stand on his chair from a sitting position and <UNK> again into the arms of the <UNK> one of the funniest moments i've ever seen and that lion the <UNK> just brilliant br br there's also an off color bit of racism when four african american <UNK> <UNK> abandon their mistress for a roman crap game br br <UNK> print is a bit fuzzy and contains numerous sequences of both <UNK> <UNK> and film damage most probably at ends of <UNK> the <UNK> feature is scored with piano and <UNK> and borrows heavily from <UNK> br br lots of fun and full of laughs
<START> definitely an odd debut for michael madsen madsen plays cecil moe an alcoholic family man whose life is <UNK> all around him cecil grabs a phone book looks up the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night he goes to the <UNK> home and <UNK> his problems the preacher teaches cecil to respect the word of god and have jesus in his heart that makes everything all better <UNK> if only everything in life were that easy the fact that this film looks as if it was made with about 500 certainly doesn't help 1 10
<START> unlike <UNK> <UNK> two other current game shows deal or no deal and 1 vs 100 the pacing in this show is way too slow for what is happening on the screen br br <UNK> and 1 vs 100 can get away with slow pacing because the games can change pace or end at any moment there is risk involved in every action the player takes the <UNK> are wildly <UNK> and it is difficult for the players to leave with a significant amount of money suspense is usually put to good use br br show me the money on the other hand is just too slow paced when a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer you can rest assured that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes it would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer first and then have the player <UNK> a dancer instead of <UNK> wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they're right the random dancing is filler that actually feels like filler too much time is wasted while not enough is happening and the fact that players cannot choose to quit the game early <UNK> that there will be a lot of time wasted br br oh and i have no interest in watching <UNK> shake his groove <UNK> especially right after i've eaten dinner br br i am a <UNK> game show fan but even i had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this it either needs major changes or early retirement
<START> even if 99 99 of people that has seen this movie is brazilian i'll keep up with the english since it is the language of this website br br this movie is a piece of <UNK> p worst acting i have seen for a <UNK> time the kids are terrible specially the boy this was the first time i saw someone with less facial expression than arnold <UNK> and one single voice tone like a 5 years old kid reading in front of the class how can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie the storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better she is 3 <UNK> old it is so simple it could be written in a <UNK> and told in 3 minutes br br there are only three possibilities for someone enjoy this movie 1 you are a pre teen 2 you have been so <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> that you think that anything that has the <UNK> seal is awesome 3 you have a serious brain damage br br avoid at all costs a shame to the brazilian movie scene
<START> this movie start quite <UNK> with a female being bound and psychologically tortured there's male full frontal nudity dead animal parts dogs <UNK> <UNK> the female <UNK> control of her <UNK> all shot in a gray cold color effective but a little too much we then move on to seeing the btk killer's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it's creepy here we don't see fancy or good imagery it looks as if shot with your home camera it doesn't look horrifying but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling what this movie doesn't have is any drama really there are some cop scenes every once in a while but there's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer there isn't much of an arc to this story this could have been an effective psychological thriller a study of madness unfortunately the movie is filled with real <UNK> footage it's <UNK> throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look away and that i have to reject i'm all for low budget horror movies but i don't tolerate animal suffering it was unnecessary excessive and comes without warning i'm glad that <UNK> releases stuff that no one else does but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore stay away from this garbage
<START> in my case i liked this movie because when i saw it i found more than i expected i mean this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its themes even long after i finished it talks about death vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you like a punch in your face even reaching to suffer with the dream sequence in the mid point of the film that's what makes this movie so good the ability unique in don <UNK> director to play with the people's feelings and make them love or hate a character in no time that and the fact that it has so many good characters like charlie and ann marie that in the sad but happy ending you have to say i have something in my eye to hide the others that you cried all i've said are just only some of the good points of this movie as for the rest you have to see them for yourself in a film extremely honest don <UNK> thank you
<START> it is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girl br br this film has a nice concept the modern version of sleeping beauty with a twist it has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his <UNK> a nice start you might say but then it got a bit greedy very greedy it tries to be a science fiction a drama a thriller a possible romantic love story fairy tale a comedy and everything under the sun the result just left the audience feeling rather <UNK> for example the scene when the girl played by <UNK> <UNK> finally <UNK> by his <UNK> <UNK> kiss instead of being romantic it <UNK> to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards it is a cheap trick because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film br br i have not read the original story the film is base on it is the well known work by the comic book artist <UNK> <UNK> is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories i wonder if all the problems <UNK> in the original story or did it occur in the adaption it is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the <UNK> logic of those japanese comic book for instance how did <UNK> <UNK> character manage to get to the hospital in an instant when its suppose to be a long bus ride away to run away <UNK> <UNK> character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television br br there are also some scenes that is directly copied very <UNK> from other films and they all seem rather <UNK> annoying ie the famous the lion mouth has <UNK> my hand scene from the roman holiday br br the film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie nevertheless one should give it credit that it has managed to <UNK> some of the sentiment of the japanese teenager br br it is by watching this film i have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age it would have <UNK> been on the poster of this film br br
<START> this movie's origins are a mystery to me as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it i assume that before starship troopers <UNK> was one of the countless <UNK> pilots that never made it to network cable or otherwise the new title of kill shot is <UNK> thrown into the opening sequence the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema the quick cuts cheesy <UNK> place music and short 2 second close up <UNK> shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for br br and i don't mind at all i rented this movie seeing the <UNK> that puts casper van <UNK> and denise richards on the cover in front of a <UNK> net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book in my opinion not so hot a movie but that's another review after looking it up on imdb my roommate and i <UNK> that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bond girl and wild things references here they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the <UNK> r rated status <UNK> in suspense video rental sections that is in any event they should have left it <UNK> if you're trying to sell it in the suspense <UNK> porn section br br all in all it's entertaining i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a tv pilot though that was the biggest pull while watching it when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual br br would i rent it again no would i watch this tv show well why not it's better than <UNK> and their <UNK> attempts at hitting all <UNK> would have done well back in the mid 90s token black guy who's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter racial dating token asian japanese i assume from the name <UNK> more <UNK> at science and computers than talking to women beautiful intelligent <UNK> pre <UNK> student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account this show probably would have done ok br br but as a movie it just cracks me br br i gave it a 7 out of 10 considering what it was and what it was forced to become it made for a very enjoyable evening and that's all i ask of <UNK>
<START> it's heart warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males in this one the wife mother leaves her family to get in touch with herself or pursue her <UNK> the father stays with and <UNK> the kids letting neither his work nor his love life <UNK> with his love of and responsibility to them
<START> using footage <UNK> from planet of dinosaurs this shot on video except for the stolen footage concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that is don't wait for it is really earth its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes slightly better than <UNK> another in the bad movie police series having a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects this movie is still an impossible <UNK> to get through i'm left to <UNK> the question are we becoming so <UNK> that we're now <UNK> old movies not only for plot but also for <UNK> footage clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money
<START> <UNK> whenever a person heard his name his first thought would be <UNK> that is what this man is known for or rather was known for after giving <UNK> blockbuster comedies like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his train <UNK> slowly with movies like <UNK> <UNK> and a few others whose names i can't <UNK> for now now with hideous films like <UNK> the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be <UNK> br br <UNK> is a mixture of bad unfunny toilet jokes somewhat of drama poor suspense and <UNK> the only good thing about <UNK> was one or two of the scenes which were funny though not witty and secondly except for <UNK> <UNK> and the hysterical grandma the acting was decent br br speaking of the acting i felt that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were at the top if you compare them with the others in the movie then came <UNK> kapoor then <UNK> and at the last the two idiots mentioned above the flaw in <UNK> <UNK> was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting the grandma firstly <UNK> a ghost plus she was not funny at all but rather silly br br the plot was the same seen before one four boys behind girls and in need of money but with a few twists there is a <UNK> man who is <UNK> stupid and dumb and at last the good wins over the bad and everything is fine the idea of having a <UNK> with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty br br the worst thing about the movie is its length after an hour or so you get exhausted and want to leave the theater but being a critic it is my responsibility to <UNK> the whole two and half hours of the movie the movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are <UNK> just at a different place br br if your mother in law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything then send her for this movie and have fun 3 out of 10
<START> i like movies about <UNK> which is why i recently decided to <UNK> eyes behind the stars after seeing it when i was a kid back in the late 1970s and now i'm compelled to write a review about it because i'm afraid i'll start forgetting everything about it fast you see even though <UNK> ain't bad it's very dull and <UNK> the story is sorta interesting but flat the actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing the fx are terribly amateurish but i can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling which unfortunately this one ain't br br also there's very little violence and there's no nudity whatsoever which makes this 1970s italian sci fi <UNK> a true <UNK> because if there's one thing that <UNK> italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade it's the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them oddly enough because of the almost complete lack of <UNK> elements <UNK> stands out from the rest of the <UNK> i don't know if this can be seen as a compliment though personally i can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but i think <UNK> needed more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry and the special effects aren't that special br br the story itself is actually interesting it's a <UNK> of the x files and <UNK> <UNK> a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country the aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth the problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently <UNK> <UNK> apartment this taking place just before she's to be <UNK> herself the man takes some of the <UNK> and leaves with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing <UNK> the whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the <UNK> the majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue in the spy vs spy variety the <UNK> element of the story is almost <UNK> and could have easily been replaced by any cold war <UNK> but as dull as eyes behind the stars is it does resemble the x files a lot i wonder if chris carter saw this movie anyway the best thing in <UNK> are the <UNK> shots which are creepy and effective but the rest is almost completely forgettable including the goofy looking aliens br br even though i've been mostly negative about this film i sorta <UNK> it nonetheless i still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when i saw it as a kid and i own the video the film could have been so much more if it had been done properly oh well
<START> i must admit i do not hold much of new age <UNK> <UNK> when people exchange energy i always wonder how much <UNK> is actually <UNK> and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem when energy is <UNK> i always wonder how they managed to <UNK> the laws of <UNK> and still are without <UNK> <UNK> when people feel how well instinct <UNK> them to <UNK> <UNK> through the <UNK> of life i wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station br br but then again this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them i find perfectly acceptable and entertaining if this were the case with the <UNK> prophecy i wouldn't burn this movie down but unfortunately it isn't every actor seems to be bored out of his head and unable to grasp what he are actually supposed to be doing on location this results in many ah s and oh s like i tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what he is talking about and pretend to understand br br the direction is uninspired as well you might expect something more from the guy who did what dreams may come but hey i supposed he got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a new york taxi driver it's your money buddy the only one who seems to be having fun is all time bad guy <UNK> <UNK> not only does he have a job he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring new age <UNK> br br this movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up at one moment in time it seems the words turn into small <UNK> <UNK> balls that are thrown to your head <UNK> until it hurts br br if you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety <UNK> in your <UNK> take my advise choose the latter
<START> of the many problems with this film the worst is continuity and re editing it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing how much longer to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously br br that's <UNK> what could the <UNK> have possibly been trying to accomplish here their previous film white zombie was a successful low budget attempt to <UNK> the early universal studios monster films the mummy dracula etc and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazines br br revolt of the zombies to the contrary appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war this would not only explain the opening and the change of dean <UNK> character into a <UNK> but it also explains why the zombies don't actually do much in the film besides stand around look frightening and wait for orders they're just <UNK> soldiers not the undead cannibals we've all come to love and <UNK> in zombie films br br i am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics but i think a film ought to be entertaining first and only later maybe educational and definitely a film about zombies ought to be about zombies br br truly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history but not one i can recommend even for historic value
<START> this was one of those wonderful rare moments in t v that i wished i'd captured forever on vhs won't it ever air again br br it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating i want to see it all again i want to buy it i want what i can't have not even on ebay br br so having <UNK> enough it was by far one of the best series the 80's put out it should be considered a classic but is lost in space at least this website and <UNK> mention it <UNK> br br it was utterly appealing funny <UNK> and original maybe not like sherlock holmes original i actually think <UNK> is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and <UNK> holmes ever could
<START> if you liked the first two films then i'm sorry to say you're not going to like this one this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video probably tv made sequel the still idiotic but nice scientist wayne <UNK> rick <UNK> is still living with his family and he has his own company <UNK> inc unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue wayne is so stupid he <UNK> his statue and himself with his brother then he <UNK> his wife and sister in law too now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things e g a toy car roller coaster swimming in <UNK> etc pretty poor
<START> words can't describe how bad this movie is i can't explain it by writing only you have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be not that i recommend you to do that there are so many clichés mistakes and all other negative things you can imagine here that will just make you cry to start with the technical first there are a lot of mistakes regarding the airplane i won't list them here but just mention the <UNK> of the plane they didn't even manage to show an <UNK> in the colors of a fictional <UNK> but instead used a <UNK> painted in the original <UNK> <UNK> very bad the plot is stupid and has been done many times before only much much better there are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early also i was on the bad <UNK> side all the time in the movie because the good guys were so stupid executive decision should without a doubt be you're choice over this one even the <UNK> movies are better in fact every other movie in the world is better than this one
<START> after <UNK> <UNK> first work im <UNK> which was fairly good he created a really gorgeous italian family epic its a german movie which is unfortunately a bad <UNK> cause we <UNK> produce more than <UNK> movies but this movie makes some very good <UNK> of the time then <UNK> is about a italian immigrant who arrives in the <UNK> region of germany during the 60s the immigrant and his family then start the first pizza restaurant in the region the characters are excellent drawn especially <UNK> the main actor you live every second every feeling he does his brother played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that good well you just dont believe him the role but the character is <UNK> and fits perfectly into this script i feel an <UNK> need to compare the style of this movie with the style of the godfather many people will probably hate this movie say its boring not much tension yes but an outrageous movie 9 out of 10
<START> using buster keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice he may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age this gives him a chance to display those talents in a little time travel story he get hooked up with a guy living in modern times and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our own times keaton is able to do his sight gags very well i've heard his voice before i believe he did some of those beach party films playing some vacuous characters just to earn a few bucks <UNK> seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way it's not a bad story it shows how one <UNK> when we wish for something we don't have and get that wish
<START> every sunday a trio of <UNK> get together at a nyc diner to <UNK> about their sexual <UNK> of the night before sometimes they're joined by a <UNK> ex <UNK> and <UNK> hunter who hangs on them like a <UNK> <UNK> they're <UNK> horn dogs corn dogs and <UNK> who witnesses them on the <UNK> decides that they need to be taught a lesson <UNK> <UNK> she'll date and dump why not all three of them br br gasp what a wild idea what a radical naughty gal women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to as much as men do even br br there is one <UNK> laughable element in whipped namely the fact that not once during the <UNK> detailed discussions of their <UNK> functions and the <UNK> talents of the bed partners they trash do the other customers in the diner turn around and say dude we're trying to eat here indeed a <UNK> <UNK> gag has an older lady eagerly <UNK> in on the useful sexual <UNK> of certain <UNK> a big fat <UNK> the frog <UNK> to that br br it's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting a smart cute heroine and three possible <UNK> had to have such a cop out ending br br p s 30 whip <UNK> sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase you go girl it was tired in 2000 and it's tired now br br save your time and watch some sex and the city reruns
<START> just to mention one more thing about gentleman jim i agree with all the <UNK> that make this among errol <UNK> greatest <UNK> in a career of great <UNK> i would think this role playing boxer jim corbett is more like his real personality than the <UNK> he was <UNK> as flynn seemed like a party animal from his <UNK> and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life the extra thing i wanted to point out is notice the great montages transitions and still <UNK> that <UNK> the film although the director was <UNK> walsh a frequent <UNK> with flynn with cinematographer sid <UNK> the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named don <UNK> i never knew <UNK> went that far back but he's listed right in the credits he would go on to a great career as action director himself
<START> to me the final scene in which harris responds to the press <UNK> is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics especially the campaign phase if only the real life <UNK> would respond in the intelligent <UNK> manner as did mr harris then the arrogant self serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before <UNK> irrelevant <UNK> garbage that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he she is pursuing
<START> <UNK> is one movie i remember for it's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970's as i am exactly jodie <UNK> age i related to this movie it deals with the <UNK> <UNK> relationships rebellion of youth the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock <UNK> more than a feeling by boston and sad numbers like on the radio by donna summer the music of my late teens yep i'll always remember this one even if it wasn't huge
<START> flavia la <UNK> <UNK> aka flavia the <UNK> of 1974 is a truly disturbing and <UNK> piece of italian exploitation cinema that to a certain extent follows a somewhat feminist premise though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of <UNK> set mostly in a convent and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist great performance by the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> flavia the <UNK> may be referred to as a <UNK> film however this film <UNK> quite drastically from the typical <UNK> flicks from the time as it doesn't so much focus on the <UNK> elements such as <UNK> sadistic lesbian <UNK> etc personally i saw more similarities to the <UNK> flicks of the time such as mark of the devil even though this one doesn't treat the topic of witch <UNK> which focus on the brutal execution of christian <UNK> in the middle ages and early modern period br br italy around <UNK> after witnessing her <UNK> father <UNK> a wounded muslim soldier young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent when her father <UNK> a fellow nun to a <UNK> death for a small <UNK> years later <UNK> disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the <UNK> church and she joins a band of <UNK> <UNK> br br one thing is for sure flavia the <UNK> is not for the faint hearted and neither is it for those who want happy endings director <UNK> <UNK> obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible especially in its nasty scenes the many torture and execution scenes are extremely disturbing with <UNK> <UNK> and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film the violence here is never superfluous however after all this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in the film is very well made with realistic costumes fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by <UNK> <UNK> the stunningly beautiful and great <UNK> <UNK> has proved her talent in many great italian cult productions including lucio <UNK> giallo masterpiece non <UNK> <UNK> un <UNK> of 1972 she delivers another great charismatic performance here and i couldn't imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does the film has some minor inconsistencies e g why does the rigid church let bizarre cult followers into <UNK> in the first place however it is overall amazing how realistic this film is flavia the <UNK> should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema this is a great exploitation flick overall though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema 7 5 10
<START> i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in <UNK> kentucky when i was a boy the scene where dr <UNK> finds the <UNK> coffin and the breathing dead body <UNK> was the scariest part of the movie for me only <UNK> by the darkness of the film i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the <UNK> was changed from <UNK> due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many <UNK> of various people sir thomas <UNK> seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in <UNK> the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers
<START> i cannot believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was i wrong the plot was abysmal the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess however i cannot lie some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the asian boy says <UNK> i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f stereotypes <UNK> br br please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates
<START> the fight scenes were great loved the old and newer <UNK> and how they painted the ones on their side it was the ending that i hated i was disappointed that it was earth but <UNK> years back but to travel all that way just to start over are you kidding me <UNK> people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise they abandon technology no way sure they were eating paper and <UNK> food but that is over they can live like humans again they only have one good doctor what are they going to do when someone has a tooth <UNK> never mind giving birth <UNK> right no one would have made that choice
<START> it might have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the russian group t a t u coincidence i don't think so there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous you know the recipe the other actors well i just don't know what their role is supposed to be most of them are well known people in romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors e g <UNK> <UNK> so to <UNK> it girl band <UNK> desperate publicity needing actors a non existing plot the occasion to use bad language in order to shock love sick too bad the idea was good though and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title
<START> this is an astounding film as well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to <UNK> chavez we are given the background picture which describes a class divided society many of the rich it appears have a choice with the people's <UNK> choice and are willing to use the military for regime change <UNK> careful what you say in front of your <UNK> is a revealing comment the head of the country's biggest oil company <UNK> himself as the new president with us backing and these young irish film makers have it all on camera a great film to <UNK> young people about democracy we see transparent <UNK> of how media can be manipulated and force used in the interests of big business against the interests of the <UNK> wishes of the people riveting stuff
<START> i thought that this film was very enjoyable i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child therefore i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still thoroughly enjoyed it it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so then they were obviously going to be disappointed this is simply an animated movie nothing more if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained you will not be disappointed in closing this is definitely not the best movie disney has made but it is entertaining and i do not understand the bad reputation it has received
<START> worst movie ever made please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film i find the positive comments very misleading i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech don't waste your hard earned money this film is retarded i can't believe a film like this would ever be made why would hollywood waste their time on such junk this film is an attempt at nothing i ask myself what <UNK> would actually sink their money producing such trash i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money i didn't listen and i did waste my time and cash please don't make the same mistake it really is the worst movie ever made
<START> in the words of charles <UNK> character in this film <UNK> no plot no character development and utterly unbelievable br br full of stuff that just doesn't happen in the real world since when were british police <UNK> armed with <UNK> in shoulder <UNK> full of mistakes <UNK> trains in london full of dull and artificial dialogue and the directing editing is awful <UNK> hand held camera shots that add nothing to the film except a vague feeling of <UNK> confusing jump cuts no structure br br wesley <UNK> character is totally unsympathetic why should we care what happens to him direct to video direct to the <UNK>
<START> it's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn off for bored audiences it's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too <UNK> to watch i'm sorry but i do not see the <UNK> in this just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one liners well i'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced probably as dumb as that sheriff who <UNK> into the pickup truck full of <UNK> with a <UNK> bloody wound <UNK> did i forget to mention this <UNK> not only a poor actor but also can <UNK> off an <UNK> with a load of <UNK> <UNK> the exposed flesh i guess he kind of forgot when he won a not so thrilling victory over the snowman
<START> peter fonda is so intentionally <UNK> as an actor that his <UNK> line <UNK> <UNK> out any irony or humor in the dialogue he <UNK> sassy <UNK> and non witty <UNK> with brooke <UNK> as if he were a wooden block with <UNK> hair even his smaller touches like <UNK> a non existent mustache on his <UNK> face don't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself an unsure filmmaker in the <UNK> circa 1950 a poor <UNK> not above a little cheating wins an <UNK> would be teen <UNK> in a <UNK> poker game after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the grand canyon the <UNK> <UNK> become <UNK> some lovely <UNK> and an odd but interesting cameo by henry fonda as a <UNK> canyon man are the sole <UNK> in <UNK> comedy drama with the two leads being <UNK> by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map <UNK> is very pretty but although the camera loves her <UNK> glossy beauty she has no screen presence and her <UNK> voice has no range whatsoever every time she opens her mouth one is inclined to either cringe or duck 1 2 from
<START> i <UNK> that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating <UNK> the trailer for this movie has completely <UNK> no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and everyone who actually saw it that i know absolutely loved it the advertising campaign is disgrace disaster <UNK> br br opened at 4 behind br br 1 rush hour which i have not seen average imdb score of 7 4 br br 2 the <UNK> ultimatum which i have seen awesome movie but 3rd week out average imdb score of 8 7 deserving i would say br br 3 the simpsons movie which i have seen okay movie but 4th week out average imdb score of 8 1 a bit high in my opinion br br 4 stardust average imdb score of 8 4 lower then <UNK> but that's been our for 3 weeks br br whether it was poor <UNK> or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy fairytale and not advertised as just another <UNK> too bad anyway now that i have very <UNK> <UNK> on and on awesome movie go see it
<START> this movie had good intentions and a good story to work with the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull boring <UNK> that made me feel like i was back in mr <UNK> <UNK> grade social studies class way back in <UNK> br br what a waste will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it the story deserves it br br every time a scene had potential all we were left with were a few clichés combined with black and white footage that they probably got from the history channel to show the action shameful br br <UNK> davis was the only bright light in this dull fest the other acting was incredibly dull it fit in with the movie well and <UNK> played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery br br however if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and aren't concerned with being <UNK> or entertained but want to learn about the <UNK> mason it is worth a watch
<START> a fine western following the fate of those who possess the prize winning gun a winchester '73 it has a great cast who give superb cliche <UNK> with help from the usual effective story telling direction from mann
<START> i don't know where to begin tara reid needs to be stopped before she's put in another movie stephen <UNK> looks like he got his character's motivation from val kilmer in top gun slater <UNK> through this dreck the direction editing sound do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a <UNK> costumes <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> on them and hey there's no discernible plot either it <UNK> me that no one attached to the project stopped and said hey guys this just doesn't make any sense let's start over hopefully <UNK> career can <UNK> from this disaster br br hands down the worst film i've ever seen
<START> i had no idea that mr izzard was so damn funny it really <UNK> the mind that he is not more well known his command over the crowd and his timing is perfect the monologue about star wars will kill ya too if only all the stand up performers had his wit
<START> ghost town starts as kate <UNK> catherine <UNK> drives along an isolated desert road her car suddenly breaks down she hears horses <UNK> approaching deputy sheriff <UNK> frank <UNK> of <UNK> county is called in to investigate <UNK> disappearance after her father reports her missing he finds her broken down car drives off looking for her unfortunately his car breaks down too he has to walk <UNK> ends up at at a deserted <UNK> ghost town much to his shock <UNK> soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as it's populated by the ghosts of it's former residents is run by the evil <UNK> <UNK> f <UNK> who has kidnapped kate for reasons never explained it's up to <UNK> to rescue her end the towns curse br br the one only directorial effort of richard <UNK> this odd film didn't really do much for me i didn't like it all that much the script by duke <UNK> tries to mix the horror western genres which it doesn't do to any great effect have you ever wondered why there aren't more horror western hybrid films out there well neither have i but if i were to ask myself such a question i would find all the answers in ghost town because it's not very good the two genres just don't mix that well there are plenty of clichés on the western side of things there's the innocent <UNK> who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are <UNK> them the shoot outs in the main street saloon bars with swing doors prostitutes upstairs horror wise there's plenty of <UNK> some ghosts an ancient curse talking corpses a few violent kills i was just very <UNK> by it i suppose there's nothing terribly wrong with it other than it's just dull the two genres don't sit together that well there are a few holes in the plot too why did <UNK> kidnap kate i know she <UNK> his previous girlfriend but how did he know that what was he going to do with her anyway we never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either i mean what's keeping them there what caused them to come back as ghosts then there's the bit at the end where <UNK> after being shot says he can't be killed only for <UNK> to kill him a few seconds later i mean why didn't the bullets work in the first place br br director <UNK> does alright there's a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit <UNK> <UNK> sets the standard hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings <UNK> either side of it i wouldn't say it's scary because it isn't there's not much tension either the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length forget about any gore there a few bloody <UNK> wounds an after the fact shot of two people with their throats <UNK> someone is <UNK> with a metal pole that's it br br i'd have imagined the budget was pretty small here it's reasonably well made is competent if nothing else credit where <UNK> due the period costumes sets are pretty good actually the acting is alright but no ones going to win any awards br br ghost town is a strange film i'm not really sure who it's meant to appeal to it certainly didn't appeal to me anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements it's something a bit different but that doesn't mean it's any good worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it
<START> maybe it's just because i have an intense fear of <UNK> and medical stuff but this one got under my skin <UNK> the pun this piece is brave not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the <UNK> and lots of sympathy towards the <UNK> i felt myself cringe and feel <UNK> of disgust at certain <UNK> which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself some parts are very <UNK> of <UNK> but come off as tribute rather than imitation it's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider but i enjoy being <UNK> by a film once and awhile this piece brings it and doesn't <UNK> i liked this one a lot do not watch whilst eating <UNK>
<START> i love the newer episodes with <UNK> and <UNK> i also liked the storyline with kate falling for the principal i want to find out what happens to <UNK> and <UNK> and bridget and the family next i think <UNK> is very funny and i love his scenes with <UNK> i have always loved james garner in everything he does and it is a credit to his acting that i never think of him as james garner or <UNK> in this series and totally believe in him as <UNK> dad this family is so real and funny it was terribly sad when john ritter paul <UNK> died but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written into the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely <UNK> and lovingly dealt with but generally a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun
<START> you'll probably never see it but the uncut version is about 50 better than the one you can buy put it another way once you've seen it in its original form the current version is only half as good br br it's still wildly creative and sick a total success on so many levels br br
<START> a noble effort i guess but ultimately a poor one before seeing this film i felt <UNK> the <UNK> was <UNK> after seeing it i still do unfortunately i think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on and they will be upset at the film's needless <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> to 1970 moving from new york to london even the superb talents of paul <UNK> can't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film <UNK> <UNK> classic
<START> we bought this film from a shop called <UNK> we were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film no big deal an remade it br br we expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube however this was shocking boring is the main word that comes to mind the bad effects and script aren't enough to make you watch it the main woman's body seems to be whipped out at <UNK> moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested however it just makes you wonder did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off if so i'd have asked for a <UNK> it looks like a <UNK> film the shots don't even <UNK> with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional i cannot believe that this is being sold as a <UNK> product br br it is just boring and ugly to watch the actors are bad and there is no degree of <UNK> about it there are no words to describe how terrible it is
<START> this film is self indulgent rubbish watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken <UNK> or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed it should be charming but isn't it's just irritating the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor the stories within the film are also <UNK> and sinister i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my <UNK> year old daughter it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us br br although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war there isn't even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland
<START> i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga compelling storyline cool soundtrack directing <UNK> rocks editing and not to mention the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> who filled the part perfectly so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2 but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the <UNK> and lost the ticket azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off however these are completely 2 different movies the pace is a lot slower the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further <UNK> the value of the <UNK> monster franchise if that is possible i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity if only <UNK> <UNK> continued with this installment there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off even the real bad guys get killed off too easily without too much of a fight the fight with the spider guy straight out of an episode of monkey in the <UNK> forest was about the only memorable fight scene <UNK> in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape <UNK> <UNK> rampage at the end was unconvincing but <UNK> still does an okay job she looks great in the cape but where did she get it from i don't think i will be watching this one over and over again what a pity
<START> i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the <UNK> island international film festival and was very impressed tess <UNK> is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films if she could do what she did with the budget of this film i'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture kudos to the cast for their terrific performances that little girl was gold and to whoever composed the music the <UNK> row your boat blew me away very creative film all around i really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i'd buy it in a second if you get the chance you should definitely see this film
<START> i saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than caine believes although it's not much cop <UNK> greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role which is a pity as he might have <UNK> it with more conviction in his playing rex harrison seems even less bothered perhaps <UNK> as his character is very poorly written william <UNK> is better but his screen time is fleeting and again his character is not well scripted br br beverly johnson is as beautiful a woman as i have ever seen but is given very little to do the film might have gained a great deal by <UNK> more on her story ustinov steals the show but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone the music is poor and omar <UNK> makes one of his many pointless cameos his career has been based on this for decades now br br richard <UNK> has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively he was an <UNK> unpredictable film director and this is one of his weaker movies
<START> terrible use of scene cuts all continuity is lost either by awful scripting or <UNK> direction that villainous robot <UNK> been a jazz dancer also one of the worst sound tracks i've ever heard monologues usually drowned out by music and <UNK> they get their props that ship looks like a milk <UNK> i did better special effects on <UNK> at the age of 13 br br i'd recommend any film student should watch this flick 5 minutes at a time so as to learn how not to produce a film or was it the <UNK> fault br br it's really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept just poorly executed all the way around sorry <UNK> you should have sent a stunt double you're too good an actor for such a stink bomb
<START> painting is seeing then remembering better than you saw so says dick <UNK> ronald colman the painter in the light that failed the movie is in the grand old hollywood style starring ronald colman and a <UNK> supporting cast that includes <UNK> <UNK> in her first important role <UNK> character actor dudley <UNK> who also co starred with colman in condemned and a solid performance by the wonderful actor walter huston br br the title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that dick will lose his sight he's <UNK> by gun <UNK> <UNK> as he and childhood sweetheart <UNK> muriel <UNK> are playing with a pistol later a wound while fighting in the <UNK> is the <UNK> for his <UNK> he becomes a famous painter but he's already <UNK> by ambition and doesn't really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him enter bad girl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his self destruction is set in motion <UNK> is very powerful in this role and plays off colman very well her evil <UNK> reminds me of bette davis in of human bondage br br well acted and well directed this is one of my favorite colman <UNK>
<START> various spoilers follow br br gene kelly not georges <UNK> who is sometimes criticized for being too young and un french not leslie caron who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance not even oscar <UNK> who more often than not <UNK> the dickens out of me br br no it would definitely be gene kelly there's something about his screen persona that's too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as a <UNK> artist in paris content to put off facing the critics <UNK> <UNK> with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets that's what made him so effective in <UNK> in the rain and other movies where he played ambitious focused characters jerry <UNK> is in some ways a cousin to tommy <UNK> in <UNK> another <UNK> story with kelly miscast as an american at loose ends who falls in love with a <UNK> european place and an innocent female who <UNK> its virtues br br except that jerry isn't as likeable as even poor <UNK> tommy that's another <UNK> thing about this film jerry is sometimes a <UNK> to milo and even worse to <UNK> when he first sees the latter at a club he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him when she sits down again he pulls an even <UNK> trick to get her phone number when he calls her the next day she hangs up on him which he takes as a cue to drop in at her <UNK> and throughout all this it's obvious she wants nothing to do with him when she starts laughing at his jokes in the <UNK> shop it's about as believable as <UNK> interest in his paintings sure he's good looking and playful but why should that <UNK> her when she's got <UNK> who seems like a gentleman to boot br br admittedly it comes off so <UNK> partly because of the actress if a role like <UNK> was played by say judy garland she would shower jerry with <UNK> insults and <UNK> if she was played by <UNK> <UNK> one would admire his guts but when she's played by first <UNK> leslie caron she looks and acts like a shy vulnerable teenager and as a result jerry just seems like a creep and why did they choose these other actors though personally i'd rather they'd solved things by changing the lead when the whole story <UNK> on the romance of these two young poor <UNK> <UNK> themselves from their <UNK> <UNK> to older rich people not only is gene kelly a few years above <UNK> and <UNK> he's old enough to be <UNK> father br br in short i think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedic relief type dancer as jerry the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles e g ray macdonald in good news or bobby van in small town girl maybe not them necessarily but someone like them someone who could have chased <UNK> and made it seem <UNK> playful someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that <UNK> hole in the wall someone whose humor and <UNK> would have <UNK> better with oscar <UNK> sarcastic <UNK> it probably also would have made the ballet seem less <UNK> and it might have provided a voice that could sing gershwin better br br all this may give the impression that i don't like gene kelly i do like him he was terrific in most of his films just not this one well and a few others i don't despise <UNK> itself either it has good points like the art direction and leslie caron who despite her <UNK> is rather charming and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting georges <UNK> does a fine job and his <UNK> to paradise is my favorite number in the movie nina <UNK> is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with somebody but not jerry <UNK> i wouldn't wish that on her
<START> artistically speaking this is a beautiful movie the cinematography music and costumes are gorgeous in fact this movie is <UNK> than those directed by <UNK> <UNK> himself in this case he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death br br so as far as the writing goes the dialog was well written and the story at times was interesting however the story was also rather depressing yet <UNK> in some ways after all it's the story of a group of women who work in a <UNK> it's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in japan the women still long for a better life this reminds me a lot of the movie streets of shame though streets of <UNK> characters are a lot less likable and more one dimensional br br so overall it gets a 7 mostly due to everything but the writing it's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great <UNK>
<START> this really is an incredible film not only does it document the eternal struggle of <UNK> and <UNK> people to gain their <UNK> voice but it also shows the united states up for its <UNK> <UNK> and blatant disregard for human rights and self determination chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be <UNK> as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of <UNK> or justice these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before br br and in the cross <UNK> we see the usa once again pulling the strings and <UNK> all sense of reality it's heart breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the <UNK> of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by <UNK> american <UNK> and their seemingly <UNK> citizens the footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active <UNK> of a people and its government fighting for its future truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience these irish film makers deserve our <UNK> long live chavez br br we need to <UNK> the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are and this documentary does a great job of doing just that
<START> make no mistake maureen <UNK> is easily the most gorgeous jane ever and there will never be one more gorgeous she is visually stunning that aside it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film this is a great film it not only has the classic tarzan aura but also the feel of the continuing saga we become involved with the two white hunters who search for <UNK> one of them in love with jane the other a <UNK> <UNK> whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted however the <UNK> are depicted as individuals and at the end two even become more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such in fact the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters the finale also is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie the great lion attack has never been <UNK> and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction if i left anything out it is because i do not want to <UNK> the picture for those who haven't seen it but it is everything you could want in a movie
<START> an <UNK> of <UNK> sexual assault along with some other unpleasant <UNK> including <UNK> use of a <UNK> are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high school <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> new jersey by a mildly retarded student heather <UNK> the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the <UNK> office where ally <UNK> and eric <UNK> are put in charge br br rumors about the case spread through <UNK> <UNK> an upper middle class <UNK> where the <UNK> are <UNK> by everyone in the community one of their fathers is a police lieutenant nobody believes <UNK> our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement rape her and subject her to such sexual <UNK> the question is whether <UNK> and <UNK> will ever be able to shape a <UNK> <UNK> case that they can bring the <UNK> to trial <UNK> is not an ideal <UNK> she's desperate for love and friendship and that makes it easy for faux friends to <UNK> her into making false statements a slimy reporter says you can trust me but it turns out the reporter can't be trusted at all another student a very popular girl in school pulls a linda <UNK> on <UNK> pretending to be her <UNK> buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident and <UNK> the results as a consequence watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster at first it looks like a good case for <UNK> and <UNK> but then <UNK> the community <UNK> against the law then it looks good again but then the reporter <UNK> then that <UNK> is no sooner overcome than linda <UNK> <UNK> her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate <UNK> was lying well actually she was lying but she was lying to her <UNK> in order to please her then that's overcome but <UNK> objects to taking the stand because she doesn't want to be <UNK> as retarded eric <UNK> is fine in the part of the <UNK> i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in <UNK> <UNK> around the same time i hope he wasn't the kid i had that <UNK> with at the bar of the <UNK> club if he was i take back my compliment ally <UNK> is a strange actress and hard to <UNK> she did a marvelous self restrained job in fine art but i didn't sense any particular effort being put into this role which was rather formulaic anyway i mean neither she nor <UNK> nor anyone else could give a <UNK> performance in what's essentially a comic book story br br the producers and director had the good sense to choose heather <UNK> for the role of victim the very worst thing they could have done is cast an <UNK> lovely <UNK> blond instead <UNK> without being at all ugly looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is <UNK> by her <UNK> and make up nor have the writers turned her <UNK> and gentle she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to which is all for the good br br <UNK> character is the best drawn in the film the <UNK> are stereotypes pure evil they think themselves above the law <UNK> in on some nice girl's party in east orange trash the place during a party far worse than la <UNK> <UNK> climactic orgy and leave without explanation or <UNK> they deserve to get it in the neck and they do br br i referred to this as a comic book story and that's pretty much what it is it challenges none of our prejudices it <UNK> out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil and we don't have a <UNK> doubt about who's who what i'm waiting for not really that's just <UNK> is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy <UNK> from right thinking folk like the rest of us br br the film is based on a true story as are so many others we've all seen and even more fictional features <UNK> the accused some are good some are strictly routine okay fair enough now when do we get to see a film about the <UNK> <UNK> case in which the teen aged girl disappeared on a <UNK> for a few days then had her friends strip her tie her up and <UNK> her with dirt so she could claim she'd been <UNK> and raped by the police now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not
<START> i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen robert <UNK> script is near perfect just check out the quotes section on second thought just rent the dvd since it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing br br sally field gives a comic over the top performance like you've never seen from her anywhere else and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious robert downey jr is typically brilliant and in a very small role kathy <UNK> is a riot as the <UNK> <UNK> i was never much of a fan of <UNK> <UNK> but she's great here as the one real person surrounded by a <UNK> of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets that <UNK> you feel beneath you is <UNK> rolling over in his grave either that or he's laughing really hard br br five stars funny funny funny
<START> here's what i knew about atlantis before watching it br br it's officially disney's first animated sci fi adventure i'm not sure how accurate that is i like to <UNK> but it made me curious first time i heard it described br br the preview looked for the most part damn cool evidently it was also too <UNK> according to some critics after the fact br br it apparently did so badly that disney said screw it let's re release <UNK> kids' br br so with all that said how is the movie br br <UNK> cool br br i'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway but atlantis goes all out it's a <UNK> to all the cgi eye candy shots in beauty and the beast and <UNK> so much so that it's almost an effects <UNK> best of show the characters maybe aren't that memorable except perhaps for the <UNK> medical officer and the <UNK> a little dull but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot br br here's a controversy that bothers me the failure as in it only took in like five hundred million or something i know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that of this movie compared to the popularity of shrek and monsters inc has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation i don't think that's true how do you account for the south park movie what about final fantasy really the story and the artistry is everything not the method i don't know what disney's comeback movie will be like but i don't think they're out of the picture yet
<START> i'm never much for classic films movies like <UNK> going my way how green was my valley the godfather casablanca annie hall gone with the wind lawrence of <UNK> and citizen kane bore me however i would much rather watch any one of those films 3 <UNK> times while being tied up on a chair than watch an american in paris once in the most <UNK> <UNK> ever if i did the latter i'd probably be sleeping the entire time br br the color art direction and the music didn't interest me gershwin or non gershwin the dancing and the singing could help an <UNK> fall to sleep the dialogue doesn't match up to <UNK> in the rain basically this movie is boring the only other film that i fell asleep while watching was butch cassidy and the sundance kid but you can't blame me i only slept 5 minutes the night before br br 1 star 10 too bad we can't give <UNK>
<START> i recall seeing this movie as a kid i don't recall where i saw it i must have been around 14 years old i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again it came on the kung fu channel once but i missed it i was really <UNK> it is the best special effects kung fu movie that i've seen to date i highly recommend it and now that i've discovered where to get it i can enjoy it once more and for years to come i also have to check out this return of the <UNK> movie of which some have spoken so highly
<START> when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick i was wrong this movie sends a powerful message about judging others i was deeply moved everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to no one has come back saying it was bad busy also did a great job with her role in this film i don't know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great br br at the beginning it was a little slow but after she went to the hospital wow the movie picks up again i have no idea why this movie hasn't been spoken of in the movie world my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised more because it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half
<START> this is a real eye candy a world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is <UNK> <UNK> at their opponents who can resist that an ancient prophecy a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero sounds familiar yes we heard that song before but you will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery br br this movie is fun to watch while it lasts but after leaving the cinema you'll be longing for a little bit more story br br what is behind the 30 years circle what drove the knight crazy who built all these fabulous <UNK> <UNK> and cities and why are they falling apart and apart from that one bunch of <UNK> where are the people really this picture looks so intriguing but it's no lord of the rings
<START> henry a <UNK> paul rudd and his <UNK> fiancé kate eva longoria are looking over the last minute <UNK> for their reception it is the morning of their wedding and kate is in a frenzy giving the <UNK> an <UNK> about her demands for food presentation but horror of horrors the angel ice <UNK> ordered by kate arrives without wings in an ensuing fight with the <UNK> the heavy ice maiden falls on kate and sends her to the <UNK> now one year later <UNK> sister <UNK> for a psychic to tell the young vet that kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward yet the lovely medium ashley lake bell becomes interested in henry herself much to the <UNK> of her <UNK> partner jason <UNK> more importantly kate returns from the other side to create havoc for ashley as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on henry can anything be done to return kate into heaven for good this is an abysmal romantic comedy one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen no its not the cast as they try <UNK> to make things work longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancé and bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise <UNK> <UNK> a funny <UNK> too is totally wasted as for rudd a very gifted performer see anchorman knocked up or clueless please he tries hardest of all and in truth is the main reason to see this <UNK> his charm looks and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable but nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner absolutely nothing so if you are a <UNK> in the <UNK> fan of romantic comedy think long and hard before you <UNK> over any money for this one even were free tickets to fall into your lap be warned that this movie is a near death experience for those who adore love and laugh cinema
<START> whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke i mean this was the stupidest movie i think i have ever seen a killer snowman <UNK> a small town give me a break love it when he takes off driving the cop car more like a comedy than a horror movie if you want a laugh rent this if you truly want a horror movie stay the hell away from this one
<START> yet again early morning television proves an <UNK> <UNK> for films that i otherwise would never have been able to track down at four <UNK> in the morning i stumbled out of bed to begin recording 'the informer <UNK> ' my fourth film from prolific american director john ford and an excellent one at that set during the irish civil war in <UNK> the screenplay was adapted by dudley <UNK> from the novel of the same name by liam <UNK> though he was born in the united states and is most renowned for his <UNK> pictures both of ford's parents were irish which explains the director's decision to direct the film victor mclaglen plays gypo nolan a <UNK> but well meaning <UNK> who informs on an old friend frankie <UNK> wallace ford in order to claim the <UNK> reward for his girlfriend katie <UNK> <UNK> when frankie is killed during his attempted arrest the irish <UNK> army of which both frankie and gypo were members begins to investigate the <UNK> behind the incident every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real <UNK> br br meanwhile gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend's <UNK> death and <UNK> into a bout of heavy drinking that rivals don <UNK> in 'the lost weekend 1945 ' in its <UNK> as gypo <UNK> his <UNK> in <UNK> volumes of alcohol trapped in a vicious little circle of depression his <UNK> spending captures the attention of the investigating ira members for the one time in his life gypo finds himself surrounded by <UNK> including an amusing j m <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> him on the back and <UNK> him king gypo for his physical might however it's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money the additional <UNK> brought by <UNK> death could never buy gypo an <UNK> of friends  indeed in a bitter twist of irony the money was only made possible by the betrayal and loss of one of his only good companions a relatively simple fellow gypo could not possibly have fully considered the consequences of his actions and is eventually offered forgiveness on account of his not knowing what he was doing but his <UNK> must not go <UNK> br br criticism is occasionally <UNK> at ford's film for its allegedly <UNK> support of a terrorist <UNK> though this stance obviously depends on one's personal views i certainly don't know enough irish history to pass judgement there's no doubt that the film portrays the irish <UNK> army as <UNK> dedicated and <UNK> a proud piece of irish <UNK> if i ever saw it however the main theme of the story is that of betrayal driven by intense poverty one ordinary man betrays the confidence of his good friend and comes to deeply regret his actions the tormented gypo is played mainly for pity and victor mclaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a lifetime of unsatisfying existence culminating in one terrible decision that <UNK> him to an uneasy death 'the <UNK> was john ford's first major oscar success winning a total of four awards from six nominations including best actor for mclaglen who <UNK> the statue from the three way favourites of <UNK> on the bounty <UNK> ' best director and best screenplay for dudley <UNK> who <UNK> the award due to union <UNK>
<START> i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago then the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional if indeed they could ever <UNK> at all not any longer now the politics society and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed br br consider the following factors which were mostly absent in 1987 the year the running man came out that are present today br br concern with as richard <UNK> character damon <UNK> puts it traditional morality check br br entertainment in the form of extreme reality including pain fear and <UNK> on the part of contestants check br br cameras everywhere check br br <UNK> travel for citizens at the <UNK> of the government controlled by a <UNK> computer system complete with <UNK> <UNK> travel passes in the movie and <UNK> under the <UNK> of national security check br br an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on incestuous of government and media check br br computer generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage such as the digital <UNK> of ben <UNK> image onto the stunt double check br br <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> of the current administration check br br <UNK> economy further <UNK> the <UNK> between the wealthy and not so wealthy increasing numbers of <UNK> groups <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> of big government civil <UNK> <UNK> just under or at the surface of nearly every <UNK> public event regardless of its origin or intent check check check br br then again maybe it's just a movie based on a stephen king <UNK> but just to be safe i'm moving to switzerland
<START> october sky is a film that will steal your heart fill your mind with vivid imagery and lift your spirit the tale of homer <UNK> and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first especially when the film is set in a mining town where the future is as clear cut as the <UNK> of coal in the mine but homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps with the <UNK> of miss <UNK> a friendly teacher members of his father's staff and his friends homer attempts to make his dream a reality br br yet as in any true to life story there are many stops along the way director joe <UNK> <UNK> us into the coal mines where we witness the chilling plight of <UNK> <UNK> beneath a ceiling of rock with lit <UNK> and bent <UNK> they <UNK> alien <UNK> more than humans in the darkness the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> and the <UNK> faces were a constant reminder of the danger the <UNK> faced in their work br br <UNK> the mine <UNK> <UNK> load are the images of homer and his friend's rocket <UNK> underneath the blue bowl of sky rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the <UNK> and nothing can match the scene when homer sees <UNK> for the first time br br yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters <UNK> father is a classic hardened man but he has a soft side as well we see that he does love his son despite their many arguments the love and support of miss <UNK> is evident as well best of all the film is uncomfortable it doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow it tears at you lifts you up it keeps an air of reality which is important in a film like this br br this film can be considered a complete work at first i was disappointed that the film did not continue with <UNK> life i didn't want it to end then i realized that's what a good film does to a person if it has done its job you won't want it to end and october sky <UNK> just that
<START> although the movie takes place at an <UNK> league college it was in fact shot entirely in northern arizona mostly at northern arizona university in <UNK> in the fall of 1976 i was involved in the theater department there and most of the extras in the film are then members of the theater department br br there is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film if you know your arizona <UNK> that shows several cast members riding <UNK> from the college to a creek we <UNK> know that the campus and said creek actually <UNK> creek canyon are about 35 miles apart and while the trip there is all downhill it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road
<START> i watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 <UNK> and house m d <UNK> character is brilliant but socially inept out of choice similar to <UNK> character house but without the <UNK> wit that laurie brings to house meanwhile <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> doctor <UNK> is not developed into a more interesting character like the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and wilson <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> holland is too similar to jennifer <UNK> doctor cameron to be a co <UNK> br br someone at cbs obviously noticed the success of house m d and told his staff to get him her a similar show hoping that <UNK> would prove successful however <UNK> a show like house demands the same high level balance of wit and suspense and <UNK> and company are just not up to the challenge br br i didn't know the show was canceled until i read the comments on imdb but it doesn't come as a surprise to me
<START> de <UNK> man the fourth man 1984 is considered one of the best european <UNK> thrillers of the eighties this last work of dutch director paul verhoeven in his home country before he moved to hollywood to become a big star with movies like total recall basic instinct and starship troopers is about a <UNK> and <UNK> author <UNK> <UNK> going to the <UNK> for recovering there he meets a mysterious femme fatale <UNK> <UNK> and starts a fatal love affair with her he becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances br br de <UNK> man is much influenced by the old hollywood film <UNK> and the psycho thrillers of alfred hitchcock and orson wells it takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward the suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of italian cult director <UNK> <UNK> br br the cast is also outstanding especially <UNK> performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career the living <UNK> the fugitive if you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on tv video or dvd don't miss it
<START> i saw this movie when i was really little it is by far one of the strangest movies i have ever seen now normally i like weird movies but this was just a bit too much br br there's not much of a plot to the movie if anything it starts out like toy story where toys come to life and <UNK> ann and andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend <UNK> from there <UNK> ensues there's the greedy the <UNK> a sea monster named <UNK> and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes all of which just made the movie <UNK> also i can't help but feel that <UNK> is annoying and a bit too whiny she definitely didn't help the movie br br now even though i didn't like this movie there were a few cute parts i liked the <UNK> song even though it was a song about being lonely it had a friendly feel to it then there was sir leonard while most of the <UNK> were just plain nuts sir leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest king <UNK> <UNK> was just a little <UNK> that made dr evil look like a serious villain also there was <UNK> <UNK> song no girl's toy it was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough but honestly even these things didn't make the movie any better but remember this is just my perspective br br while i personally wouldn't recommend this movie even i have to admit it does have its charming moments see it if you're interested but only if you're in the mood for something really out of the ordinary
<START> it isn't the worst film ever made the actors aren't <UNK> and the script and director are not completely inept br br it isn't the best film ever made the actors aren't excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant br br it falls somewhere in the middle a fun somewhere an enjoyable well constructed somewhere br br no need to say don't take it seriously or so bad its good or it wasn't scary none of these comments are relevant br br cut has atmosphere it's that atmosphere which is actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally is what makes the film for me
<START> went to see this <UNK> film and i've got to say that it is one of the better films i've seen this year the intrigue is made up of 5 6 different stories all taking place the very same day in a small <UNK> town the stories come together very nicely in the end reminding perhaps a bit of the way <UNK> movies are made most of the actors performed very well which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type i especially enjoyed the acting by <UNK> <UNK> the lead actress and <UNK> <UNK> i noticed btw that imdb has got the wrong information about <UNK> her name as you might have noticed in my review is not <UNK> but <UNK>
<START> i don't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of <UNK> or not why <UNK> because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious <UNK> rip off the concept is similar editing is equally frantic and fast which is good because aside from making the movie more dynamic it <UNK> some flaws caused by low budget and other factors br br there is lot more gore less <UNK> and in the case of <UNK> machine the transformation of human being into a creature that's partially a machine sounds familiar called <UNK> very original is caused by slimy little aliens br br these slimy little <UNK> from outer space actually use human beings as <UNK> for their gladiator games that they play with each other they <UNK> the body somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other <UNK> their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another <UNK> rip it out of the corpse and eat it br br all in all the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn't expect much but at the end i actually enjoyed this film br br as i said before this is a low budget flick but it's still relatively decent don't expect much from actors they're mostly not very good but it can be <UNK> i liked the atmosphere and gore certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited although the story is not too original it possesses certain charm to me at least br br 7 out of 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the funniest movies <UNK> ever seen i <UNK> understand why this movie <UNK> get better critics it´s funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was 11 and i really fell in love with it 2 days later i got it on vhs p till today <UNK> shown it to many friends and they all liked it but nobody knew the movie before i think <UNK> the problem nearly nobody knows it so nearly nobody can like it this movie never got a real chance <UNK> sad <UNK> has really the potential of a comedy like monsters inc or <UNK> ok enough <UNK> what i really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you <UNK> get mad about it it´s worth watching prepare to laugh earth <UNK>
<START> i live in <UNK> so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me this brought it home that two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of <UNK> and <UNK> did just to document the horror that <UNK> on that day this film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings
<START> i managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of mst3k and oh boy even with the <UNK> this movie was excruciatingly bad imagine someone whose <UNK> with a camera could be out done by a monkey br br the highlights what little there were came from the special effects which were ok the acting for the most part was also ok though nothing special it was of a higher quality than other b movies i have seen in the past br br the rest of this movie is <UNK> bad the camera work often looks like they've just put the camera man on roller <UNK> and pushed him along the story if it can be called that is so full of holes it's almost funny it never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place or needs human flesh in order to survive the script is poorly written and the dialogue <UNK> on just plane stupid the climax to movie if there is one is absolutely laughable br br if you can't find the mst3k version avoid this at all costs
<START> robert stack never really got over losing a best supporting actor oscar for his role as kyle in written on the wind to anthony <UNK> 12 minute performance in lust for life stack plays the deeply disturbed alcoholic son of an oil <UNK> he has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised mitch played by rock hudson they both love the same woman lucy lauren bacall who becomes <UNK> wife <UNK> sister <UNK> dorothy malone is a drunken slut who's in love with mitch their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of douglas sirk who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films including imitation of life all that heaven allows magnificent obsession and many others br br make no mistake this is a <UNK> and stack and dorothy malone make the most of their roles malone winning a best supporting actress oscar there's one amazing scene mentioned in other comments where she wildly dances to loud music as her father <UNK> and dies on the <UNK> we're led to believe that <UNK> sleeps with everyone including the guy that <UNK> the gas because she's in love with mitch mitch wants nothing to do with her he's so in love with lucy that out of loyalty to kyle he wants to go to work in iran to avoid temptation i doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was br br hudson and bacall have the less exciting roles here <UNK> mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up <UNK> <UNK> for his entire life and bacall is <UNK> wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of <UNK> sirk focuses on the more <UNK> supporting players br br in <UNK> hands written on the wind is an effective film and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting the director had a gift for this type of movie and though he had many <UNK> he never had an equal
<START> i have a deep liking for this film despite it appearing deliberately less <UNK> than the other fred and ginger films not to mention the slightly <UNK> casting of harriet <UNK> in the lead romantic role br br once again with these films the plot is of a minor consequence astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor who happens to be a brilliant former <UNK> of course and rogers an aspiring performer in a seedy dime a dance music hall although their relationship is bright and fun to watch they are <UNK> down by an un involving main story of <UNK> and randolph scott not <UNK> in finding any chemistry between them br br although it was a last minute decision <UNK> was rather miscast in this as she doesn't have the screen presence to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and likable throughout the film may have <UNK> in promoting lucille <UNK> wise cracking <UNK> <UNK> character to a larger role as she simply <UNK> in every small scene and would have made a great helen <UNK> type side kick to rogers in this kind of bright film see <UNK> <UNK> made the following year for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses that scott's one dimensional <UNK> character eventually falls in love with <UNK> is even harder to believe than astaire being in the navy br br now onto the important part the singing and dancing nothing more can be said about let's face the music and dance other than it is brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and i often finish watching that scene with tears in my eyes however other songs in the film deserve some recognition as well i'm putting all my eggs in one basket is a lovely example of the comedic instincts of astaire and rogers and almost <UNK> fun at their reputation of <UNK> into spontaneous perfectly <UNK> dancing other highlights are i'd rather lead the band and let yourself go which show how these two talents could perform as brilliantly alone as together i nearly forgot to mention that this is one of the few if not the only time we see astaire brilliantly play on the piano it seems this man's talents were endless br br overall i actually prefer this to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> although only just as it is more <UNK> and performed so <UNK> by all involved it is hard to dislike the fun factor
<START> as i was watching this movie i was thinking ok it'll get good any moment i was wrong the real best part of this movie was when it was over a complete waste of <UNK> minutes all seriousness aside the best part was when the wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn't really even see him that good and the tail end was really kind of dumb as well there was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down the worse part is there was more talk of the wendigo then there was wendigo for the creature to be so bad you definitely couldn't tell it by this movie
<START> i have just watched the movie for the first time i wanted to watch it as i like drew barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies br br the movie is about a girl played by young and beautiful drew barrymore who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin <UNK> who <UNK> her br br the movie is quite poor and lousy both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it <UNK> up it is just something for the fans of drew barrymore
<START> i watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar <UNK> to billy elliott 2000 both films are based around a troubled father son relationship in both films the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town both sons face <UNK> by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them br br the major difference that i found between the films was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the <UNK> father very well as he went on to do in american beauty 1999 joe <UNK> surprised me with his subtle directing very different from his other directorial features such as <UNK> 1995 and jurassic park iii 2001 br br
<START> i've seen all four of the movies in this series each one <UNK> further and further from the books this is the worst one yet my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than <UNK> <UNK> joy the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters willie <UNK> henry clark <UNK> and cookie the names ages <UNK> of the children are wrong the entire story line is no where in the book br br i find it a great <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way the music is too loud the actors are not convincing they lack emotions br br if you want a good family movie this might do it is clean don't watch it though if you are hoping for a <UNK> version of the book i hope that this will be the last movie from this series but i doubt it if there are more movies made i wish michael <UNK> jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines the books are excellent and if closely followed would make excellent movies
<START> i haven't read a biography of lincoln so maybe this was an accurate portrayal br br and maybe it's because i'm used to the equally <UNK> and unrealistic <UNK> portrayals that <UNK> <UNK> lincoln as brilliant honorable and the <UNK> of our country br br but why would they make a movie representing lincoln as a <UNK> while henry fonda made an excellent lincoln his portrayal of him as an <UNK> <UNK> i'm just a simple guy seemed a little insulting br br granted that was <UNK> jr 's whole campaign to make us think he was just a regular guy so we wouldn't care that he's a rich <UNK> moron but that's a whole other story br br not only did the film show lincoln as sort of a simple almost simple minded kind of guy the film states that lincoln just sort of got into law by accident and that he wasn't even that interested in the law only with the <UNK> simplistic idea of the law being about rights <UNK> in the film he's not a very good defense attorney he <UNK> around with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses and the outcome is mostly determined by chance luck br br furthermore partly because this was <UNK> by <UNK> in reaction to some play <UNK> by <UNK> that had come out and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times the film is unfortunately religious racist and conservative br br don't waste your time on this film
<START> saying this movie is extremely hard to follow and just as frustrating to sit through is putting it very mildly also saying that the current available print is dark dreary <UNK> <UNK> edited painfully dubbed seemingly <UNK> and in almost unwatchable shape is also correct this film is in dire need of a good <UNK> from the full uncut original negative and seeing how it's reasonably atmospheric and won the director an award at the <UNK> film festival it might actually be worth the trouble then again maybe not it's just impossible to tell in its current condition what kind of movie it actually is it starts fairly interesting if you can <UNK> the completely senseless pre credits opening sequence which involves a deranged cat killing snake loving little girl named <UNK> the girls mom carla <UNK> randall who should have laid off the <UNK> a little bit <UNK> some <UNK> around in the garage and <UNK> the brat seemingly about as crazy as young <UNK> she goes to visit her estranged photographer ex boyfriend mario john <UNK> <UNK> he's on vacation from work but so desperate to get away from carla that he begs his <UNK> to set him up on an assignment any assignment she <UNK> you'll be sorry as he heads out the door well mario is assigned to photograph witches mountain somewhere in the <UNK> i believe before he gets to his destination he gets sight of a <UNK> on the beach named <UNK> patty shepard and <UNK> a few pictures of her taking off her bikini top only slightly <UNK> she claims to be a single writer the two <UNK> and then decide it would be a <UNK> idea if they went on the trip up the mountain together when they stop by her place so she can pack her <UNK> mario suddenly hears loud sinister music <UNK> claims he's just hearing things br br so the two begin their trip up the mountain taking a stop at a local <UNK> to spend the night there they encounter a weird partially deaf crazy eyed <UNK> victor israel and <UNK> claims someone was <UNK> on here through her window the next day under some <UNK> she wanders off up the mountain and is eventually located by mario who <UNK> out of his <UNK> and runs after her while he's finding out what's up someone steals their <UNK> and they're forced to walk a piece eventually finding the <UNK> <UNK> at the foot of a small ancient seeming abandoned village almost like someone was trying to intentionally lure them there well as we will see that's exactly what has happened in the village they encounter a friendly old woman named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who claims she's the only person still living there and lets them stay in her home mario takes some pictures of the abandoned city and when he develops them they are <UNK> full of people slightly <UNK> out he and <UNK> begin to leave and get stuck in <UNK> fog and have to pull over and camp out for the night the rest of the movie has to do with voodoo dolls black cats <UNK> into sexy women satanic <UNK> performed by ladies in their <UNK> and a deadly fall off a cliff and yeah <UNK> carla the estranged wife turns out to be one of the witches too it all takes place in semi darkness and to be quite honest i didn't know what the hell was going on most of the time the <UNK> open ending is just an additional slap in the face to anyone having to suffer through the rest of this senseless mess br br honestly there are just a few things that stand out to me as being really good the first is actress shepard who has that great barbara steele kind of dark mysterious beauty there's also an excellent music score credited to <UNK> garcia <UNK> and <UNK> songs which aided immensely in making this film as atmospheric as it is the location work is fairly decent but as i said the print is ugly as can be and it doesn't make a <UNK> of sense so proceed with caution on this one
<START> finally we get a tv series where we get to see the acting talent episode one was excellent the script gave us a little more than usual yeah there was still the i'm not your father i'm your father and <UNK> you cheated on me rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if like so many tv <UNK> do br br the camera work also gave us a little more than usual there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary <UNK> inside shots or hand held camera <UNK> to add an artistic edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well br br nothing was over <UNK> or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant it was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script a real opportunity thank you tony <UNK> sam miller channel ten and all cast and crew wonderful work please continue what you are doing your efforts are much appreciated and do not go <UNK>
<START> i will warn you here i chose to believe those reviewers who said that this wasn't an action film in the usual sense rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alright br br i am here to tell you that they were wrong completely wrong br br well no not completely it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick they were right about that but it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as well br br tom <UNK> wasn't too bad i suppose no worse than usual but what possessed them to cast billy zane in this was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers a way to made their film a guaranteed flop in that case it worked br br if they were actually aiming for success then why not cast somebody who can act oh and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write ah yes and a director who knows how to direct br br as someone who sat through this mess actually believing it would shortly redeem itself i can assure you it never did pity it could've been a good film
<START> having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of bourne movies i was a little reluctant to watch the bourne ultimatum br br however it was a very thrilling experience and i didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films each part of the story was easy to understand and i fell in love with the bourne ultimatum before it had reached the <UNK> i don't think i have ever watched such an <UNK> made and gripping film especially an action film since i usually shy away from action and thriller type movies this was such great news to me ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll br br matt damon was simply fantastic as his role as jason bourne i've heard a lot about his great performances in the bourne 1 2 and now this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future br br the stunts were handled with style each one was done brilliantly and i was just shocked by the <UNK> of this movie well done
<START> i love this episode of columbo maybe it's because ruth gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer <UNK> mitchell an american version of dame agatha christie she is delicious to watch as the <UNK> lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident she blames her <UNK> husband the nephew she plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her i would have loved somebody else than <UNK> hartley to play <UNK> i never really like hartley in anything personally and of course with columbo there are some laughs like when he questions <UNK> at a belly dancing class <UNK> <UNK> is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with columbo always played wonderfully by peter falk
<START> ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left but ever hopeful i stayed and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time acting was ok but the story line is so transparent and weak the script is about as lame as it could get but again <UNK> out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue
<START> while i loved this movie the trailers that <UNK> the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high br br i own the dvd so don't get me wrong i am not saying don't watch it or even buy it it's just that i still think the first scene was the best and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> of new age <UNK> and <UNK> bad film making may not open you up to borrow one of the film's favorite <UNK> but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or <UNK> based on the best selling book by james <UNK> first self published in 1993 this <UNK> of <UNK> tracks the spiritual awakening of an american history teacher matthew settle who on traveling to deepest darkest <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> either the air or something else more illegal namely what he discovers is a schlock <UNK> la populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily <UNK> perhaps because they're often accompanied by a <UNK> <UNK> and an occasional shout out from a <UNK> choir although there's a lot of talk about energy that quality is decidedly missing from the <UNK> cast whose numbers include thomas <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hector <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all of whom are now firmly <UNK> in the camp <UNK> for those who care the plot involves the military terrorists and the roman catholic church <UNK> mastroianni provided the inept direction while mr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and dan gordon wrote the hoot of a script in short easily the worst film seen in 40 years of viewing movies
<START> david lynch usually makes films that resemble <UNK> put together the wrong way they are interesting to look at and think about but they really don't <UNK> in your mind perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator br br the straight story is not a typical david lynch film not that there's anything typical about them anyway it's an odyssey through rural america a real life journey alvin straight took on a lawn <UNK> to get to his brothers house he <UNK> 300 miles from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to make <UNK> to his sick brother for past <UNK> br br at the heart of this film is sweet voiced richard farnsworth he brings alvin straight right to us in a simple and honest way the fact that the film is slow paced matches <UNK> slow journey toward realization br br along the way alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl she is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation after listening to alvin speak about family she <UNK> br br later alvin witnesses a <UNK> woman kill a deer with her car she complains that she has killed several and leaves alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night br br later <UNK> lawn <UNK> loses its <UNK> and nearly kills him a nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed they even let him call his sweet but slow daughter nicely played by sissy <UNK> whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past alvin insists on paying for the call the man even offers to drive alvin to his brothers with pleasure alvin <UNK> with thanks br br while alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the <UNK> of war and the price it took on their souls alvin even <UNK> a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him br br alvin also encounters two <UNK> brothers who've <UNK> his lawn <UNK> he talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and <UNK> costs he even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother br br the night before alvin leaves the man's yard he takes his hat off to him the man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks alvin to write to him this scene is perfect in it's simplicity it's heartfelt because it's so straight so real br br the journey continues and we can't help to get more and more involved with it we want alvin to get to his brothers we want him to make <UNK> we want to know this world is full of forgiveness br br this was richard farnsworth at his best it was his last film and his performance was amazing you can't help but to understand his pride to listen to his wisdom and to ultimately feel his pain one becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in br br if there's justice in the <UNK> then alvin straight his brother and richard farnsworth are together sitting at a bar i can picture them discussing their lives regrets hopes and <UNK> as alvin says in the film my brother and i used to look up at the stars well i know they all are with the best view in the house
<START> the first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen it was a bad version of <UNK> to the <UNK> with zero charm once accepted that bill ted are <UNK> the joke can only get <UNK> at the audience for so long before it breaks br br this is a surprise this is your only spoiler warning br br by today's standards this is more fun this was <UNK> upon release sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time we get the photographer of <UNK> <UNK> the editor of <UNK> a production designer from <UNK> early work and the sound designer of <UNK> br br the writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep since this was <UNK> by the <UNK> and public the director probably decided the style was too extreme it's not it fits the material like <UNK> becomes <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK> to be smart but we like our movies simple so we don't buy it probably since this <UNK> to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off what's so good br br nice self reference towards keanu from <UNK> to <UNK> see also arnold <UNK> br br <UNK> hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts he makes his own hatred the evil b t and the good robot <UNK> have the same <UNK> as their originals lesser copies and <UNK> of language br br the <UNK> <UNK> nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles lots of high and low angles they even use roy <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> to emphasize the point br br the choices <UNK> i don't know where this started in the genre maybe <UNK> but it's used pretty well here it even <UNK> down to the 7 games against death <UNK> and club br br film self reference even present in the game against death clue this is smarter than tarantino or brooks notice the <UNK> magazine cover at the end bill and ted the movie ironic also how death and <UNK> were villains in the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sequels br br i still have some minor <UNK> but nothing compared to the original music and film are different <UNK> so it makes no sense why many scripts <UNK> around the former particularly in the teen market <UNK> is a great comedian but in these movies he's wasted also for all the daring this effort shows even cracking gay jokes they can't kill a cat br br so despite looking like a <UNK> production this is incredibly interesting from this movie we got <UNK> and butt head we're in heaven and we just <UNK> three people br br final analysis <UNK> material
<START> alan <UNK> is a so so director without that special touch as an example there was one shot in the secret lives of <UNK> in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife <UNK> <UNK> it the camera is in the <UNK> looking through the <UNK> of the two dental <UNK> with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms you get the idea of their <UNK> and isolation but not much more the lighting the colors the body language the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon if i were directing i would have spent all day if necessary to get that shot right that's the beauty and power of film it can express so much whole lives in a matter of seconds br br the shot with the <UNK> stepping in the <UNK> of <UNK> could have been improved on the child should have shown more fascination with the <UNK> should have <UNK> and <UNK> her feet should have had her head bent down to look at the <UNK> with all her attention br br campbell didn't deliver he plays a <UNK> man true but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice gesture body movement the film relies on voice over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter ego played by denis <UNK>
<START> written on the wind was an enormously successful universal picture it could only be done by douglas sirk a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given based on a popular novel by robert wilder and an adaptation by george <UNK> it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama <UNK> a large oil fortune alcoholism incest and a mild touch of homosexuality mr sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre mainly dallas and <UNK> just to mention two br br the fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio most of the <UNK> is phony like a lot of those 1950s pictures written on the wind was shot entirely in a studio lot just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in manhattan or miami or even the lake are one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop mr sirk couldn't care less about realism as long as he could tell the story his own way br br we recently caught a screening part of a revival of mr <UNK> work where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments especially during the scenes where rock hudson who plays the good mitch wayne appears there is also something graphic in the way that both robert keith who plays the <UNK> <UNK> hadley and later on his own daughter the evil <UNK> <UNK> the oil <UNK> that <UNK> the elder man's desk a sort of <UNK> object <UNK> br br douglas sirk probably wanted his cast to give over the top performances which makes sense in the way dorothy malone portrays the <UNK> <UNK> and to a certain degree robert stack who overacts as kyle the tormented heir of the story that would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen the only one that seems normal is lauren bacall who wasn't asked to make her lucy moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught hanging out with the wrong crowd br br together with his other hollywood movies written on the wind shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen
<START> i had never heard of robert roy <UNK> before rob roy came out but the movie is definitely worth seeing playing the title character liam neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought to <UNK> <UNK> and jessica lange also does a really good job as his wife mary <UNK> cunningham tim roth is one person very likely to make your skin crawl br br all in all this comes out as good as braveheart maybe even better i laugh when i think of how hollywood released two movies almost back to back taking a <UNK> at england very good also starring john hurt eric <UNK> brian cox and jason <UNK>
<START> i can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie the <UNK> man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i've ever wasted my time on it's just so unbelievably how the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> manages to pull kenneth branagh's character around by his nose the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long the <UNK> man is probably the worst <UNK> movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie don't waste your time here
<START> this could be difficult to for some people to get into being used to hollywood production styles the directing is uninspired apparently simply a filming of the stage set up and the audio quality is bad here and there the <UNK> of people's clothes occasionally <UNK> with their voices etc br br my friends and i started watching without knowing what to expect and the first scene almost put us off it seemed very <UNK> and cheesy then we picked up on the tone of the content and really started to enjoy ourselves br br it is very funny despite some <UNK> definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog also helena bonham carter is adorable of course
<START> after having seen the movie the first question <UNK> in my mind was is this supposed to be irony or not after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series i knew this film was not meant to be ironic so the story tells us about an us american super doc saving a south american republic from evil sounds like a typical story but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous the mandatory end fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen the film might be interesting for low budget movie <UNK> as a bad example
<START> nicolas <UNK> he directed the classic supernatural thriller don t look now <UNK> t he strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on bbc television at the weekend which did tonight s screening of cold heaven no <UNK> what so ever br br you see it s impossible not to compare cold heaven with don t look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of cold heaven i thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been <UNK> instead of a dead child in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around <UNK> wearing a red <UNK> this <UNK> t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it s not explained in any great depth in fact very little is explained in cold heaven which ruins the movie br br people have mentioned the rather poor production values of cold heaven and it s impossible not to notice them if i <UNK> t no different i would have thought this was a <UNK> since it s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence <UNK> also tries to <UNK> art house <UNK> via spoken thought <UNK> but again this <UNK> t help the movie at all one can t help feeling <UNK> should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen br br cheap production values <UNK> directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie
<START> julian noble pierce brosnan is a hit man or a <UNK> of <UNK> as he prefers to be called he is also a drunk a <UNK> and in the middle of a mid life crisis on a job in mexico city he <UNK> into danny white greg kinnear an <UNK> businessman who thinks he's just nailed a recent pitch but is unsure they meet in the hotel bar late one night after they've both had a few too many <UNK> br br sounds like the set up for a by the numbers comedy thriller doesn't it but it isn't instead the <UNK> is a funny and sometimes touching character study it avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest sometimes even setting them up just to <UNK> tear them down it is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it without feeling the need to <UNK> them into needless plot <UNK> br br <UNK> hit man will inevitably be compared to his bond but this is unfair to both performances bond is a half formed idea a product of all that has gone before while julian is a fully formed character with his own motivations and flaws he has existed in his own shadowy seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human being br br when he meets danny in the hotel bar he sees his opposite a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems he <UNK> danny the hit man has become fed up with his life sees himself <UNK> ever closer to his inevitable burn out as he puts it but when danny opens up about the death of his only son julian tries to change the subject with a dirty joke he is a man who has in his own words been running from any emotion kinnear holds his own opposite <UNK> performance and <UNK> danny white with his <UNK> <UNK> charm he is the perfect foil to julian while the latter is drunken <UNK> and <UNK> danny is down to earth with just a hint of <UNK> but he too goes deeper than his established persona showing us how far the <UNK> will go when faced with financial and <UNK> ruin br br there is real chemistry between brosnan and kinnear it is most visible in the film's three key scenes the hotel bar a <UNK> during which julian tells danny what he does for a living and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination and a scene in which julian turns up at <UNK> house six months later this scene also introduces us properly to <UNK> wife bean yes bean in another example of how much the <UNK> respects its characters bean hope davis instead of <UNK> at the presence of a hired killer in her house merely asks with forced calm did you bring your gun the script isn't quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite one or two lines seem a little forced and a couple of the jokes need a little more work but in the scenes where julian and danny and later bean just talk the writing is superb the film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations other than meeting a hit man and said hit man turning up on your <UNK> it just lets them talk gently <UNK> them toward necessary plot points br br there is action but only when it reflects on the characters one notable instance is when julian <UNK> a job in <UNK> because he keeps seeing himself through his <UNK> scope the rest of the film is about the characters how they interact how they each affect one another and ultimately it is about friendship even in the most unlikely of places at one point julian tells danny that he is his only friend and he really means it
<START> i don't think i'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen i've been working on a list of my favorite war movies the longest day to hell and back bridge on the river <UNK> all black and white which all have good plots rich characters and great acting i've seen better dialog and acting in student written high school one act plays the plot however isn't a bad premise just poorly <UNK> it's kind of like a traffic accident though i couldn't seem to turn it off a movie doesn't need big money or great sets i e twelve angry men and <UNK> to be good so budget is no excuse what were they thinking
<START> i found about the movie holes by hearing from people that it wasn't typical disney that both kids and adults both got into the story folks let me tell you i wasn't disappointed holes is based on the novel by louis <UNK> and follows the adventure of stanley <UNK> a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile <UNK> camp out in the desert he befriends a boy <UNK> zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives it was a very interesting unique different and funny story i didn't know quite what to expect when i watched it it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle the boys who played the juvenile <UNK> were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr sir now that i've seen the movie i have to read the book most recommended
<START> this is by the far worst piece of <UNK> i've ever seen in my life it barely made sense it wasn't scary at all unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming sarah michelle <UNK> needs to stop with these <UNK> horror films i think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i <UNK> <UNK> when the credits rolled up br br on my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would go br br 1 the return 2 cabin fever 3 silent hill br br the reason i made silent hill 3rd is because it showed some frightening scenes but the rest was absolute <UNK> same with cabin fever made no sense but the return topped that list its worse than silent hill and cabin fever put together
<START> gary busey is the title character frank <UNK> <UNK> your standard issue reckless maverick cop who's earned his <UNK> because no matter how many bullets he takes <UNK> and counting he never stops going after the bad guys br br when a cutting edge u s tank dubbed <UNK> is driven across the border into mexico it's <UNK> by <UNK> terrorists led by general <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> colonel <UNK> henry <UNK> who's <UNK> himself with russian villains the army <UNK> involved are kept as prisoners chief among them <UNK> shepard <UNK> <UNK> who happens to be <UNK> ex girlfriend <UNK> is then <UNK> by the army for a rescue mission br br busey may not have the physical presence of say someone like <UNK> who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type but he's a blast as a self confident dude who's quick with the <UNK> <UNK> is a great female lead she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt kicking action babe <UNK> <UNK> juan <UNK> and the always welcome william smith as a russian major are <UNK> <UNK> in the classic action movie tradition the supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors l q jones r g armstrong <UNK> <UNK> lincoln <UNK> mills watson luke <UNK> danny <UNK> and cary <UNK> <UNK> br br t l <UNK> and b j <UNK> supply the script based on a story by <UNK> and veteran b director fred <UNK> ray it's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their <UNK> in their <UNK> they know their material is absurd and cheesy and just have fun throwing credibility out the window veteran action director steve <UNK> keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of <UNK> explosions and general all out mayhem br br <UNK> is good fun for the action fan who doesn't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor br br 7 10
<START> i saw this movie for 2 reasons i like gerard butler and christopher plummer unfortunately these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie i liked the idea that dracula is actually a reincarnation of <UNK> <UNK> because it does explain his disdain for all things christian but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been i see this movie more as a way for the talented gerard butler to pay his <UNK> before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary christopher plummer to remind the public me and the 5 other people who saw this film that he still exists i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself
<START> i usually don't write reviews but i can't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv <UNK> br br i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché it wasn't even funny any more the same old stories you've probably seen read a couple of times already living toys evil things from other <UNK> and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés i'd prefer e g <UNK> and silent hill over those two episodes anytime and don't even ask about the visual effects the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second awful looks like some film <UNK> project gone wrong blood or gore <UNK> nothing worth mentioning br br it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn't seen read that many scary stories yet although i'd rather recommend beyond belief now that's what i call a decent mystery tv show but for an adult horror fan this is worthless i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography especially in the second episode and some nice acting
<START> what a class bit of british cinema it's about time and a side splitting comedy to boot br br anyone searching to <UNK> a bit of freedom from their <UNK> youth this road movie will prove the ticket br br it's a mix between <UNK> and i and easy rider the movie runs at a solid pace and doesn't let you drift off for too long at times there are <UNK> moments but i think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors are portraying i was a little concerned with phil daniels character at the start but thankfully was won over half way through in what was one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie generally i found myself belly laughing through the film most likely annoying some people around me oh well br br i would thoroughly recommend it this will become a cult british comedy well worth a visit
<START> i remember stumbling upon this special while channel surfing in 1965 i had never heard of barbra before when the show was over i thought this is probably the best thing on tv i will ever see in my life <UNK> years later that has held true there is still nothing so amazing so honestly astonishing as the talent that was displayed here you can talk about all the super stars you want to this is the most <UNK> of them all br br you name it she can do it comedy pathos <UNK> seduction <UNK> barbra is truly a story <UNK> her ability to pull off anything she attempts is legendary but this special was made in the beginning and helped to create the legend that she quickly became in spite of rising so far in such a short time she has <UNK> the promise revealing more of her talents as she went along but they are all here from the very beginning you will not be disappointed in viewing this
<START> a <UNK> wrapped monster goes on a murdering <UNK> a lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition universal seems to be running out of <UNK> as well as new ideas most of the budget was probably spent on <UNK> <UNK> jr to star as <UNK> the mummy br br other players are george <UNK> wallace ford <UNK> <UNK> dick <UNK> and <UNK> knox br br how much longer can this madness continue
<START> the story of the <UNK> who acted like a great soldier saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands is told in the 1939 film gunga din based loosely on the <UNK> <UNK> poem the film is brilliantly directed by george stevens and stars cary grant douglas fairbanks jr and victor <UNK> the title role is played by sam <UNK> well known in my era as ben <UNK> boss dr <UNK> a name that became <UNK> with big out of control hair say dr <UNK> hair to anyone of my generation and they know what you're talking about br br set in india at the time of the british <UNK> three soldiers two romantic dashing figures in grant and fairbanks and <UNK> as a big <UNK> are cut ups in reality three <UNK> boys gunga din is the water <UNK> treated somewhat <UNK> <UNK> anyway by <UNK> mclaglen but cutter grant is fond of him when he catches din <UNK> <UNK> practicing being his soldier walk and <UNK> as he apes the unit during their <UNK> cutter gives him a few <UNK> br br the merry band of <UNK> is going to break up when <UNK> fairbanks <UNK> he's about to be married to a lovely young woman joan fontaine and leaving the service however when gunga din and cutter run across <UNK> a murderous cult led by a guru <UNK> <UNK> gunga din escapes to warn the unit and <UNK> insists on re <UNK> to help save cutter it's a buddy movie after all br br gunga din starts out <UNK> with slapstick and wonderful broad comedy particularly by cary grant who is quite funny both he and fairbanks are so handsome it's hard to decide which one to look at first much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting in the last part the story becomes very dramatic and <UNK> in a tense thrilling battle br br grant has the <UNK> role fairbanks is the <UNK> romantic and mclaglen as <UNK> mostly due to his treatment of gunga din is the most unlikeable character although one <UNK> his soft heart in his love for his elephant annie his <UNK> comes through toward the end of the movie particularly in the very touching tear <UNK> final scene br br always a gentle and likable actor sam <UNK> gives a beautiful performance as gunga din a simple brave man with a big smile powerful imagination and <UNK> dreams without much dialogue <UNK> conveys gunga <UNK> soul <UNK> br br this is truly the ultimate adventure film massive in scope with good acting rousing scenes a wonderful musical score and some beautiful cinematic images another one from that remarkable year 1939 highly recommended
<START> boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the <UNK> door and <UNK> pig <UNK> it has created when this show first aired almost four season back it was a humorous slap at the legal system which all actors seem to take pride in portraying it was funny <UNK> and to some extent factual the characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals the sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous julie <UNK> is and was beautiful as in other series she <UNK> but is now dragged to the lower depths of media programming of sex and violence julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this production <UNK> <UNK> is an excellent actor who has from the days of benson to this production held his own in the field of entertainment always showing the humor and <UNK> acting of the production captain kirk is funny and humorous is <UNK> <UNK> and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress james <UNK> there is no doubt in his acting ability however he should go back to his <UNK> origins such as crash as it appears he has much talent and <UNK> in that direction we ask that this series be <UNK> as it already is and its really starting to smell
<START> <UNK> reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this br br 1 they might not have read the book 2 they might enjoy gore and violence in a film 3 they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence 4 people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book 5 there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here br br the only thing i liked about this film is the song <UNK> eyes br br if <UNK> you happen to be one of those people who has read the book enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand <UNK> and violence you are sure not to like this otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this br br like in the book a rabbit called <UNK> in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come only a few <UNK> including his brother <UNK> believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live
<START> sadly it was misguided this movie <UNK> from start to finish it was hard to watch because i used to watch <UNK> explains it all every day on <UNK> i loved her then the next thing i found she did a spread in <UNK> and she was gorgeous i haven't really heard anything about her until i watched this movie on accident i couldn't believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship too bad i hope she continues to act and i would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie
<START> triumph of love is proof that not every <UNK> <UNK> author who uses cross dressing disguised <UNK> like shakespeare is worth seeing br br or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> inspired playwright of whom <UNK> says his nuanced feeling and clever <UNK> became known as <UNK> br br while mira sorvino has fun <UNK> three mixed up romances her pants role wasn't even up to <UNK> in marriage of <UNK> br br the <UNK> jerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech br br best was <UNK> shaw as the fooled <UNK> as well as the costumes br br the glimpses of audience we see and the closing curtain call to <UNK> that this is all <UNK> doesn't really help br br originally written 5 <UNK> 2002
<START> i'll keep this short as a movie like this doesn't deserve a full review br br given the setting this movie could have been something really special it could have been another 28 days later or even a blair witch project br br the first 20 or so minutes of the movie i was really excited <UNK> did a decent job with cinematography and suspense although i don't think he managed to capture true <UNK> of an empty london underground br br characters were a big let down our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap and you really don't care if she dies or not as many people have said before i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or two whether intentional of the writers or not br br the main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie but when he is revealed i was really disappointed i won't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match br br all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark br br just to highlight how lame this movie was the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain instead they run away
<START> unfortunately because of us <UNK> tendency to <UNK> subtitles this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits its subtle themes of <UNK> identity racial relations and especially how <UNK> <UNK> all parties <UNK> the obvious dramatic tensions the nostalgic memories of the <UNK> childhood and the <UNK> of her relationship with her parents' <UNK> perhaps the only real human she knows we won't even look at her mother's relationship with this elegant man there i hope i've given you enough of a hook to take it in whether you speak french or like subtitles or not i challenge you to be as brave strong and aware as la <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is enjoyable trash featuring some well directed sequences ridiculous plots and dialogue and some third rate acting br br many have described this is a uk version of 24 and one can see the similarities br br the american version shares the weak silly plots but the execution is so much <UNK> <UNK> and i suspect expensive br br some people describe weak comedy as gentle comedy br br this is gentle spy story hour the exact opposite of anything created by john le <UNK> br br give me <UNK> any day
<START> the coming <UNK> to the order make it seem like a decent horror mystery thriller but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage br br first off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects the acting was also nothing to be proud of but <UNK> ledger i think i spelled that right saved the movie in this category br br for <UNK> sake don't see this movie
<START> just get it the dvd is cheap and easy to come by the length is now standard and you've gone long enough without it when home video started there were at least three versions with parts missing everything you've read is true there is no defending it and no living without it the color is lush and wonderful to look at and the production values are pretty good for a saturday afternoon kiddie epic but no question the whole santa vs satan angle is so jaw dropping strange it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult <UNK> once home video really got <UNK> how good bad strange is it i only saw the trailer as a kid and remembered it for nearly 30 years including <UNK> over the top voice over i told my older sister and she called me a liar and could not believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where santa vs satan add to it stuff like santa asking for the virgin <UNK> <UNK> before setting off on christmas eve kids wanting to capture him and make him their slave and an international kiddie sweat shop and it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the 60's like others here i watch the thing every holiday season now my version of choice is the mystery science theatre 3000 edition but any old way you choose it the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must along with <UNK> by the way it never fails to make me laugh better i think then santa claus <UNK> the martians parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out how many parents do you know go out for <UNK> on christmas eve if you get bored just go <UNK> and play the piano <UNK> freaky boring disturbing funny childish strange hey what more can you want
<START> we open with colonel luc <UNK> van damme the original universal soldier and his <UNK> asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers they almost kill the two then oh wait it was just a field test <UNK> we come to find is now part of a government <UNK> company that designs the new level of universal soldiers why he would want to be involved in this if you know anything about the original is never explained and well beyond me br br it's after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going the united states government has cut the universal <UNK> project budget and in the process <UNK> seth the large artificial <UNK> computer that controls the universal soldiers naturally he won't be shut down without a fight so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel but that doesn't stop it from becoming stupid as hell br br for instance one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg seems you can't go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie he's big he's tough right wrong van damme doesn't seem to have a problem <UNK> the floor with him once twice three times the point here lost on me then there's the breaking of glass a <UNK> part of any action movie but someone involved must have a glass fetish you have to see the fight scenes in particular let's not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips then to put the <UNK> on top of this train wreck they have seth the computer secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black michael <UNK> white nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem potentially offensive and just downright lame he's no replacement for dolph either br br universal soldier 2 is a lousy sequel it's loud it's dumb and it doesn't care the original wasn't anything poetic but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level the sequel doesn't they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence so give credit where credit is due
<START> bill paxton stars in and directs this highly original film having watched the first time i was by how good it was the reviews i had heard were ok as a result i was expecting an average thriller at most however because of <UNK> excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching especially if you are a horror film fanatic the film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits the films strongest point is the storyline which i have to say is highly original and is like i have ever seen before well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys i give this film 9 10 and i highly recommend that everyone catches it
<START> michael <UNK> has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name including some real <UNK> such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out <UNK> however is a highlight adapted by <UNK> from the play by <UNK> it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the <UNK> channel the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a <UNK> film with the emphasis placed on the simple story in <UNK> to the gods king <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is compelled to sacrifice his daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> much to the <UNK> of queen <UNK> irene <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are both outstanding but it is the stunning <UNK> who brings the most interesting elements to the screen <UNK> the innocence of childhood with the <UNK> realization that she is the <UNK> in a political game strongly recommended for fans of international cinema
<START> the original boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick it was by no means a great film but fun in the right frame of mind the third <UNK> in this series return of the boogeyman on the other hand is simply atrocious it consists of two things firstly cheap and lifeless new footage secondly loads of recycled bits from the first movie the new material is unbelievably amateurish but not in an <UNK> inept way simply incredibly tedious this footage has clearly been knocked together quickly and without any effort it serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first and possibly second movies and boy do they milk those clips from the earlier films sometimes <UNK> sequences over and over again the only new addition to these parts is a voice over that <UNK> describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes the whole experience of watching this is truly mind numbing br br return of the boogeyman is an example of the very worst kind of exploitation flick the kind that exploits the audience in a highly cynical way i want to keep this review brief and to the point because this film deserves no more there is nothing here of value at all this is worthless
<START> bored with the normal run of the mill <UNK> films to watch this halloween that i've seen over and over again i took a chance on the sentinel hoping it could get my horror <UNK> flowing again mind you i had just come back from seeing the dark castle remake of the house on haunted hill complete and utter crap thankfully the sentinel blew me away in a <UNK> story about a model who moves into a creepy building in brooklyn <UNK> the film offered everything that i hope to find in a good movie 1 campy and <UNK> <UNK> characters <UNK> and dialogue including <UNK> turns by christopher walken jeff goldblum and especially martin <UNK> as an absent minded professor 2 horrifying terror not to give a frame away but there are scenes in this film that <UNK> me to my <UNK> 3 fantastic gore terrific make up and wacky if very uneven direction from michael winner which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat if you loved evil dead 2 dead alive and deep rising this will be your queen of favourites just to emphasize my love for this film after i watched it for the first time jaw dropped i <UNK> it and watched it again it is now one of favourites of all time do yourself a favour and check it out
<START> i first saw this film when it was <UNK> around 1988 by the bbc when i was working on <UNK> <UNK> my pal steve <UNK> recorded it on vhs and sent it to me up till this point i'd really only seen the shaw bros kung fu movies with their harsh lighting so audience could see the moves clearly so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by <UNK> scott coming out of hong kong this was also my first exposure to the movies of tsui <UNK> <UNK> apparently <UNK> <UNK> br br yet for all the <UNK> back lit <UNK> and ambitious special effects stop motion in a hong kong movie at the heart of chinese ghost story lies a simple and moving love story made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of leslie cheung what a tragic tragic waste of a life and the beauty and <UNK> of joey wong granted joey is gorgeous but it's her <UNK> hand gestures that give her character an <UNK> <UNK> that's hard to <UNK> and though joey is now almost 20 years older <UNK> which of us isn't this will always be the enduring image of that actress br br some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises but they're missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous chinese story written by <UNK> <UNK> around <UNK> that's a bit like complaining that romeo and juliet has a predictable ending and just copies west side story just wanted to get that off my chest br br for me chinese ghost story is the quintessential romantic tale it has high tragedy because we know that <UNK> sin and sin seen can never be together it's about becoming mature for none of us can mature until we've experienced great loss it's about sacrifice for sacrifice is an essential <UNK> of true love and the comedy <UNK> of wu ma don't hurt a bit either br br enjoy chinese ghost story by trying not to view it through a <UNK> of western culture and you'll get on with it just fine
<START> a very funny east meets west film influenced by the closure of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plant in the eighties and the rise and <UNK> of japanese <UNK> in the us set in western <UNK> it features great performances by michael keaton <UNK> <UNK> and george <UNK> music by blues legend <UNK> ray <UNK>
<START> as the story in my family goes my dad <UNK> <UNK> played the piano for the <UNK> band after sinatra joined the band my dad <UNK> with him for hours on end then at a point in time my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group band and that he should venture off on his own by that time sinatra had enough credits <UNK> his <UNK> to do just that <UNK> never <UNK> my dad and the rest as they say is history br br i have some pictures and records to that effect and so does <UNK> university in california br br i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say and his movies never get old thank you frank
<START> this movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies stallone ever made this is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself first blood <UNK> 2 is very similar to <UNK> <UNK> but there you have arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys this movie is a typical american anti soviet propaganda true this was the peak of the cold war but i'm sick of having <UNK> or the nazis always being shown as the enemy there are so many american movies that have this one thing in common why can't there a movie that show americans as the enemy who's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army do you really think that something like this would have really happened by the looks of it an average brain washed american viewer certainly would
<START> nothing is fantastic simple as that it's a film that shouldn't work yet does natali stays in the realm of sci fi however this film is also a comedy cypher it seemed was a big budget <UNK> affair for natali at 7 <UNK> woo <UNK> <UNK> so with nothing he <UNK> down again this is low budget independent film making at it's best simple good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as <UNK> to hollywood's usual reasons for mostly financial gain nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask no it is not anything like seinfeld basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers they live in a strange looking house beneath two <UNK> andrew is a <UNK> travel agent who is <UNK> while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with by bizarre <UNK> <UNK> however dave finds out his girlfriend <UNK> a huge amount of money from <UNK> work place <UNK> dave and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually <UNK> a girl <UNK> canadian humour people as it turns out <UNK> house is to be <UNK> as well and he can't stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the <UNK> team come calling they are desperate and can't escape and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white what has happened have dave and andrew died they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet no police no <UNK> team no angry girl <UNK> mother what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to wish or hate away as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world they are left alone the house is surrounded by nothing which is portrayed as pure white so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water they begin to tire of each other they discover they can hate away <UNK> which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say i can't reveal much but i must say <UNK> heads are quite a sight to behold br br this film is quirky funny interesting the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube david <UNK> and andrew <UNK> to lead the film they have chemistry and also work very well they have to hold 90 of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background yet it works certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and <UNK> br br natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature i prey to god he doesn't do the <UNK> <UNK> written and directed by add <UNK> the ever crap paul anderson vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad run run like the wind i hope and prey this guy doesn't take to hollywood like alex <UNK> did with the enjoyable yet <UNK> <UNK> sugar <UNK> <UNK> light i robot keep your eyes <UNK> for this guy
<START> such a masterpiece as the first of these two snowy river films was the sequel to the man from snowy river is everything that a follow up should be it does not <UNK> on the <UNK> of its predecessor <UNK> to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique <UNK> br br the man from snowy river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the snowy river country after a three year absence the film subtly tells a tale of change in the <UNK> century of australian history legend and horses the storyline demonstrates a touch of hollywood in lighter shades an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film yet this <UNK> uniquely with the a distinct sense of australian <UNK> the plot is far more vibrant than the first film and much more <UNK> with particular aspects of the previous <UNK> into the film yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film <UNK> beautiful cinematography a stunning focus of the australian high country the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce <UNK> which equals the first in every way <UNK> <UNK> has done a superb job with this film and it is highly worthy of recognition especially with regard to the quality of the australian film industry the lead cast from tom <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and a well replaced brian <UNK> carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film as far as sequels can go the man from snowy river ii is a masterpiece a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again
<START> kolchak the night stalker is a hugely entertaining tv series in which a <UNK> sarcastic forty something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural and occasionally <UNK> forces based on a very popular pair of tv movies featuring the kolchak character this series died a quick death in the mid 1970s due to low ratings but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today but will the average modern day viewer be able to dig kolchak and his weekly <UNK> with the undead br br that's actually a tough question to answer fairly <UNK> of this series tend to argue that it's formulaic and hopelessly dated on the other hand fans argue that it's cleverly written well acted and sometimes genuinely spooky and me i've got a foot in both camps i thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of kolchak on dvd recently though i can <UNK> see that the series has major flaws br br i'll address the question of kolchak being formula fiction first now i think we can all agree that most tv shows have <UNK> just about every episode of columbo unfolds according to the same pattern for example <UNK> is not necessarily a bad thing in itself in fact critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy and <UNK> seek out repetitive entertainment however the problem with kolchak is that its formula is simply too rigid it's too repetitive even by the most generous standards br br in almost every episode kolchak <UNK> a murder and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster he tries to <UNK> a story about said monster but his editor vincenzo <UNK> him always on the grounds that kolchak doesn't have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work and alas kolchak is also <UNK> by the police so in the end kolchak does some independent research on the monster figures out how to kill it and then kills it without ceremony or reward or writing a big story about it br br you can see where this ever so strict formula might get tiresome right i'm particularly <UNK> by vincenzo if <UNK> always raving about monsters and vincenzo never believes it well then why doesn't vincenzo fire kolchak or have him committed that's what any normal boss would do but the series <UNK> such realism and prefers to keep vincenzo and kolchak as comical <UNK> as a result many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable though they are also quite funny br br the very best episodes of kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula however usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist these <UNK> episodes are good enough that i think they're largely <UNK> to typical criticisms of the series some of my favorites include br br horror in the heights an episode that's noteworthy for being <UNK> inventive and socially aware <UNK> dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge though it <UNK> closely to the kolchak formula the script written by hammer studios veteran jimmy <UNK> is remarkably <UNK> and it <UNK> deeply into the <UNK> <UNK> br br the devil's platform a possible inspiration for the omen films this episode stands out to me because the villain a very young tom <UNK> <UNK> kolchak with a satanic contract full of <UNK> and in so doing reveals a lot about the <UNK> character br br <UNK> this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans but i enjoyed it because it's got a great red <UNK> and a really creepy almost <UNK> seeming monster br br though i've <UNK> out these three episodes for praise i'd say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least for my money there are only two complete <UNK> in the 20 episode run primal scream which is about monkey men running rampant in chicago and the <UNK> which features the dumbest looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment and this <UNK> is coming from a <UNK> doctor who and godzilla fan br br on balance then this is a good series a little repetitive a little cheesy perhaps but it has elements of greatness even during the weaker episodes darren <UNK> wonderful performance as the <UNK> world weary endlessly funny kolchak truly shines he carries the series effortlessly in a way that for example sarah michelle <UNK> never managed on buffy <UNK> was one great character actor and this series is worth watching for him alone
<START> i went into a video store and looked around to find some horror movies after about 30 minutes i just rushed and picked out a few i stumbled upon masters of horror which contained pro life and right to die they seemed ok same old cheesy horror crap but i was interested for some reason it said about pro life on the case about being a classic a return to form for john carpenter i loved his the thing so i thought this would be good and all that so i turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting i was very wrong it started off casual just a girl running through a forest scared of something a car stops and picks her up just so being the people she needed to see amazing they take her back to some clinic and examine her at the <UNK> all this is happening her father appears at the gates and they don't allow him in he isn't <UNK> near the area most likely from something he would of done in the past but you don't know of any of this at the moment he really does not want his daughter in this place an abortion center he is very strongly against such acts believing it's sickening and not what god would want he supports what i heard is called pro life acting against <UNK> and going to extremes to allow the babies to be born they are sick they don't like the life of an unborn being taken yet they've killed humans in the past to allow the birth justice is only a <UNK> of the mind anyway back on track after the girl is examined they find out <UNK> pregnant but far ahead than what she should be she is only a few weeks pregnant but is months ahead she keeps telling them they wont understand her and that she wants an abortion and all but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a demon from hell and that her father wants this baby but believes god wants this baby not who truly does he gets his 3 sons they arm themselves with <UNK> and <UNK> and begin to make they're way into the clinic shooting down anyone who won't co operate the head of the clinic who must of had trouble with them in the past is well prepared this time ends up killing one the fathers sons but in the end gets shot a few times wearing a bullet proof jacket the father then performs what he believes is done to the women he cuts a hole where the <UNK> would be if he we're a female and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood whilst all this is happening the girl gives birth to some demonic baby with many legs and some demon raises from beneath the earth not in the same room and starts looking for its child the father sees this later on and starts questioning why this happened he did what he was told to do and doesn't understand why it's like this the demon had killed both of his sons earlier and now goes for father whilst the girl kills the baby and the demon carries it away not in the same scene br br yeah it probably sounds pretty cool and a thrilling horror movie but it isn't the acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm the script is boring and not even creative they choose the wrong characters and don't even build on them just everything put together all the small parts don't even add up to something great a waste of time i wouldn't <UNK> this as a horror though it has elements of horror they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed it felt more like a <UNK> short movie than by john carpenter br br sorry for my lack of information and detailed review i just didn't have the time to waste to write something exciting also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect i couldn't really be bothered to research anything
<START> this movie is fun to watch if you liked dave with kevin <UNK> you will get a kick out of this think dave gone south american as <UNK> plays jack <UNK> an actor between jobs who is hand selected by the head of the island nation of <UNK> secret police to replace the drunken <UNK> of a dictator <UNK> <UNK> after he has had a heart attack and died <UNK> <UNK> along aided in his role by the ex <UNK> mistress as they attempt to <UNK> the plans of <UNK> julia jonathan winters also makes an appearance as a <UNK> american <UNK> who turns out to be cia also starring polly holiday and <UNK> <UNK> br br there are a few absurd moments such as the body of the old dictator be kept frozen for a year and the final scene where <UNK> <UNK> who has <UNK> <UNK> the bloody bullet <UNK> body of <UNK> is seen moments later all in <UNK> white with <UNK> a <UNK> on her but all in all it is a great romp
<START> sadly more downs than ups the plot was pretty decent i mean nothing out of the ordinary but it had a story unlike the other modern horror flicks the other good thing was the cast i'm not saying that the acting was good because it wasn't but every actor actress was hot and attractive br br one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so the rest was quite boring another down or you could consider it an up if you want is the excessive nudity all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the guys showed their <UNK> for a long time it's not that i'm against nudity but this was a horror movie not 'the <UNK> br br unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his <UNK> and run around naked for a few minutes or watch a girl get naked for no reason or you're a die hard fan of debbie <UNK> than this is the movie for you but if you're looking for a good horror movie stay away
<START> sequels hardly ever live up to the original this definitely proves true in this case however if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch although the camera work is lacking brian <UNK> character is annoying and the plot is <UNK> it's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it br br don't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film quite frankly it's a bit different rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project cabin by the lake this movie has a much different feel but it's still great to see stanley back in action br br i'm giving it a 6 out of 10
<START> this is one of the funniest series ever i laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor if only someone would release in america region 0 or 1 non pal please br br i know it being released in the uk but that's region 2 and pal besides let's give this series its fair shake america must know this series <UNK> is a genius i loved <UNK> <UNK> quirky goofy role in this of course i liked <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> was a treasure br br release this show in america or show it again on the <UNK> stations i need to laugh and laugh again please <UNK> us please please br br thanks for reading
<START> okay this is stupid they say their not making another nightmare film that this is the last one and what do they do they go on making another one not that the next one <UNK> was bad but why do they play us anyway this movie made no sense what so ever it was <UNK> dull the characters were highly one dimensional freddy was another joker which is very stupid for such a good series the plot is very very bad and this is even worse than part 2 and 5 i didnt get the movie its a stupid tale in 3 d pointless id say i hated this film so much i still <UNK> all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film this is so different than the <UNK> it tries and tries but this one tried the hardest and got slapped back on the face again there were <UNK> any death scenes although they were different they sucked <UNK> how can they have gone this far didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5 yet they make this its all bout the money do not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series br br i gave a nightmare on elm street six 6 3 out of 10 br br good points of movie had potential with plot br br bad points of film terrible acting lack of deaths too funny to be classified as horror very confusing
<START> if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent al pacino his performance is top notch and the story is classic 10 10 why isn't this movie in the top 250 list
<START> i don't know where to begin the cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since <UNK> scott is listed on cover boxes but does not appear in the movie at all the writing is quite bad even for college films it's obviously very low budget with one scene at the <UNK> house having extremely choppy editing br br the characters are pretty typical for college films <UNK> guy nerd suave black guy tough guys guy with mustache attractive girl small town girl etc the featured teacher is about what's you'd expect middle aged heavy set guy who gets <UNK> easily br br if you <UNK> to see a college flick stay clear from this one it's so bad it's not even funny
<START> probably the worst bollywood film i've seen br br no plot line very little character developments br br full of silly and pointless humor the whole film was chaotic and direction less there was no proper ending to the story the airport was filmed in a shopping mall br br same story <UNK> over and over again until you want to say please just move on with it even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed br br the only good thing about this movie is that there were hot <UNK> all around but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these days br br btw i'm not from an indian background br br 2 10
<START> at least the under ten year old set will stay interested <UNK> <UNK> davis and fred hugh laurie little a nice well to do couple set out to bring home from the <UNK> a new little brother for their son george <UNK> <UNK> they come home with quite the odd new sibling a sharp dressed little mouse named stuart voiced by michael j fox yes mouse stuart is happy to have found the sense of <UNK> even if it is in a super sized world that contains his new family's pet cat <UNK> voiced by nathan lane stuart <UNK> on the experience of family loyalty and overall friendship george will finally accept his tiny new brother when the <UNK> dressed stuart saves embarrassment at a model boat race br br also in the cast julia <UNK> harold <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> jones and the voices of <UNK> <UNK> bruno <UNK> and jennifer <UNK>
<START> i remember this movie from the 50s when i was in college it is one of the funniest <UNK> of american westerns that i have ever seen i'm only sorry that i have not been able to see it recently and that it is is not out on tape or dvd it is a real treat
<START> this is the first non zombie <UNK> review <UNK> done but this movie is worth doing a review for <UNK> is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b movie the <UNK> itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process jane <UNK> was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked <UNK> instead of like a cartoon <UNK> curse of the <UNK> <UNK> i enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general overall 3 6 stars and worth a watch
<START> what a delightful movie the characters were not only lively but alive <UNK> real every day life and <UNK> within a family each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends br br the story has a true to life flow that the viewer can <UNK> into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and resolve br br not an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones plenty of knowing head <UNK> and <UNK> moments to share and enjoy
<START> awful this thriller should have buried what a piece of crap terrible writing characters are less than believable horrible schlock stick some b stars in a terribly written <UNK> to try and give it a little credit but it fails miserably if i didn't have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review it starts with <UNK> and ends with <UNK> br br horrible ending retarded who writes this crap the ending of this film is so contrived weak it's as if they had no idea what to do with this story line or they just ran out of money most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie it's a good thing that these actors are on the way out because this would be a career killer good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it at least no one important like future <UNK> it could have ended a thousand different ways but as it is i feel cheated out of my precious time br br don't bother with this one you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back
<START> this thing is really <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> with weight <UNK> all floating around in the <UNK> the motion capture is a fine toy but this movie <UNK> that you really need people who knows animation to do an animated film the machine <UNK> do anything well by itself if you see it as a bizarre film <UNK> have fun finding mistakes of continuity in a 3d movie it´s funny to watch the princess dress move around like a thing with <UNK> <UNK> you need animators and 3d animators not data entries whom know 3d programs note the <UNK> like the <UNK> how they lost volume and get <UNK> the person who made the <UNK> design a very good one <UNK> for sure when he she watched them move <UNK> you <UNK> say they come to life
<START> how did this ripoff of being there ever get to be so loved people say it's proof that a decent honest man can succeed despite lack of intelligence they're wrong the movie is proof that luck is everything hope your friend <UNK> all your money in apple and not <UNK> hope your <UNK> boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks hope that you don't die of shock when you're luckily shot in the <UNK> and not in the back hope you don't get aids from your wife this movie is also politically <UNK> all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs do drugs beat their girlfriends or die young in addition the product placement in this film <UNK> and dr pepper is shameless an emotionally manipulative film that is very very empty
<START> never when i was a child did i love any movie more then this one i would love to own it i watched it every sunday they played it on the family film festival it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful
<START> i have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life a lot but this is without a doubt the worst one ever i usually like dumb movies if they are somewhat entertaining but i can't even think of one good thing about this movie i like teen witch for <UNK> sake but s i c k has horrible acting lame porn music throughout the whole thing and even the sex scenes sucked i would have to compare the <UNK> of this movie to the likes of twin dragons puppet master vs the demonic toys or even a very brady sequel although this is by far worse then any of those i beg you don't even waste your time believe me its 2 hours you'll never get back
<START> i am a big fan of stephen king i loved the running man so obviously i was very excited that someone had made a film of it and when a local network showed the film i was in heaven i was all ready for a night of fun br br the first <UNK> that something was wrong was when i noticed that someone had cast arnold <UNK> i could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> could play a more cunning part as was described in the book i still was convinced that this would be a good film however who knows maybe arnold had some hidden talents br br well he didn't i soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re written the entire story to make it about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it was a standard arnold film hero is done wrong hero <UNK> problems by <UNK> his mighty <UNK> and <UNK> everyone away and hero gets the girl br br i was stunned this is not what the book said at all i know that books can't be put on screen literally but this didn't even have ties to the book stephen king should have openly <UNK> any <UNK> with the film and he should have forbidden using the title the running man for this shameless waste of film i don't say it often but this film was bad if i weren't at home watching i'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen once again bad br br note that i used <UNK> a lot i did this because i'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and i don't want to embarrass them even further by <UNK> them here
<START> i think that new york is a big fake i mean her whole <UNK> of this show is stupid i enjoyed flavor <UNK> <UNK> more better she acts like a slut and a <UNK> put together her mother is out of this world i think she is the <UNK> daughter i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl she is nasty spoiled and a big fat fake the show is very interesting to watch how much money is she getting to do this awful show and whats up with her mother i thought her and new york did not get along but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either
<START> i thought this had the right blend of character plot futuristic stuff and special effects without going over board it will take a while to get going but the acting was good and i was intrigued by the angel who is not to hard to look at i like the attitude too certainly not like other attempts at futuristic stories
<START> hunky <UNK> <UNK> green is owen springer a young doctor who moves home to <UNK> to be near his father along the way he falls for anna a woman 20 years his senior and who happens to be the wife of his new boss richard <UNK> despite <UNK> from his new colleagues owen proceeds to get anna for himself going as far as to <UNK> anna and the cheating <UNK> marriage this is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit the actors are superb green of the student prince and touching evil <UNK> on screen as the cunning yet warm hearted owen <UNK> of <UNK> fame is lively and proves a good match to green kitchen from to play the king is the right menace as richard whose comic <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> his masterful building hatred for owen this is a perfect love triangle and despite the <UNK> and <UNK> of our three characters you come away better for knowing and watching them
<START> this film is horribly acted written directed and produced but it's so campy it's actually semi watchable that's semi watchable br br the storyline what little there is makes virtually no sense whatsoever the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds br br many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials none of them went on to anything else that i'm aware of and of course sly <UNK> even less talented brother well br br trivia it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of <UNK> <UNK> about 20 miles n east of toronto i recognized many local <UNK> <UNK> buildings i think the drive in scene was filmed at the now <UNK> <UNK> drive in just before it was torn down
<START> it's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let <UNK> keep you away from your family so imagine that your older brother is santa and then imagine how tough that must be that's the premise here br br vince vaughn plays the titular fred an <UNK> loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother santa played by paul <UNK> too much praise for simply being the <UNK> <UNK> fame hungry slightly creepy guy that fred would want to portray him as then wouldn't you know it fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to christmas and hilarity and life lessons ensue br br well that's what should happen the reality is that we get a christmas movie featuring a few good moments of <UNK> <UNK> fast talking a ridiculously out of nowhere music video moment kevin spacey playing an <UNK> out to close down <UNK> operation and he's one of the weakest baddies i have seen in some time not enough of the gorgeous elizabeth banks in a lush christmas outfit too much of john michael <UNK> in his <UNK> outfit to be fair he's a highlight though and a movie that's too swimming in <UNK> to feel like good <UNK> fare yet too <UNK> in it's latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the <UNK> of the time br br rachel <UNK> is along for the ride too as is kathy bates but it's really nothing more than a movie for vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here unfortunately there's very little else to recommend this <UNK> stinker outside of <UNK> <UNK> the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem br br david <UNK> direction is as mediocre and <UNK> as the <UNK> christmas card that you send the <UNK> you haven't seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious christmas <UNK> nope we get a burnt bland <UNK> with too much sugar on top forget this and stick the hilarious <UNK> on again if you want a great modern christmas comedy br br see this if you like the santa <UNK> 2 santa baby the santa <UNK> 3 the escape <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie today at the <UNK> film festival in israel after hearing rave reviews but i guess the critics were just sucking up to willem <UNK> and his wife the director who were present at the festival it is definitely the <UNK> movie i have ever seen with numerous pointless ridiculously long scenes of nothing besides <UNK> who was decent the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie <UNK> wife <UNK> included was ridiculously awful how they cast the part of the <UNK> at the <UNK> is beyond me this movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall the only scene that <UNK> any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the <UNK> that is this movie sorry for being so harsh but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money i appreciate good indie cinema but this movie is not worthy of <UNK> time
<START> running out of films to rent i picked up <UNK> i <UNK> through the first third of the movie wondering if the rest would be a waste to see fortunately it really <UNK> up and i loved the movie quite a bit the second half of the movie had me <UNK> and laughing the entire time thankfully although there were bits of cgi included they were not overdone or prevalent br br i would have to say though the actors all have heavy european accents so be warned if you have trouble understanding those voices or their cultural humor br br i really loved this movie and will have to order myself a copy for my own collection
<START> how many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made hopefully not too many br br raising victor vargas is a very self conscious attempt by the director peter <UNK> at <UNK> the attention of hollywood nothing wrong with that in general what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and <UNK> on every cliché in the book of supposedly edgy hollywood independent production br br it's supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no <UNK> would shake the camera on purpose br br it's edgy so let's not waste any time lighting the film br br it's hip so let's have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface br br and so on and so forth all that you are left with is a very self conscious attempt at <UNK> hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the <UNK> indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film
<START> my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times i can't imagine how it could be better this isn't the complete history of <UNK> library could hold such a <UNK> it is the best summary of that history lots of detail lots of personal stories and still keeps the overall picture in view br br <UNK> narration is excellently written and of course superbly given the interviews are from all sides except the russian because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians it is very much worth <UNK> this complete program on dvd we treasure our copy br br the <UNK> do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none <UNK> in any archive there are almost no films of <UNK> and submarine battles for instance but still the episode on this subject is very well done
<START> i have to admit i laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie but it's already moving out of my short term memory in a career that is <UNK> rather <UNK> toward <UNK> obscurity ben affleck once a promising comic character actor who became <UNK> in the hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man judging from this film the transformation doesn't seem to be taking as he continues to lack the <UNK> that would make him credible in such parts while his buddy matt damon takes on smart roles in films like <UNK> affleck appears in this type of commercial <UNK> at least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive drew <UNK> suits affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried br br directed by mike mitchell whose most famous film is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> male <UNK> and scripted by no less than four screenwriters always a bad sign the flimsy plot revolves around his character's need to rent a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the old fashioned christmas he never had the concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the <UNK> release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the <UNK> <UNK> around the holidays the real problem however is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional <UNK> affleck seems to be on <UNK> attempting desperately to be lovable but the net result is an <UNK> turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in ill conceived films fortunately he has the likes of james <UNK> and catherine o'hara playing the <UNK> the couple who decide to accept <UNK> <UNK> offer to pretend to be his parents br br gandolfini plays tom like a gruff non violent relative of tony soprano but he does what he can in the role from her classic <UNK> days to christopher <UNK> <UNK> o'hara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle and <UNK> she earns the best laughs as <UNK> wife christine whether <UNK> delivering a one liner or posing in an inch of make up for a <UNK> photo shoot in what is becoming her standard screen role christina <UNK> plays their <UNK> daughter alicia who of course becomes <UNK> love interest despite some good moments where she is enjoying the <UNK> of playing <UNK> sister in front of his <UNK> family her character seems to change in lightning flash <UNK> making it hard to see what drew would see in her the story <UNK> completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation <UNK> on top of another until plot <UNK> are tied together in short order it's <UNK> that much of the movie was improvised since there was no finished shooting script it shows but i also have to admit i stuck with it to the bitter end
<START> how strange the human mind is this center of activity <UNK> <UNK> of reality are formed and <UNK> and in which one's view of the world <UNK> on the finely tuned <UNK> of the brain this most delicate and intricate <UNK> of all things <UNK> and how much do we really know of it's inner <UNK> of it's depth or capacity what is it in the mind that allows us to <UNK> between reality and a dream or can we perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see like looking at a painting by <UNK> in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality it's a concept visited by filmmaker cameron <UNK> in his highly imaginative and consciousness <UNK> film vanilla sky ' starring tom cruise and penelope <UNK> at the age of thirty three david <UNK> cruise <UNK> a <UNK> empire left to him by his father his fifty one percent controlling interest however has made him something of a marked man as there are seven members of his board of directors and each <UNK> himself more worthy than the young mr <UNK> of the <UNK> share of the company and <UNK> the fires of <UNK> is their perception that david lacks the focus the job requires br br admittedly david likes to play still he's in control of the business and does what he sees fit whether the board he refers to them as the seven <UNK> likes it or not and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly but during a lavish birthday party in his honor one of the corporate lawyers thomas <UNK> timothy <UNK> warns david that the seven are up to something behind his back at the time however it's the last thing on david's mind he's been having a casual affair with a friend julie <UNK> cameron diaz but even that moves to the back <UNK> when he meets a woman at his party that he can't get out of his mind her name is <UNK> penelope <UNK> and after knowing her for only one night she becomes a pivotal part of his life which is about to be turned upside down as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever and he is about to learn that sometimes there is simply no going back br br director cameron <UNK> has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one far more than a movie vanilla <UNK> is a vision realized beginning with the first images that appear on screen he presents a visually stunning experience that is both <UNK> and <UNK> affecting it's a mind <UNK> mystery that will swallow you up and <UNK> you away emotionally it's a rush and it may leave you exhausted because it requires some effort to stay with it but it's worth it think <UNK> with a driving rock <UNK> roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors <UNK> by the stroke of an <UNK> brush there's darkness and light and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood <UNK> through your <UNK> and <UNK> in your brain and all played out on a landscape of virtual reality <UNK> beneath that ever <UNK> vanilla sky simply put this one's a real trip it's exciting and it's a mind <UNK> br br as to the performances here those who can't get past the mind set of tom cruise as maverick in top gun ' or his ethan hunt in mission impossible ' or those who perceive him only as a movie <UNK> rather than an actor are going to have to think again in light of his work here because as david <UNK> cruise gives the best performance of his career one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door he's made some interesting career choices the past few years with films like <UNK> and eyes wide <UNK> merely warm ups for the very real and complex character he creates here and give him credit too for taking on a role that <UNK> any sense of vanity this is cruise as you've never seen him before jerry <UNK> earned him an oscar nomination and this one should also as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers cruise is not just good in this movie he is remarkable br br penelope <UNK> turns in an outstanding if not exceptional performance as well as <UNK> the woman of david's dreams there's an <UNK> innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her <UNK> and accessible yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special something <UNK> to the part but <UNK> knows how to get the best out of his actors and he certainly did with <UNK> br br he also knew what he was doing with cameron diaz who is absolutely vibrant in the role of julie she's never looked better and fairly <UNK> on screen but make no mistake this is no window <UNK> part and diaz delivers a complete package with this character the quality of her performance can be <UNK> in fact in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time and it's the persona she <UNK> so fully with her <UNK> beauty that makes julie so unforgettable overall a terrific job by diaz br br the supporting cast includes kurt russell dr <UNK> jason lee brian johnny <UNK> peter <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> taylor ed mel thompson l e ' man jean carol woman in new york and john <UNK> silent ed about half way through this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality but rest assured by the end of vanilla <UNK> all will be revealed it's a reality <UNK> to be sure and a wild one but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying and unique experience one you have to see to believe it's the essential and absolute magic of the movies 10 10 br br

<START> <UNK> spoiler warning such as it is br br first off this is a teen slasher flick the <UNK> in a cabin genre as joe bob <UNK> <UNK> put it if you're looking for <UNK> this isn't it and wasn't going to be it i'm desperately <UNK> by stabs at its cinematography directing or acting performances br br secondly this wasn't <UNK> first horror flick it was her first screen appearance period cinema tv whatever for what it is worth neither is daphne <UNK> susan sarandon or <UNK> hepburn br br <UNK> you have to give even a lame slasher flick props sure it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre any young woman having or showing interest in sex is <UNK> on the <UNK> and the <UNK> time is now br br except this one gives the chop to the sweet <UNK> protagonist as well now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its <UNK> interesting that this was said <UNK> only film role another one hit wonder except that term gives the <UNK> too much credit br br then again this film probably has one of the highest <UNK> of one movie actors in history of the <UNK> credited actors a <UNK> thirteen never appeared in any other film three appeared in one other movie by the same producers only one other besides <UNK> has as many as six screen credits what was this the has been and never were mutual aid society br br granted i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never <UNK> being that bored in my life again but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the <UNK> with <UNK> br br 2 10
<START> oh dear as an <UNK> and a small part <UNK> a fan of anthony <UNK> work in the industry to date i am truly disappointed br br you see i am a nobody who hoped for better so my comments are as <UNK> in the <UNK> but that's the point isn't it i have no axe to <UNK> on the commercial value of a work i a full member of the great <UNK> go to see a movie to be transported to another place to yes suspend belief for a brief period but not to enter a state of total disbelief br br had this been by an unknown author and director i would guess that this <UNK> would have been <UNK> into oblivion unfortunately its not and i was left wide eyed and confused having seen some of the rave reviews given this work i am <UNK> worried br br perhaps its that i try without prejudice to view each movie on its own merits regardless of author director studio or even the <UNK> of the content br br my advice as many before me don't write and direct the same production it is <UNK> with danger movies need to be <UNK> to retain a semblance of credibility br br as they say in school reports could and can do better
<START> i stopped by <UNK> and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend now i understand that the effects will be cheesy the acting will be sub par and the sets will be suspect so i'm not expecting much but it should at least have a story stories don't cost a thing except time apparently they didn't have any time either br br zombie nation had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave <UNK> the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie it was absolutely <UNK> to watch and had nothing to offer the genre br br the running time is only <UNK> minutes but it felt like 2 hours according to my wife who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room it sounded like zombie porn which if you think about sounds kinda gross but it wasn't even that good br br the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess br br it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off i rated it a 1 out of 10 because imdb won't allow me to use <UNK>
<START> time for a rant eh i thought spirit was a great movie to watch however there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 i'm being a little bit generous with the 7 br br point 1 matt damon <UNK> me i was thinking <UNK> a <UNK> voice they got for the main character ' when i first heard him <UNK> and then i realized it is matt damon the man bugs me so very bad his performance in the <UNK> was terrible and ruined the movie for me before the movie got a chance to ruin itself but that's another story for some other time as it almost did spirit i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was thankfully br br point 2 brian adams sucks the whole score was terrible the songs were unoriginal generic and poorly executed not once did i find the music to fit and the lyrics were terrible every time one of the lame songs came on i was turned off i almost thought i'd start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super american freedom style lyrics i couldn't help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9 11 in light of the native american aspects of the film they should have gone with fitting music using right <UNK> not petty radio hit teen <UNK> 14 year old girl crap i thought i was back in junior high school i can't believe no better could have been done i refuse to had it not have been for this i'd rank the film up more with disney which knows a thing or two about originality ok don't bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking too bad it's a shame they couldn't have hired better musicians br br i liked the art and animation except for some things here and there like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body thick dark lines mainly near the end there were often times when i thought they tried too hard on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion but there were also times when the emotion ran thick anyhow many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent br br ok i'm falling asleep here so i'll sum it up before i start making less sense br br nice try on an epic film it turned out mediocre though matt damon you suck
<START> the young victoria is a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> bit of history that benefits from some fine settings solid direction by jean marc <UNK> of <UNK> julian <UNK> version of the youthful <UNK> who was to become <UNK> longest <UNK> <UNK> victoria much of the early portion of the film that part when victoria is a child whose <UNK> to the throne is <UNK> by her mother miranda richardson and sir john <UNK> mark strong seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations but once victoria emily blunt comes of age and is <UNK> by prince albert rupert friend the film <UNK> blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between <UNK> <UNK> and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the <UNK> <UNK> including her secretary lord melbourne paul <UNK> but as she <UNK> into her role as queen her eye <UNK> on the dashing german prince albert and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining <UNK> with concern for the care of her subjects much due to the sensitivity of albert the film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of queen victoria and prince <UNK> effect on the various <UNK> throughout europe it makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in emily blunt and rupert friend a solid if not <UNK> epic br br grady <UNK>
<START> <UNK> and the <UNK> wasn't exactly shakespeare but then nobody wanted it to be it was <UNK> slapstick but it did have brains it had a very smart script with <UNK> characters and a fun wrap up people came out of the theater smiling hooper provides none of this there is no reason to smile if it's supposed to be a tribute to the hollywood <UNK> it makes them look awfully lazy by providing nothing but badly choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing car jumps i've ever seen it all looks phony badly filmed almost on purpose poor sally field as the girlfriend who <UNK> her hands on the <UNK> is given her weakest role with not a single funny or smart line if you do that jump i won't be here when you get back burt reynolds keeps looking at the camera and <UNK> but the joke is on any audience who sits through hooper from
<START> i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto this film was sort of a <UNK> when i thought i wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice well i was totally blown away by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie yes i actually forgot who was even in it terrific performances from the entire cast carrie anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as <UNK> as for billy connolly i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what so ever the kids were also great definitely check this one out if you get the chance br br and by the way i got to see my first choice anyway and this was way better
<START> have to be honest and say that i haven't seen many independent films but i thought this one was very well done the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction the angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it's over always a sign of a good director
<START> this movie is god awful not one quality to this movie you would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad the effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst i've ever seen this movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably if you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch dawn of the dead or day of the dead if you want to watch a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this but way better than watch redneck zombies please avoid this movie at all costs it is unwatchable and pointless you've been warned i've got nothing else to say about this stupid movie
<START> br br back in his youth the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin but his family <UNK> it many decades later the old man has raised three children two boys and one girl and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children soon the sister is bored with brother 1 and jumps in the bed of brother 2 br br one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island but no they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world br br never do we see a <UNK> moment between any non related female and the two brothers never do we see any <UNK> moment between any non related male and the one sister all <UNK> moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister br br the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing the young emperor <UNK> would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage minded girls all over him but no he only wanted his sister if movie incest is your cup of tea then sunshine will slowly thrill you to no end
<START> this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being the cinematography is good the acting seemed solid the dialogue wasn't too stiff but then about twenty minutes in there's this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor and it just goes south from there br br on top of that the demon is about the <UNK> looking <UNK> since the godzilla looking thing in curse of the demon there's also some odd demon <UNK> who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of <UNK> run br br in the end the cinematography couldn't save this movie despite some pretty solid performances by the actors the story just doesn't go anywhere i think <UNK> would have been a better title for this
<START> i've seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness hot rod takes the cake i saw a free screening in ny the other night i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers the big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam <UNK> it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a <UNK> laugh at other than that i can only <UNK> <UNK> and dead air snl <UNK> fans may be disappointed i know i was expecting more from it but it short i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film
<START> you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of <UNK> br br the saddest thing about white men can't jump is that it had tremendous potential for several years i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film racial tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone a film about the members of this basketball culture could have been very interesting but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men can't job left something to be desired br br the movie's sequence of events is <UNK> first billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball he then returns to his home and <UNK> around with his girlfriend and the process is repeated most stories build up to a climax of some kind but the climax i saw was just another sequence in this <UNK> this case being billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball br br in order for a plot to develop some dilemma must be resolved and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well apparently the writers of white men can't jump forgot this rule as the plot can be <UNK> as billy needs to pay the bills i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies but i'm sorry this was just plain awful i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment br br despite all this white men can't jump is a successful film apparently some <UNK> sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them others i'm sure were <UNK> by the big names playing the leading roles this leaves me to wonder if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors and the basketball theme was replaced with <UNK> would anyone have bothered watching this movie i really don't think so br br i'll give this movie two stars out of ten the extra star is for the <UNK> scene which kept me awake for a few minutes thanks <UNK>

<START> china o'brien 1990 was an attempt to make <UNK> <UNK> a star in the united states this golden <UNK> production was <UNK> by veteran director robert <UNK> sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms <UNK> and richard norton if this movie was directed by corey <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight to video action flick br br china o'brien returns home to help out her dad he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help so she returns home and <UNK> order with the help of two unlikely people but will they be enough to <UNK> mister big and his evil <UNK> br br if you're a big <UNK> <UNK> fan then this movie's <UNK> for you i only enjoyed the fighting scenes everything else is rubbish why didn't raymond <UNK> shell out a few <UNK> and hired a top notch action director br br recommended
<START> the way the story is developed keeps the audience wondering what is the <UNK> dark past we get some clues during the series but enough to keep us interested in the mini series the characters are all believable and i personally felt immersed and surrounded by the story
<START> i lived during those times and i think the program caught the heart of the era i do think it should have dealt with more of the <UNK> american issue but i think it cover a lot in the program it was scary to sit and watch the <UNK> on t v hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down i thought jerry <UNK> did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war i went to school with guys who came back some had changed more than others and some not so much it bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough live through it and then make comments i thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job thank you for a trip sad and good down memory lane
<START> i've now written reviews for several of the <UNK> episodes and this is among the worst an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll if watching people things they never would in real life <UNK> you let's check out the basement then this is your show except it's not amusing or entertaining it's just annoying br br the extent of the virus is never ever showed i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only as the resulting situation is very very frightening but then things <UNK> as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home and ultimately dies at his hands the woman <UNK> north and runs into a few <UNK> situations then some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her things that make you go huh or something then she is <UNK> for warmth the end br br awful these directors are <UNK> this tripe in
<START> this is a extremely well made film the acting script and camera work are all first rate the music is good too though it is mostly early in the film when things are still relatively <UNK> there are no really <UNK> in the cast though several faces will be familiar the entire cast does an excellent job with the script br br but it is hard to watch because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented it is now <UNK> to blame the british for setting <UNK> and muslims against each other and then <UNK> <UNK> them into two countries there is some merit in this view but it's also true that no one forced <UNK> and muslims in the region to <UNK> each other as they did around the time of <UNK> it seems more likely that the british simply saw the tensions between the <UNK> and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends br br the result is that there is much cruelty and <UNK> in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen but it is never painted as a black and white case there is <UNK> and <UNK> on both sides and also the hope for change in the younger generation br br there is redemption of a sort in the end when <UNK> has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life but also truly loved her and her family which has <UNK> her then later come looking for her but by that point she has no option that is without great pain for her br br this film carries the message that both muslims and <UNK> have their grave faults and also that both can be <UNK> and caring people the reality of <UNK> makes that <UNK> all the more wrenching since there can never be real <UNK> across the india <UNK> border in that sense it is similar to mr mrs <UNK> br br in the end we were glad to have seen the film even though the resolution was heartbreaking if the uk and us could deal with their own <UNK> of racism with this kind of <UNK> they would certainly be better off
<START> jesus christ i can't believe i've wasted my time watching this movie i only watched because i have such a crush on jordan <UNK> but watching this film almost put me off her this is absolutely awful i could have been watching survivor series <UNK> over this br br the lead guy in this was so bland and generic i would love it if the great <UNK> <UNK> tiger drove <UNK> his ass through a glass window i was <UNK> every time he was saying lake and cabin i'd kick his ass br br jordan <UNK> on the other hand was absolutely wonderful a true angel but she couldn't even save this utter joke of a film sadly she couldn't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug it looked hilarious br br i also loved the bit where jordan accidentally <UNK> <UNK> on her it reminded me of a time where <UNK> br br <UNK> do watch this film because of it's awfulness
<START> another <UNK> of <UNK> genius his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of tokyo <UNK> <UNK> essentially a series of <UNK> vignettes depicting several groups of people <UNK> out a <UNK> existence in a harsh and <UNK> post war <UNK> town swinging from comedy to tragedy and back this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way mostly <UNK> into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads <UNK> emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol mixing kitchen sink realism with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience drawing tears and laughter with equal <UNK> a wonderful <UNK> experience
<START> it's hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become especially if like me you happen to like the tv show more but there's a lot to be said for the source br br oscar madison walter matthau is a top new york city <UNK> who lives in an eight room apartment by himself a <UNK> of divorce and his own <UNK> sloppy mindset enter his friend felix <UNK> jack lemmon needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his <UNK> <UNK> mindset the result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a neil simon stage play br br first <UNK> first i love that apartment poker table novelty <UNK> board <UNK> photos of baseball players empty booze and beer <UNK> even a pair of roman <UNK> it's a place where men can be boys simon and director gene <UNK> do a great job opening up the stage <UNK> single set <UNK> living room by moving the action into the <UNK> and kitchen and giving the <UNK> tension between oscar and felix more <UNK> to <UNK> off of br br <UNK> <UNK> familiar score was heard on the tv show but never so <UNK> <UNK> as it is here in several different <UNK> that make the on screen action <UNK> whenever its played real location work and night shots of manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time <UNK> the world of henry <UNK> midnight cowboy <UNK> candidate rosemary's baby etc br br are lemmon and matthau too heavy in comparison to tony randall and jack <UNK> to be fair the movie is meant to be a more serious affair dealing with the then <UNK> condition of mid life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work simon has more in mind than entering felix and oscar in a game of <UNK> or a battle of wits with howard <UNK> but i don't know br br both lemmon and matthau were terrific comedians i enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as i often do in their separate movies but i never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team here in their best regarded <UNK> they seem to be acting in two different films lemmon in a comedy drama and matthau in a farce matthau is great in the beginning charming us with his teddy bear demeanor around the poker table but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like jack <UNK> in the shining <UNK> to felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally <UNK> the delicate balance of blame br br while the ending bothers me the part many see as the most jarring the beginning works fine as i see it watching felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isn't great comedy no but it's a good way to get into a great comedy setting us up with some real life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter plus it has some great shots of the <UNK> parts of the city in the middle of the movie this scene would have been a <UNK> but it works as a way of establishing <UNK> torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see oscar and his poker friends <UNK> and <UNK> br br that's where simon's lines are so great they are the underlying strength of the film he gets the banter exactly right and real and still makes it funny i don't mind you talking felix you got things to say what's <UNK> me is i'm beginning to listen the tv show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better in fact the tv show once made a good point about assuming anything at all but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right
<START> i really can't say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasn't already been said i haven't seen the movie in about 25 years and the memory of it has never left me i have been searching for it every where i have done net <UNK> for it in the past but came up empty last night i was thinking about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but i was only about 10 or 12 when i last saw it and i wasn't even sure if i had the right movie name so i decided to do another search and i finally found this sight i was right if any one knows where i can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family could you please let me now at <UNK> <UNK> com i would really appreciate it and to anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance to it is well worth it
<START> i was really disappointed with this film the first waters movie i saw was serial mom and i loved it then i saw pecker and i loved it then i watched <UNK> and really sort of hated it the only thing i liked about that movie was divine she he had a hell of a lot of talent i was truly surprised as a whole i wouldn't recommend this film
<START> <UNK> is like your <UNK> cooking same old recipe you've tried a million times before yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new try and explain the story to people who haven't seen it before a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter <UNK> father and her growing attraction to a male rival watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés and they're right it is clichéd yet i was <UNK> by how well this film works due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue and sensitive direction that makes it <UNK> i avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but don't make the same mistake i did <UNK> worth a look
<START> <UNK> <UNK> and beautiful john <UNK> masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago when american life was even more <UNK> the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history because so many <UNK> were taking place in the late 1960s final <UNK> of the great american west the <UNK> of war in vietnam and the clash of social ideals that were <UNK> in variety br br <UNK> <UNK> is widely known as the only academy award winning film to garner an <UNK> rating but there is much more behind its fame it also <UNK> the norm as a work of art while this film from the novel by james leo <UNK> has much to say about the <UNK> of american life it <UNK> '60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all <UNK> the two main characters in fact are standard <UNK> men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to <UNK> about our world br br the initial focus of <UNK> <UNK> is on 28 year old joe buck a physically <UNK> texas native played by jon voight in the opening scenes we follow <UNK> bus trip to new york city where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents the ability to pleasure women and earn his fortune as a hustler we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably <UNK> in the sex trade <UNK> in cowboy <UNK> and <UNK> himself as <UNK> hell of a stud ' the young <UNK> <UNK> through his early tricks before <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> rizzo dustin hoffman a <UNK> con man and petty thief from the <UNK> ratso who is short thin and with a limp proves of little <UNK> help to joe they quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months joe and ratso <UNK> in a condemned manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names it is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds br br throughout the film joe <UNK> back to earlier years in texas including life with his grandmother sally ruth white who served as guardian his <UNK> relationship with <UNK> annie jennifer salt a notorious local girl and a traumatic event in which joe and annie were <UNK> by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair very much of its time <UNK> <UNK> strings together a wild array of flashbacks dream sequences and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also <UNK> their backgrounds for every moment of understanding we gain from joe and ratso more questions about their lives are generated both men are no doubt in <UNK> they have no clear sense of direction until ratso falls into the <UNK> of illness and joe finally senses a purpose for being alive this revelation pushes <UNK> <UNK> to its conclusion a rather hopeful one in a very grim story br br while joe and ratso badly need some luck the direction of john <UNK> is clearly <UNK> and uses the gritty atmosphere of <UNK> <UNK> screenplay in allowing voight and hoffman to <UNK> their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast which features sylvia miles brenda <UNK> and members of the andy <UNK> <UNK> offers itself as an essential part of the storyline the flashback sequences involving voight ruth white and jennifer salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the <UNK> of time lost br br any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film thanks to the excellent cinematography of adam <UNK> 'the boy who could fly ' <UNK> and editing by hugh robertson <UNK> the visuals of <UNK> <UNK> work with its soundtrack assembled by john barry as a cohesive unit sometimes <UNK> music videos of the past two decades the lead song everybody's talking is sung by <UNK> which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase the memorable <UNK> theme is played by jean <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> has been released in a two disc <UNK> edition by mgm <UNK> which contains expanded features and commentary also available is a 1998 dvd release used for this review which offers <UNK> widescreen and standard format with 5 1 <UNK> digital sound <UNK> three language subtitles and closed <UNK> french <UNK> a theatrical re release trailer not the <UNK> as advertised and an eight page production <UNK> both dvd <UNK> contain a <UNK> <UNK> restored version of the film showing its original brilliance well deserving of its three oscars best picture <UNK> <UNK> salt and additional nominations voight hoffman sylvia miles hugh robertson <UNK> <UNK> will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics br br <UNK> out of 4
<START> the movie is about anton <UNK> the music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop it's only fair that <UNK> have the last word about the film which at this writing you can find in the news section at the <UNK> website i'd link it here but imdb won't <UNK> it br br <UNK> are limited by what the camera captures as well as by the need to <UNK> a cohesive narrative from the somewhat random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight line with relevant <UNK> in dig fortune <UNK> on the dandy warhols capturing their rise to the status of pop idol candidates as they formed <UNK> produced pop <UNK> for mass <UNK> most notably <UNK> like you a song that made them global <UNK> thanks to a euro cell phone ad br br no such luck for brian <UNK> massacre the film captures little of what made the original <UNK> <UNK> great with the sole exception of a single montage lasting a minute or so showing <UNK> creating recording a number of brief <UNK> parts <UNK> in themselves and <UNK> the sequence with a <UNK> of the lush <UNK> sounds that had to have been in <UNK> mind and soul before they could enter the world br br three <UNK> <UNK> the film one by the filmmakers and two by the members of the bands the <UNK> track is solely former members and without <UNK> both the warhols and <UNK> <UNK> point up this montage sequence as the best bit in the film and i'd agree that given the film's focus on anton <UNK> it is the only part of the film that <UNK> proper light on his gift and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the tortured artist br br interesting thing about <UNK> is that unlike film they are recorded in real time one long take which can be more honestly <UNK> than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing br br the <UNK> do not come off well in their comments if the rock and roll world <UNK> the experience of high school life for its <UNK> as i believe it does the <UNK> are the popularity obsessed <UNK> types the ones who listen to rock because it's what their peers do while the <UNK> crew come off as the half rejected half self <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> like the <UNK> losers that are the real rock spirit <UNK> joel <UNK> who talks a lot nails the film's message for me when he says <UNK> you can't forget that anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do make a lot of great music br br the <UNK> meanwhile laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of <UNK> <UNK> all the <UNK> footage here ends at 1997 before <UNK> quit heroin <UNK> taylor <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> commitment to his vision is summed up as follows he's <UNK> and still living in his car you can <UNK> all his work at his website he was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else he's giving it all away he could be making a <UNK> you can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief br br the film's shortcomings can't be blamed on the filmmakers rather it's the difficulties of the documentary form and the loss of <UNK> by the film's subject that makes this portrait of <UNK> so <UNK> but it's likely the best we will get outside of his music br br i only rented disc one which has the feature most of the extras are on disc two not renting that as i've put in my order to buy the set
<START> don't listen to the <UNK> critics who are probably bitter <UNK> still sore from the <UNK> silverman <UNK> gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago the sarah silverman is wonderfully bizarre surreal immature ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line up if silverman tones down the juvenile <UNK> jokes and <UNK> the darker <UNK> <UNK> the show is so far just <UNK> at we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled strangers with candy but just from watching the pilot its just solid not outstanding offbeat dark comedy musical but with huge potential br br silverman has created a hilarious child woman of a character a <UNK> younger jewish american princess version of the late great <UNK> blank and the show features one of the most unconventional non stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes <UNK> the pilot so i can't wait to see how this show unfolds
<START> <UNK> is a bad movie about a bad cop penn with a bad attitude and a bad <UNK> who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his <UNK> in fast <UNK> <UNK> while we're waiting for the <UNK> to dry and the film to figure out what it's about we're <UNK> <UNK> back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the <UNK> thing a boring junk flick overall <UNK> suffers from lack of a story a clumsy execution and that most <UNK> of <UNK> faults no reason to care a time killer for the <UNK> couch <UNK> at best d
<START> i really wish that when making a comedy the people actually tried to make it funny this is a film that you can sit through but nothing is special about it after watching it you will say that it was alright it was not boring to watch but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o k story this movie wanted to be <UNK> but instead it failed br br i gave it a 1 out of 10
<START> even 15 years after the end of the vietnam war <UNK> came not too late or was even superfluous it's one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war the time after different from movies like taxi driver or rambo which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the vietnam vets their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war the problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship <UNK> might be the <UNK> vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and <UNK> justified moreover it can make us believe that the war has not finished yet at least for some of us br br the three main characters are amazing de niro has done one of his best jobs but ed harris is the star of this movie possibly this was his best performance ever
<START> just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about <UNK> couldn't go anywhere we are given a treat a moving and intelligent drama <UNK> by strong and charismatic performances by emily blunt a marvel in the leading role paul <UNK> rupert friend miranda richardson and mark strong as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of <UNK> most powerful <UNK> the young victoria <UNK> the <UNK> transition of the young woman into power br br emily plays the queen with a good combination of raw strength and innocence someone who <UNK> the complexity of the task at hand but who possesses enough confidence to move forward she is able to portray victoria as an <UNK> young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand br br victoria must <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> on her way to the crown and even when she takes command of her new position she discovers the road to self <UNK> will depend on making some very important decisions and of course the right support luckily for victoria there is albert a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate there is amazing chemistry between the two performers and there's little doubt what the outcome will be but there is the figure of <UNK> prime minister a man who provides victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her br br miranda richardson and mark strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and <UNK> a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by blunt an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances in here she is given the <UNK> role of her career a real life historical figure who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time she shows the <UNK> of the strength and character the <UNK> might have needed in her later years she also has a <UNK> and innocence that became the foundation of her <UNK> work and future <UNK> in social changes br br the young victoria is not a royal epic portrayal of <UNK> <UNK> class it is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them in the end the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction in here there is a message that good writing and good <UNK> can take us very far and there is of course a good old fashioned love story
<START> the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between br br rob stewart is a wonderful actor i don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob it's only by five years br br rob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel i'm sure you remember <UNK> heat aka <UNK> bullets and <UNK> jane br br he also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini series br br they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at
<START> neatly <UNK> between the stranger a small film noir picture that proved welles can do a <UNK> genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties and <UNK> a no budget shakespeare adaptation shot in old western <UNK> in 23 days comes the lady from <UNK> a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of <UNK> <UNK> that covers the magnificent <UNK> mr <UNK> and any other film the director didn't manage to save from the <UNK> of studio bosses br br six years after the <UNK> <UNK> with the post war <UNK> of the film noir in full swing welles always ahead of his time a true <UNK> director of tremendous artistic integrity <UNK> a <UNK> world of shadows that is already darker more sinister paranoid and <UNK> than anything his <UNK> were doing at the time it's no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor and it was once again europe that <UNK> it as another welles classic br br certain set pieces stand out the <UNK> scene with its <UNK> light and ominous shadows and of course the <UNK> hall of mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of <UNK> <UNK> as any in citizen kane or the trial the only faults i find with the movie is welles' ill advised irish accent and perhaps some of the <UNK> editing in the first act the story however <UNK> in a <UNK> mesmerizing manner which the cuts only serve to <UNK> i believe the heavily chopped versions of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a surreal quality for that matter br br welles would <UNK> himself in europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another <UNK> classic the monumental touch of evil perhaps the <UNK> jewel of the film noir that was already in its <UNK> days by that time <UNK> was not the box office success a star vehicle for hollywood's premiere star of the time rita hayworth ought to have been and welles marriage with hayworth ended before the movie was even released sixty years later and one hour of footage less <UNK> is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover surely that must count for something
<START> although i'm grateful this obscure gem of 70's italian exploitation cinema features in the recently released <UNK> experience box set and although it's also available on disc under the misleading and stupid alternate title escape from death row i honestly think it deserves a proper and <UNK> dvd edition completely in its originally spoken languages with <UNK> <UNK> the dubbing is truly horrible restored picture quality and a <UNK> of special bonus features heck i don't even need the restored picture quality and bonus features if only we could watch the film in its original language mean frank and crazy tony is a <UNK> fast paced mafia crime flick with a lot of violence comedy which admittedly doesn't always work feminine beauty and two witty main characters tony lo <UNK> is terrific as the small thug pretending to be the city's biggest don when the real crime lord frankie <UNK> lee van <UNK> arrives in town he sees an opportunity to climb up the ladder by offering his services frankie initially ignores the little crook but they do eventually form an unlikely team when <UNK> entire criminal empire turns against him and a new french criminal mastermind even <UNK> <UNK> innocent brother tony helps frankie to escape from prison and together they head for <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> revenge the script of this sadly neglected crime gem <UNK> <UNK> gritty action suspense with light headed bits of comedy like the grotesque car chase through the narrow french mountain roads for example the build up towards the typical mafia execution sequences guided by an excellent <UNK> <UNK> score are extremely tense and the actual killings are sadistic and <UNK> which is probably why the film is considered to be somewhat of a <UNK> classic the film lacks a strong female lead as the lovely and amazingly <UNK> beauty <UNK> <UNK> sadly just appears in a couple of scenes and then still in the background on of the men behind the camera responsible for the superb cinematography was no less then joe <UNK> great film highly recommended to fans of italian exploitation and i hope to watch it again soon in its original version
<START> br br in 1970 after a five year absence kurosawa made what would be his first film in color <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a film that centers around many <UNK> stories that go on in a small tokyo <UNK> br br the title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he <UNK> he is operating a train we slowly get to know more of the people in the small community the two <UNK> who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have the old man who is the center of the town who helps out a <UNK> that tries to rob him the very poor father and son that cannot ever afford a house so they imagine one up of their own by the end of the film the stories all come full circle some turn out happy others sad br br since this was <UNK> first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows maybe too much this movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get into it but don't get me wrong <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> may not be <UNK> best but coming from the greatest director of all time it's much better than 99 of today's films
<START> i got mirror mirror mainly because <UNK> de <UNK> was in it i thought she was great in american gothic but sadly she didn't have a very big role in this film it starts off ok and the pace moves along nicely but by the end it starts getting a bit tedious and dull that's not to say that this is a boring film but it's just very average and nothing spectacular i didn't like the <UNK> side of it and there were no decent gore scenes plus the <UNK> story was very confusing and the ending doesn't make much sense at all i did however like the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she got revenge on her <UNK> br br i wouldn't particularly recommend mirror mirror to horror fans it's nothing to wet yourself over
<START> jazz <UNK> will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing it's like watching a no <UNK> music video today br br the jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of marie <UNK> who sings a classic version of on the sunny side of the street i had never heard her sing before <UNK> sounds remarkably like <UNK> <UNK> that's a compliment folks br br their <UNK> work is tops as well with the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes this film is to be watched and <UNK> no great production values just a lot of good music
<START> they screwed up this story in the end <UNK> is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their <UNK> from hill house and a bunch of nonsense like that they added heads getting chopped <UNK> cutting peoples faces and the ceiling turning into a giant hand what the hell is that about i own and love the original movie i read the book and i love it the reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost there is no gore there is no ceiling hand it is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person they cannot kill us they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head no they can only drive us mad taking away all our senses of security <UNK> was a selfish woman she only wanted good things for herself yes she cared a little for the others but not too much david self and jan de <UNK> have taken a crap on this great story i hate this damn remake
<START> i first saw this mini series a number of years ago on british television and was immediately captivated by the story this rather surprised me as i am not a great fan of either <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> i consider the heroine of the former to be a self righteous bore and the latter piece of work as overblown <UNK> br br 'the tenant of <UNK> <UNK> like the aforementioned works is also somewhat depressing in parts however the darker parts of the film were <UNK> by the excitement of <UNK> escape the <UNK> wild and beautiful landscape of <UNK> and the sexual <UNK> of toby <UNK> br br this film successfully portrays the <UNK> <UNK> lifestyle of all women of the time at best they suffered from a form of minor domestic <UNK> as portrayed by the treatment of the <UNK> in the <UNK> household at the other end of the scale there is the unfortunate helen who is married to a wealthy man of high estate but is exposed to brutality and <UNK> <UNK> with long periods of neglect she runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom but as a women of mystery living alone in a rural community she inevitably becomes the subject of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br tara fitzgerald is excellent as the long suffering helen <UNK> not only incredibly beautiful in spite of that terribly <UNK> <UNK> with the most amazing <UNK> she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film tara is <UNK> and <UNK> while at the same time allowing us to see that helen is still dangerously vulnerable rupert graves is the <UNK> yet curiously attractive arthur <UNK> after seeing him i could never imagine another actor playing that part pam <UNK> deserves special mention for her role as <UNK> indulgent mother as does the actress who played his sister rose and simon carter who is the <UNK> <UNK> with a taste for the good things in life finally i could watch this film for toby <UNK> alone he is so good looking rugged sexy sensitive but not in a <UNK> sentimental way i am not even sure if he is a good actor as my <UNK> prevent me from judging him <UNK> br br if there is a fault with the film it is the use of flashbacks which i felt both <UNK> with the flow of the story and made it slightly confusing other people who have watched this film with me also had problems with this and i found i had to explain to them that certain scenes were in fact <UNK> br br i am extremely grateful for the people responsible for making this film not only did i <UNK> the video a rare <UNK> but it led me to buy anne <UNK> superb novel naturally this was better than the film but only by a narrow <UNK> i recommend that anyone interested should watch the film and then read the book in that order br br
<START> those who love <UNK> as i did in her late night movie <UNK> duties will love this movie she is just plain cool her car is great and she is a bit of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she is so innocent and naive at times and sexy all of the time plus more than a touch of mae west br br the sets are well done as well and the comic cast is great with edie <UNK> at her usual best plus sally <UNK> as patty is hilarious any time i have to <UNK> something for a <UNK> i will think of how elvira <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie is one to be watched again and again just for the fun of it now i have to get the sequel to it <UNK> haunted hills and see if it lives up to this one
<START> when i think of return of the jedi i think epic yeah ewoks were in there so what they're an interesting add to the movie not to mention they are similar to the <UNK> who were also able to take down a <UNK> advanced army with primitive acts jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies emperor <UNK> portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian <UNK> was one the best parts of the movie <UNK> is so evil and vicious vader looks like mr rogers compared to him speaking of darth vader what an amazing end to such an iconic character vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the <UNK> came out his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you the best part was of course the special effects it's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics the scenes at <UNK> palace leia looks amazing in that metal bikini and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at in all <UNK> deep plot and emotional moments primarily between luke vader and <UNK> and when luke reveals the truth to leia and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved <UNK> in cinema history
<START> come on let's get real the knights of christ <UNK> <UNK> or the knights <UNK> as they are more <UNK> called did not even exist until the early <UNK> century the story is so laughable that it's pathetic dolph lundgren just looked positively bored and besides if you wanted to have a real life <UNK> why not just use the knights of christ who are still in existence in <UNK> at least they should have taken history into account the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the <UNK> looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces the acting was bad the storyline appalling the action horrible and the props were okay
<START> br br according to reviewers the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year old college kids about to enter <UNK> school jolly joke br br 1955 the <UNK> keyboard was not invented yet but there it is on the <UNK> the ford <UNK> car was not invented yet but there it is playing <UNK> music the <UNK> appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's the <UNK> car at best is from the mid 1960's br br 20 year old college kids josh <UNK> had seen <UNK> <UNK> when this made for tv movie was produced br br the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tv's
<START> the movie <UNK> is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film it has all the <UNK> of a horror film but this it is not <UNK> is a film about <UNK> of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong br br in <UNK> a middle aged father bill paxton and his two sons claim to be doing the work of god it turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called god's hands we watch the father kill the demons in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work god and that what they are doing is right he claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific <UNK> to eliminate the demons living here on earth god has given him a list of names and in return for his services he and his sons will be given protection which basically means the police will never be able to capture them we see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner but what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons particularly the oldest son adam adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being that is until his father and a week in the <UNK> changes all of that he knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother <UNK> <UNK> the other half of this puzzle takes everything in as if it were his own religion he seems trapped in his father's world of god and demons i suppose this is because he's so young and easily <UNK> but everything that happens to these three is rather convincing in fact too convincing br br the events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid <UNK> that is being experienced by the three main characters i say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see god dad first sees the murders as his mission his mission eventually <UNK> him and quickly turns into an obsession with <UNK> demons in fact his <UNK> is the primary one his orders and the list of names he receives are all a part of this <UNK> watch the scene where dad finds the <UNK> in a <UNK> to figure out where i am coming from <UNK> the younger son is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction since he is so young it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap adam on the other is very skeptical towards his father's actions br br spoilers br br in a way the <UNK> ends when dad is killed towards the end of the movie i will not say how or under what circumstances but i will say that it is not pleasant after his death it fast <UNK> to the present day the story is being told through flashbacks as seen through the eyes of the oldest son adam in <UNK> it is <UNK> that is telling the story not adam as originally believed the story is being told the way he perceived it through his actions and his brother's actions <UNK> has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by <UNK> the fbi agent into his trap br br since religion is a major theme in this movie the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be <UNK> by those that do not have a full understanding of it before dad discovered his <UNK> mission he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being his sons <UNK> and adam often sang innocent little children's church <UNK> but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant after the revelation of <UNK> <UNK> mission they both took off in separate directions adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while <UNK> was gradually sucked into his father's madness br br a very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you do not watch it alone
<START> yeah sure it's cheesy it's not zombie but it's not that bad either it has <UNK> ring which is a huge bonus and it's entertaining i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience as he was never completely satisfied with it it is well worth a search out especially for genre and fulci fans it is a film that is far too often <UNK> out of hand
<START> the traditional western is <UNK> with wide open spaces <UNK> morality inevitable <UNK> the optimistic faith in a hero's ability to shape his own destiny to escape his past these qualities reflect directly the american sense of self the self <UNK> dream the pushing of boundaries and <UNK> which is why the genre is still <UNK> to by <UNK> politicians with some noble exceptions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the western was <UNK> free of <UNK> or real anxiety anthony mann changed all that forever and this first <UNK> into the genre is one of the most violent vivid complex not to say exciting westerns ever made br br the traditional western depends on a hero who <UNK> rugged <UNK> whatever <UNK> he may have had in the past a <UNK> of order and right who <UNK> the film <UNK> its obstacles <UNK> harmony in effect and an obvious villain who often ironically drives the plot forces the hero into certain actions the difference between the two is often <UNK> as <UNK> simple as the wearing of white or black hats br br <UNK> background was in film noir a genre <UNK> to wide open spaces and optimism noir was <UNK> charged focusing on the <UNK> of an unstable protagonist where morality is <UNK> the hero is as often the villain trapped in an interior <UNK> of his own making a passive victim to destiny noir is about <UNK> not progress the <UNK> and denying of <UNK> and signs of representation not the creation and <UNK> of them br br winchester 73 is <UNK> with noir anxiety noir is often considered a psychological genre <UNK> the <UNK> of its <UNK> head 73 does this too and is all the more disturbing in that that protagonist is lovely <UNK> jimmy stewart <UNK> here his great run of difficult films with mann and hitchcock in many ways good natured and sweet representing right and trying to <UNK> <UNK> to the natural order he is also a near lunatic who will stop at nothing to achieve murderous revenge whose relentless quest mirrors ethan <UNK> in the <UNK> in its <UNK> <UNK> whose human instincts are <UNK> by this quest and whose bursts of violence are genuinely terrifying to witness br br as in noir his anxiety has a psychological base unlike most <UNK> heroes who have <UNK> <UNK> killed their fathers <UNK> father was killed before he could complete the process his chasing his brother is less moral revenge than an <UNK> protest against <UNK> growth the climactic shoot out is not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> back into <UNK> society like he's just witnessed some of the world's most ghastly horrors br br what is most unsettling about the film is that it's not really about a hero or a villain at all but an <UNK> piece of <UNK> that drives the action 73 opens with the gun of the title <UNK> on display behind a glass window while its <UNK> are trapped <UNK> <UNK> framed <UNK> it outside throughout the film human power is reduced to the most <UNK> of <UNK> names change lin and dutch <UNK> shooting each other because they've no guns <UNK> lose their moral

a coward when he <UNK> his <UNK> to the indians the gun <UNK> its <UNK> power <UNK> br br it's not the revenge plot which drives the film but the story of the gun this <UNK> the film out of conventional expectations and creates an eerie <UNK> modern feel we become so caught up in the revenge plot that when we follow with the gun another plot entirely we feel slightly <UNK> br br this emphasis on the gun symbol of potent <UNK> actually allows for a critique of that <UNK> revealing pointless elaborate <UNK> at the expense of society and order <UNK> <UNK> greed murderous indian <UNK> who <UNK> both <UNK> and enemy <UNK> psychotic killers before returning to its <UNK> owner a broken hero thoroughly <UNK> who has become as murderous as the murderer he seeks the gun is never <UNK> with the name of its owner not only because there is no fixed owner but because there is no fixed <UNK> an insight <UNK> to the traditional western br br 73 brilliantly <UNK> western <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dodge city the <UNK> the civil war the wide open west only to <UNK> them <UNK> has an <UNK> reputation that is all name but never <UNK> dodge city is no <UNK> against <UNK> than anywhere else the <UNK> is inept <UNK> has just lost little big horn and the bitter <UNK> of the war is shown to be irrelevant the myth of the open west is a site for a very closed <UNK> <UNK> plot which traps its characters refuses to allow them shape their destiny but allowing it to shape them br br the old john ford <UNK> of riders on a vast mountain is <UNK> but <UNK> here not progress but <UNK> and <UNK> but for all its <UNK> the film is also <UNK> vivid in a way few westerns ever achieve <UNK> <UNK> technique <UNK> his camera in crucial positions <UNK> revealing distance with intense examination

<START> this movie is bad i don't just mean <UNK> as in oh the script was bad or the acting in that scene was bad i mean bad as in someone should be held criminally <UNK> for <UNK> this <UNK> pile of steaming <UNK> onto an unsuspecting public i won't even <UNK> it with an explanation of the plot if i can refer to it as that i can think of only one other occasion in some 40 odd years of movie watching that i have found need to <UNK> my <UNK> on a movie i mean after all no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie do they well yes apparently they do and the guilty man is writer director <UNK> <UNK> but the worst of it is that blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers be advised leave this crap where it belongs stuck on the shelf gathering dust
<START> i had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the <UNK> death march as my conscious was beaten into <UNK> by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a <UNK> the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end the lead by casper van <UNK> made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in on deadly ground as his line reading was so wooden that woody <UNK> was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my <UNK> was more <UNK> when asking for popcorn to eat the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my <UNK> grade 3 play <UNK> which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from <UNK> of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were <UNK> friendly by <UNK> cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from <UNK> what robert wagner tom <UNK> and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at <UNK> against their agents for <UNK> for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to <UNK> with prolonged viewing on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes <UNK> for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the <UNK> back for their poor performances in such movies beware and be safe avoid at all costs
<START> that's incredible <UNK> who he was also a <UNK> was one of the <UNK> director of all the world this movie stole the original title of <UNK> duck you sucker but tell the boring story of a <UNK> agent against the killer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the improbable gordon mitchell a <UNK> all is poor and crazy in this <UNK> filmed into the dear landscapes of <UNK> the story is bad and crazy at the same time <UNK> was not able and <UNK> at the same time into the story happened some kind of crazy illogical things like the discussion into the <UNK> house and the <UNK> appearance of butch cassidy yes really butch cassidy who is portrayed like an idiot <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> absurd <UNK> <UNK> plot bad acting and a <UNK> appearance by one of the most rewarded anchorman in the story of italian television <UNK> <UNK> ah of course <UNK> kinski yes is great and terrible but i'm sure he was in it only for money an for playing with iron horses 2 of 10 but don't miss it
<START> q e d was a brilliant tv series and it truly was one of the very few worth <UNK> for i suspect that in this era of <UNK> and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982 i am eagerly awaiting its <UNK> on dvd br br while it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like the wild wild west the <UNK> and the adventures of <UNK> county jr all of which i am a huge fan of q e d had a much more intellectual quality to it it did not suffer for that however the dialog was witty and the action was high the show ran in the uk as mastermind and it did have something of the bbc feel to it but with better production values than bbc typically had in that era br br i was a <UNK> year old <UNK> when this series ran initially and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television i remember my dear mother however calling me to remind me that q e d was on and we would sit on the phone and watch it together wonderful memories br br truly q e d is a sad loss and if it could be done with the same quality and values today i would love to see it make a return
<START> looking for <UNK> <UNK> at my local video store i found this 1985 version that looked interesting wow it was amazing very much a ken russell kind of film quirky stylized very artistic and of course different <UNK> was presented not so much as evil <UNK> but as a wacky <UNK> emperor who would rather have had a circus career he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire it wasn't much fun and fun is what he <UNK> for <UNK> maria <UNK> had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth yes <UNK> <UNK> the christians with a vengeance one of many who did so at one point one of his henchmen <UNK> no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves he got that right
<START> in carmen <UNK> once again seeks to establish a dynamic <UNK> between reality and fiction between the actual passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance portions of the opera carmen and the scripted passions from the story of the fictional carmen the famous fatal mix of a free spirit read disregard for <UNK> and her ability to drive men mad with desire <UNK> used this same vehicle fiction reality in an earlier black and white film <UNK> de <UNK> blood wedding but whereas the tensions between the dancers <UNK> blood wedding showed to advantage how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed through directing their emotions into their roles in carmen the parallel between the petty <UNK> <UNK> of the dancers of the <UNK> during <UNK> and the spirit <UNK> to do with the <UNK> carmen never comes even close to being believable it remains a gadget and for that reason a <UNK> distraction one really needs to see blood wedding next to carmen to appreciate the comparison however it hardly matters the melodrama <UNK> tries to <UNK> upon his carmen because the flamenco dancing and guitar music of the <UNK> which are 95 of the film by some of the best known flamenco dancers and musicians more than <UNK> the price of entry a flawed film and a wonder perfect for doing a <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perhaps
<START> this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites the voices for the animals are wonderful sally field and michael j fox are both brilliant as the sassy <UNK> and the young inexperienced <UNK> but the real standout is don <UNK> as the old faithful golden <UNK> this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults humorous and suspenseful and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry happy tears
<START> i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel jane eyre both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane i've seen other versions but none compare to this one the best one for me i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13 at that time i was a <UNK> and i had just read charlotte <UNK> novel i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes i'd like to see it again because it's so good
<START> after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie i knew what was supposed to happen i had high expectations of the movie because of the rating the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie i have a couple main points for not liking this movie br br spoilers br br 1 the casting jack nicholson barely fits into jack <UNK> character also i would have never picked <UNK> duvall for wendy i <UNK> wendy much differently i can see why they picked jack nicholson though the grin the <UNK> <UNK> but he's not supposed to really look <UNK> he's supposed to look normal and he turns evil also they make one of the worst movie couples danny was alright he needed more life though he acted way to <UNK> br br 2 the screenplay they cut out so many things that were in the book and added things some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted changed or handled wrongly some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing the <UNK> animals the <UNK> <UNK> the elevator were not in the movie and it was 2 and half hours i was extremely irritated br br 3 the ending the ending was changed <UNK> <UNK> died jack <UNK> to death wendy never got hurt the overlook didn't blow up the ending was so cool in the book and the movie messed it up so horribly i was <UNK> <UNK> was never supposed to die but jack killed him with an <UNK> if they wanted to kill him at least have jack use a <UNK> <UNK> you never even saw a <UNK> <UNK> during the whole movie br br there are other things that i didn't like about the movie but there are things that were all right the camera angels were cool the blood coming out of the elevator didn't happen in the book was cool but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book to try to be scared at all i <UNK> reading the book before you see this movie i applaud stephen king for actually <UNK> to sign a contract to not <UNK> stanley <UNK> any more i would never have done that i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day i can't wait to see the 6 hour version at least it has the <UNK> animals br br rating 2 10
<START> remember these two stories <UNK> and in the first set in the not too distant future we see a young boy preparing for examination day the state i q test the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test upon arriving he is given an <UNK> and is curious as to why the <UNK> smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth the boy then asks puzzled again why wouldn't he it is later and the parents are sitting waiting <UNK> by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry but their son's i q level has <UNK> the national <UNK> and ask <UNK> would they like a private burial a <UNK> of a <UNK> scene a message from charity was a heart warming story about a <UNK> mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft <UNK> in the past and <UNK> into the history pages in the present a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion
<START> guns <UNK> buildings exploding cars crashing and that's just the first ten minutes br br this action packed film involving a rogue ex cia <UNK> who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot hence the title is pretty decent br br tough and <UNK> gary busey usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued after all he's carrying the entire show which doesn't mean there isn't a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith luke <UNK> mills watson r g armstrong henry <UNK> lincoln <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and several other forgotten character actors br br there's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story busey has to free a group of kidnapped american military <UNK> and return a high tech <UNK> a normal tank with a cheesy add on <UNK> to the top back to the states br br but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys this question is asked of course like in any film <UNK> on the cia but without getting preachy
<START> <UNK> is the latest <UNK> <UNK> of cheap scare tactics the kind that might make date movie <UNK> horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction br br john <UNK> plays a writer who's made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in <UNK> haunted <UNK> despite <UNK> by <UNK> and owners that ghosts <UNK> the <UNK> there is little to make him a real believer in the <UNK> when he learns of the history of room <UNK> at the overlook hotel no wait i mean <UNK> hotel in new york city he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book but samuel l jackson playing the hotel owner strongly attempts to <UNK> his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in <UNK> room since the <UNK> opening many years ago the story is simple and we as possible <UNK> must sit through jackson's lengthy <UNK> <UNK> br br in other words be afraid be very afraid br br of course it would be easy to convince audiences that they've just paid to see an edge of the seat thriller if it didn't take so long to build up to this point and also if what followed was a lot more than cheap <UNK> that become so frequent and <UNK> that eventually you might soon expect them the <UNK> in the room changes automatically the walls <UNK> with blood the <UNK> writer can't open the door etc and after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills you might sit and hope that at least you can be <UNK> by the ending with <UNK> of dream sequences and other derivative time <UNK> even that fails to <UNK> our doubts that before the movie is over we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable br br despite grand performances as always by <UNK> who essentially is the entire film most everyone else of note is wasted i e samuel l jackson in insignificant minor roles the true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating <UNK> <UNK> ghosts
<START> it had to be you is another sign that hollywood is running out of ideas this picture is about charlie hudson a former police officer turned author when charlie's fiancé goes out of town he's stuck with all of the wedding planning he spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets anna penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married the two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate <UNK> together this is when the plot gets boring charlie falls in love with anna and she has to choose between a safe life or charlie this movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else <UNK> <UNK> and natasha <UNK> give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch
<START> if you like a <UNK> soap opera this show is for you as fare as i am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes i just can't watch it anymore it is boring and slow and for a show that the <UNK> is based around 100 000 years ago if you base it on battlestar <UNK> <UNK> for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100 000 year old chevy <UNK> driving down the streets and people watching the 100 000 year old popular name brand <UNK> t v sets it also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show there is just to much of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook i think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad as fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as bsg was and it is a poor pre sequel to <UNK>
<START> ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from according to <UNK> <UNK> they are based on real people living out the adventures they write about and <UNK> this movie is quality family entertainment <UNK> amounts of violence and skimpy clothes at the worst the language is is also not a problem and the jokes are funny at all levels this is a <UNK> <UNK> look at <UNK> jones' without the over the top antics of michael myers i highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range
<START> at first glance this film looks like the <UNK> sutherland series 24 for the big screen with the focus on a plot to <UNK> the president of the united states a race against time and plenty of secret service agents the agency under the spotlight in the sentinel br br but wait the protagonist turns out to be michael <UNK> character pete <UNK> instead a veteran secret service agent famed for taking the bullet for reagan in 1981 the ss agents are specially trained to take the bullet which is what makes them special who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target but <UNK> gets <UNK> in the assassination plot and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of <UNK> into the plot all this because of his failure in a <UNK> test due to his <UNK> <UNK> of the first lady kim basinger <UNK> br br there are shades of clint eastwood's in the line of fire both featured aging actors and aging veteran has been heroes with a bit of a historical reference who took the bullet in their respective <UNK> of duty while eastwood's movie has a more enigmatic villain in john <UNK> the sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain <UNK> to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex <UNK> villains and the mole within the presidential detail with douglas on the run from the law he becomes similar to dr richard <UNK> of the fugitive hunting the proverbial one armed man while at the same time relying on his <UNK> to <UNK> fellow agents which turned out to be quite interesting to watch despite slick <UNK> it still <UNK> down to the performance and <UNK> of individual agents br br <UNK> sutherland and eva longoria top tv stars of today from 24 and desperate <UNK> get <UNK> into support roles as the secret service <UNK> who are looking into <UNK> <UNK> involvement in the assassination plot and at times seem to have <UNK> off the pages of <UNK> with their <UNK> skills the beautiful couple had chemistry that could have <UNK> x <UNK> fox <UNK> and dana <UNK> but alas these two had very little to do here we know the reason why they're in the movie and that is to get their fans into the theatres also <UNK> role seemed unable to shake off her sexy mama <UNK> and here has her in fairly low cut <UNK> sutherland actually tells her to cover up and tight pants <UNK> fest for fellow agents br br nonetheless it's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world and the typical <UNK> that they face daily including the following up on every <UNK> threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world it's a decent suspense and <UNK> thriller with enough subplots to keep you entertained but one thing though like most ending action sequences this one has a big enough <UNK> for you to fly a <UNK> jet through
<START> i should have listened i was warned and still i paid money for this after reading all the reviews after knowing the original is so bad it's good and that part 2 does not fit into that category at all still even then i couldn't resist exactly what happened here part one was hilarious it had so much politically <UNK> and other crazy fat entertainment and this one there just couldn't possibly be a worse sequel on god's green earth not basket case 2 hell not even <UNK> 2 this is truly the worst sequel in history and that's really saying something considering the groundbreaking bottom of the barrel qualities of the original criminally insane part 2 was just a completely different brand of bad shot on video zero score zero entertainment value 1 3 consists of flashbacks of the original and on top of all that crazy fat <UNK> has lost a portion of her <UNK> i mean honestly is this some kind of sick joke <UNK> a lot nick <UNK> 1 1
<START> <UNK> pure delight from beginning to end not a laugh riot but a more subtle sophisticated humor what a <UNK> of great scenes and character actors including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ian <UNK> harry shannon and jason <UNK> sr br br cary grant is at the building sight of his new home which is at that point being framed a young carpenter played by future tarzan lex barker asks him if he wants his <UNK> to be <UNK> or some such thing that only a carpenter would know grant not wanting to appear ignorant replies in the <UNK> at that barker yells up to his mates ok boys he wants 'em <UNK> so <UNK> 'em out a second later you hear the ripping and <UNK> sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards all grant can do is <UNK> br br yes the movie is dated you'd never see that many <UNK> working at once on a single family home and a place like that in <UNK> of all places would probably run a few million bucks br br a classic movie that is really a treasure
<START> evidently not many people have seen this movie because no one is <UNK> any more comments this is not a movie to be missed after all it has won the george <UNK> award as well as the <UNK> award paul <UNK> should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie eugene logan who was a co writer on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity or loss of it by being a technical <UNK> to truman <UNK> movie the glass house this movie is now available on dvd if anyone is interested i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical <UNK> to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies
<START> a reasonable effort is summary for this film a good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement maggie smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given other actors were just dreadful a terrible portrayal it wasn't very funny and so it didn't really achieve its genres as it wasn't particularly funny and it wasn't dramatic the only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance target audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages a very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn't as good and who the target audiences were etc however maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of <UNK> br br 4
<START> it is finally coming out the first season will be available march 2007 it is currently airing on abc family from 4 5 <UNK> eastern time monday through friday the last episode will air on december 19th at 4 30 i missed it the first 100 times around i wish i could buy the whole series right now who does she pick i have to write 10 lines in order to <UNK> to the first comment what am i going to say la da da de de la da da de de nope only up to 8 how do i get to 9 almost almost <UNK> 9 now i need 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 i missed counted this is only number 8 <UNK> <UNK> is pretty awesome too almost to 10 almost <UNK>
<START> an hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script documentary hits all the beats plot points character <UNK> <UNK> moments of <UNK> and <UNK> and the <UNK> but insane <UNK> of selling a script or getting an agent in hollywood and all the fleeting fantasy realizing but ultimately empty <UNK> of passage attendant to being <UNK> into the system <UNK> and rice capture the moment of thinking you're finally a player only to find that what goes up comes down fast and in a blind <UNK> fashion that for inexplicable reasons hollywood has moved on and left you checking your heart your dreams and your <UNK> pitch is a must see for students in film school to taste the mind and ego bashing <UNK> that is for most the road that must be traveled to sell <UNK> and one's projects in hollywood if your teacher or guru has never been there they can't tell you what you need to prepare for this <UNK> to enter the <UNK> talent is necessary but far from sufficient
<START> this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend there are laughs <UNK> and some very interesting little <UNK> stories going on here the actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty <UNK> beach life is full of diverse <UNK> and personality types the australian coast scenery is simply splendid to see what a place to visit to say the least and one day it may become my <UNK> i really enjoy this movie and every time i watch it i enjoy it more i would love to see more of these characters and i always wonder what became of them although the plot is somewhat soft this movie is of course a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous <UNK> beach with these wonderful <UNK> and their own personal stories
<START> i remember loving this show when i was a kid i thought the helicopter was the coolest thing i've seen it was ultra high tech for it's time it could <UNK> enemy fire do all sorts of <UNK> in the air and take down nearly anything in it's way now i go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is the casts members are hardly compelling there are a lot of cheesy moments and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking and nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious <UNK> of grainy low quality stock footage lot of the <UNK> appear to date from the vietnam war era br br <UNK> has basically the same theme as knight rider except the crime fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car after watching a few episodes i found myself utterly bored i do however love the theme music
<START> this is one creepy movie <UNK> than anything david lynch and that shows what a great director polanski is since this is not his usual type of work and it is brilliant br br it all starts of with <UNK> moves into a <UNK> block in paris he soon learns that the previous tenant a young woman committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it he also believes that they are trying to do the same to him what results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia br br the whole production has classical horror written all over it from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor <UNK> terror building up br br are they all out to kill him or maybe just drive him mad is there a difference find out for yourself 10 10
<START> while the <UNK> <UNK> and technical attributes of this movie may in fact be laughable to some i have never been able to <UNK> the images this movie <UNK> on my young and <UNK> mind when i first saw it at around 8 years of age the story of this girl's survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years and i have thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything i have seen br br the fact that this is a true story and the fact that i was only a child when i first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie each time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s i would be <UNK> to the television drinking in each scene with an interest i cannot explain i suppose watching this for the first time as an adult and with a jaded view of the world it may not be as enjoyable to some i actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so i could show this movie to my son br br this like many other movies is not for everyone if you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories are partial to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and or the amazon then i believe you might enjoy this movie as much as i have been enjoying it for the past 30 years
<START> there's really not a lot to say about las vegas lady it's harmless enough but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s the movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it <UNK> to be the plot is a <UNK> of the tired old casino robbery storyline that's been done to death except in the case of las vegas lady i think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year old the plan involves three women  one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the circus <UNK> building one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her <UNK> that's pretty much it intricate huh other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts the other women involved in the plot aren't particularly memorable las vegas lady co stars stuart <UNK> when not <UNK> stevens his involvement in the movie is <UNK> by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film br br i really wanted to like this movie it does have that 70s feel to it that i always enjoy and some nice shots of las vegas circa 1975 but the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4 10  and that's probably <UNK> it in the end las vegas lady is a waste of some perfectly good <UNK>
<START> by 1941 columbia was a full <UNK> major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm paramount or <UNK> that's the best thing that could be said about adam had four sons a <UNK> soap opera with almost <UNK> bland performances by ingrid bergman top billed for the first time in an american film and warner <UNK> bergman plays a <UNK> this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another hired as <UNK> to <UNK> four sons and staying on with one <UNK> caused by the stock market crash of <UNK> until the boys are grown men serving in world war i just about everyone in the movie is so <UNK> good it's a relief when susan <UNK> as the <UNK> enters <UNK> through  she's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she's clearly <UNK> bette davis and <UNK> leigh it's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains <UNK> and the ending is utterly preposterous no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted the valley of decision four years later
<START> first off i must stress how rare it is that i take the time to comment on a movie that i have seen it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how i felt about a film that said of the hundreds of movies i have watched i have seen some of the most brilliant <UNK> the scariest the woman in black the funniest shark attack iii <UNK> and now the worst vampires vs zombies br br the first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny for those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it's funny look elsewhere it is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant with a title such as this you should know what you're getting into that said there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that <UNK> the movie making world this is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more artsy methods to creating a film this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held <UNK> for making terrible movies br br this movie suffers from the over used saying i don't know where to start truly everything about this movie is broken from the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as vampires vs zombies some of the following problems are 1 scene <UNK> it's clear that the director the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page in one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera <UNK> on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car you are expecting the person inside to get out but there is a and this is no exaggeration 10 second at least <UNK> between the camera comes on and the director says action to where anything happens on screen the viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound no movement just the stereotypical dead air that radio or tv <UNK> dread where was the editing 2 acting a forgivable offense in most cases you can't expect a movie like this to have oscar winners after all but vampires vs zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level these actors were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to <UNK> the lines better than these fools my only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from resident evil on <UNK> but that acting was even better br br 3 story wait what story again you can't expect this to be the greatest story ever told but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative why the vampires who are the characters who are the bad guys are there good guys why all the lesbians but most importantly what's the deal with the zombies if you have seen this movie then you will understand what i mean but to those who haven't i'll be plain there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it it was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end br br there's so much more but i hope i've done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie
<START> i saw this on cable back in the late 1980's as i was a big wrestling fan since 1986 i saw this on vhs in a <UNK> <UNK> bin and bought it br br in 1998 i started training as a wrestler after the air force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling families and friends that wouldn't understand us the travel the <UNK> etc henry <UNK> is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is <UNK> a great way to separate himself the <UNK> character he played on happy days at the time plus look at the cast william daniels knight rider polly holiday alice and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sr if you get a chance watch it
<START> in my opinion a guy thing is a hilarious witty sexy romantic and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy i thought that jason lee and julia stiles <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> to be and his soon to be sexy cousin in law if you ask me they lit up the screen like magic you can also feel their chemistry between them before i wrap this up i'd like to say that the performances were top grade the direction was flawless the production design was nice the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed in conclusion to anyone who's a fan of jason lee or julia stiles i recommend this movie you're in for lots of laughs and thrills so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
<START> i think this is a great version i came on here before to help me find which version i should use and i went to jane eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version i do not regret picking this version and neither will you i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it there is nothing like the book and trust me if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it when you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that i would say god personally led me to this version it points to true love for a humans i would say god's love is greater if there is anything better i would like to see it but so far there is none like it
<START> i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures purple rain not only broke boundaries it set a decade the costumes the music the behavior and the dancing to this day my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution br br now the movie itself i just meant what i said in the title because for the most part this movie itself is made by the music the acting please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and <UNK> their speech about <UNK> was just beyond hilarious i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie br br prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music while the movie and acting is pretty bad this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too this movie defined the 80's so just have fun with it prince would want it that way just to party on down oh boy that sounded lame br br 9 10
<START> this is a b series film noir and my vote reflects its <UNK> in that genre i saw this film last night at a left bank cinema in paris where it opened a two week film noir run the film has some flaws yes but far too many delicious elements to ignore br br as the previous reviewer <UNK> the <UNK> scene is incredible b movies could <UNK> where a movies were forbidden to enter and the plot is intriguing regarding <UNK> tone however i beg to disagree to me he's suitably mysterious just the right <UNK> of creepy one must bear in mind that there's a sort of german <UNK> happening here the director robert <UNK> was a german who came to hollywood during the war and so an air of exaggeration fits into the whole of this film at least it does for me br br however it's the gorgeous ella raines who in only her third credited performance held this viewer <UNK> throughout the film a girl friday type with a strong resemblance to gene tierney it's a wonder that she didn't become a household name but she's so good here that i've just ordered another film of hers <UNK> off the internet and i can't wait to see it as well
<START> i enjoyed the first <UNK> comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second run theatre in the early <UNK> i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes <UNK> so closely after the <UNK> drawings but to me the cast was largely <UNK> their personalities <UNK> by the masks while the direction i think of as being unusually static and the photography murky the rating <UNK> down at the time was a <UNK> which means not worth sitting through even once br br still i too would jump at a chance to have a second look
<START> i just have to add in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet these other reviewers aren't joking around this really is the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see when the movie started i couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see br br they're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie it really does like the director took the family <UNK> camcorder before <UNK> cameras and computer non linear editing no other equipment lights sound gear etc grabbed some decent looking acting students and went out to shoot a movie no script just making it up as he went along br br when i watched it it was on my <UNK> tv so i only have one channel of audio left of right <UNK> at first i thought i'd hooked it up wrong the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog they recorded the sound on different bloody channels i mean there's movies that can be funny to watch so bad they're good kind of thing i'm not sure this is one of those i mean i'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better you know but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it br br as bad as they were the actors are the only good thing about this i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the <UNK> of her bath scene a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 but alas no if you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap throw in some gratuitous nudity worked for roger corman
<START> no wonder this was released straight to dvd here in australia no redeeming features what so ever the dialog was hokey the acting awful and the script sucked whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up to the far superior john <UNK> film <UNK> from the 80s well they must of been on something cause it was a bad idea amanda walsh was good in it as the eye candy love interest while matt <UNK> was good as the other main lead that is about it i would not recommend <UNK> the dead code to anyone check out <UNK> or the original <UNK> film both are better than this piece of crap
<START> shall we dance is an excellent film because it shows how something like dancing can <UNK> the life flow in the human spirit br br dance is seen as the expression of existence and the birth of <UNK> the is certainly the case with <UNK> at work he is a humble office <UNK> but place him on the dance floor and all his <UNK> up intensity is released surprisingly this release is <UNK> upon in japan due to the rigid culture of <UNK> at the start of the film all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance they will be <UNK> or deemed perverted for expressing their passion through dance br br this film is well worth watching to witness the <UNK> of human emotions and passions it will leave a smile on your face for days
<START> i occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes i try to enjoy it for it's basic idea which is helping a <UNK> family but several factors get in the way for me every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted which they are and tears flow seemingly on cue the attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional <UNK> and sad music is a real turn off for me the fact that everyone who <UNK> something to the house be it <UNK> or whoever has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying probably the biggest problem i have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family now i know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for disney abc but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights isn't life difficult enough for the average person why do i need help finding things to feel sad about why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative i know what is being done for these families is good but they are also being used for ratings you can't tell me they aren't being <UNK> sometimes on the crying i guess when i see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the u s could not afford for their children it really bothers me i can't help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of disney's money instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen tv and or personal shower that tells you the water <UNK> and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food clothes education and medical insurance i know so we can be entertained and have a good cry in terms of money i feel the same about oprah i don't think anyone can actually <UNK> the amount of money she possesses yes her recent reality show did good things but when she gave 30 000 to each losing contestant i'm sitting here thinking that's a years <UNK> for many many people if they're lucky don't get me started on game shows so i realize that extreme <UNK> home edition is doing good but forgive me if i see it as more self serving than giving of itself is there anyone out there that feels similar
<START> this is one of the most <UNK> relaxing and beautifully made animation films i've ever seen with beautiful music throughout the movie the sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie this movie is not just great for kids but adults too it teaches you lessons such as never forget who you are you can do whatever you stick your mind to and to brave and daring this movie can make you cry at times too which is always a nice touch in movies this movie is funny sad cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them and the movie spirit is definitely one of them with my vote of 9 10 stars for animation music and a wonderful idea for a movie it gave me a whole lot of spirit
<START> before i see on this film i see a lot of comments which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad br br what i really want to point out is the acting on woody <UNK> behalf he may not be in many parts of the film but when he appears or even the intro i was <UNK> by will smith's and woody <UNK> message they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on br br i am not a very sentimental person i believe that a good deed should not have <UNK> or pity behind it but a act to show redemption there is not many films that in my point of view can show this this is one of them that can br br i agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of suicide is a downfall however i do not believe that is the message the film is trying to send but sacrifice a bit to the extreme but that is the message in my opinion br br this film has potential the acting it is worth every penny the script is unbelievable from a person that doesn't really like watching drama films if you like drama this is a must go watch
<START> seeing as <UNK> sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv it was a <UNK> conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend 15 on this i also think this applies to eva longoria fans br br the movie revolves around a <UNK> that a secret service agent is planning to <UNK> the president as the investigation unfolds it seems the only likely candidate is the highly <UNK> pete michael douglas <UNK> innocence pete goes on the fun fugitive style to search for the truth br br it's solid but certainly not spectacular a decent cast a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty but you could certainly do far worse
<START> after seeing this film for the 3rd time now i think it is almost <UNK> worst film punch drunk love is poor in comparison to this i must say at the end when <UNK> gets thrown of the boat it is so funny the hair is different to his and i like it when he <UNK> everyone off this film should only be brought if your a true adam sandler fan br br the characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like the <UNK> which has the same people in it peter <UNK> who is one of the <UNK> trying to kill the australian bird br br this film lack depth and a decent story line and deserves to be in the bottom 100
<START> before we begin i have a fear of <UNK> this movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe that is what i love about this film the movie is kind of boring for that i take 3 stars off br br spoiler alert br br the movie revolves around dr alan feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him soon he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients killing co workers and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with br br end spoiler br br the movie is very bloody and gory i would recommend it if you are into gore br br i give this film 7 stars out of 10 dr alan <UNK> is not your normal everyday dentist
<START> this <UNK> drama is what you would expect from richard attenborough the man who gave us gandhi beautifully photographed <UNK> casted well written in the <UNK> <UNK> manner that hollywood <UNK> in the 30's and <UNK> accurate it stands out as a genre film <UNK> in its portrayal of native american or more appropriately for its canadian setting first nations culture and standing with black <UNK> as a wonderfully photographed piece of <UNK> country and its culture here circa 1934 this <UNK> portrait <UNK> drama from its subject <UNK> grey owl <UNK> a <UNK> raised in <UNK> england by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the red indian tales of his childhood that he went to canada disappeared into the woods and became a <UNK> and adopted son of an <UNK> band he was a vain man with a habit of marrying and <UNK> br br indian brides none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it for he was also an extraordinarily charming and <UNK> character one of his wives one smarter than he by most accounts <UNK> him into fame as a writer and early <UNK> for protecting the wild country of the north and this forms the focus of <UNK> tale the chemistry between brosnan and annie <UNK> as grey <UNK> wife <UNK> is engaging and if not <UNK> is nonetheless quite touching a good film when you need some time from the <UNK> crowd
<START> it's the early 80s there's a group of <UNK> old looking teens and there's a maniac stalking around yes this is <UNK> br br this movie is called pranks why is it called pranks i haven't the <UNK> idea unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat on balance not a great prank in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told but there you go br br the film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are <UNK> with cleaning out a <UNK> <UNK> they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose to combat this development they split up and wander about in the dark it ends in tears for most of them br br pranks is a badly made slasher movie the dvd release i viewed was the <UNK> one it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence this makes the dvd even more pointless because let's face it a slasher movie <UNK> of violence is a waste of time for slasher film and video nasty <UNK> only
<START> the <UNK> have over the 1980s produced a few decent <UNK> to <UNK> the title worst movie of all time and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes in fact this film can be regarded as <UNK> to the so bad it's good category right up there with the products of the likes of edward wood jr or doris <UNK> this explains the imdb voting pattern for this film with some people <UNK> out top marks br br anthony quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad it has to be seen to be believed
<START> why do i like <UNK> crime so much why do i chuckle or laugh out loud any time i think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie it's kind of hard to explain but i'll give it a try first of all it's very funny indeed in contrast to what lots of official reviews want you to believe but then again that depends entirely on your sense of humour so there is no sense in arguing about that often the humour is in the dialogue and often it is <UNK> comedy there is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck when the farmer drops them they just stand there by the road covered all over with cow s or whatever they are totally <UNK> then realizing the humour of the scene they one by one start laughing about themselves and <UNK> <UNK> as carlos looking and certainly <UNK> terrible <UNK> takes out some mouth <UNK> to at least do something about his breath simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again which leads to the second point the acting fred <UNK> lou diamond phillips william russ <UNK> <UNK> and corbin bernsen okay the latter <UNK> it a bit at times all fit and play their parts beautifully in fact you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film <UNK> there is the plot jim <UNK> the director and screenwriter is very laid back he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves more often than not there is no real action and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people who attempt to rob a bank although their boss bernsen does not seem to turn up <UNK> about each other and even <UNK> <UNK> like each other the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot totally impossible with all its twists and <UNK> yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details incidentally the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across because it per <UNK> <UNK> the plot in a very ironic way therefore take my advice watch this film but if you don't chuckle grin or smile during the first 10 minutes forget it it's not your type of film ps the only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay if you happen to know how do tell me
<START> no rubbish no where even near rubbish not an original thats the last thing that could be said of 2 4 children predictable certainly not although it was somewhat an unusual series for the bbc it was hilarious funny and witty i particularly liked <UNK> lang and john <UNK> who i believe <UNK> wonderfully gary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members i never quite new why it was can <UNK> till reading here today about gary <UNK> death at a relatively young age i do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type much more of them and show them here in israel thumbs way up
<START> billy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the bloody <UNK> film assassin from 1993 film love to kill hong kong 1993 is among the strongest products of the category iii boom that inhabited the hk cinema in early nineties it consisted of films with strong sex nudity and violence more or less gratuitous and shock <UNK> only love to kill definitely belongs to the more category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness br br the hk psycho anthony wong from the award winning the <UNK> story by herman <UNK> from the same year plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture <UNK> and rape his young wife elizabeth lee <UNK> <UNK> who for some reason doesn't leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed <UNK> a policeman danny lee the famous police character actor from films like dr <UNK> 1992 by billy <UNK> and co directed by lee and the killer 1989 by john woo to name just a few however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but anthony naturally doesn't like this at all and leads it all into the typical ultra mean spirited and graphic finale during a rain storm br br the film is almost completely without any serious merits as it's just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular the imagery and happenings are something never found in the western cinema at least in mainstream and it all becomes even more mind blowing when some most <UNK> for <UNK> like violence and <UNK> witnessed by a child are broken in these films so often that reading the <UNK> alone would make most viewers feel sick and that goes perfectly especially for this film too br br the film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned dr <UNK> which practically started the whole boom in 1992 usually the music and soundtrack in hk films is interesting and adds to the imagery especially in these terror films also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film <UNK> especially in the finale in blue colors and camera <UNK> as does assassin too and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera otherwise there's nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the <UNK> <UNK> br br the actors and actresses are talented and professional and so don't make the film any worse with their acting still the film has the usual hk humor in it which makes the sick goings on even <UNK> as some humor is thrown into the soup that includes some jokes about danny lee's <UNK> and so on something that could never be found in the western serious films either and that thing usually destroys <UNK> otherwise noteworthy hk films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and masses br br the film has a very high <UNK> level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of <UNK> wife in various ways she gets raped and <UNK> beaten and kicked by her husband we also get to see some flashbacks from <UNK> own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now these flashback scenes mostly at the end of the film include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is <UNK> up for example the hits of an axe and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene again something that only hk exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with the ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman <UNK> his axe and meets also some nails for example on his furious way br br the film is also genuinely pretty suspicious in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should never be taken as entertainment mostly i mean rape the version i saw i've seen two versions includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible i'm not sure does the hk audience really like imagery like this but i think no one with some sense for morality in films entertainment would never accept or make something like it women get <UNK> and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the <UNK> of the men seem almost tame when compared to the females br br the other version i saw the newly released dvd in hk without subtitles has this table brutality scene in a much longer form than the subtitled <UNK> dvd which is otherwise identical to the hk version i've also heard that the old hk <UNK> is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film it is impossible to say how uncut versions these that have been released or shown <UNK> are obviously plenty of footage has been cut out possibly even before the theatrical release br br the film is written by law <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> wing <UNK> the former having written also films like dr <UNK> the <UNK> story and <UNK> kirk wong 1988 but out of his other films that i've seen love to kill is the most gratuitous dr <UNK> and the <UNK> story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one the harrowing torture imagery of the <UNK> story the victim being the criminal is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example but there's none of this in love to kill it is just honest <UNK> and <UNK> made exploitation which is by the way produced by a veteran director kirk organized crime <UNK> <UNK> 1993 crime story 1993 wong br br love to kill earns no more than 2 10 from me as i don't have too high appreciation on films like this hk cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like love to kill are only commercial <UNK> living among the real pieces of the art
<START> this show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious <UNK> hard drive space i didn't expect much and i actually received less not only do i expect this show to be canceled by the second episode i cannot believe that <UNK> will ever attempt to use the <UNK> ad campaign ever again i would have preferred spending a night checking my daughter's hair for head <UNK> than watching this piece of refuse i wonder what abc passed on to make this show fit into the <UNK> fall <UNK> perhaps a hospital crime <UNK> reality show featuring the <UNK> duck in the event that i failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good
<START> after viewing whipped at a <UNK> screening at the <UNK> the other night i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed the audience was laughing all the way through unfortunately every territory was already sold so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both <UNK> and over <UNK> i agree with the comment that whipped should not be pitched as a male sex and the city mainly because unlike sex and the city whipped is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously whipped <UNK> fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldn't dare also the film that i screened at the <UNK> had more of a plot and story than <UNK> <UNK> and sex and the city combined whipped never <UNK> down for a beat and provided the audience with non stop comedy the performances of amanda <UNK> and the rest of the cast were all rock solid which only made the film more impressive considering the budget
<START> reading my review of the house that screamed many may assume that i'm some 14 year old who thinks scream is considered classic horror this is not the case as i'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life but admittedly i'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher zombie ghost cannibal etc types of horror films so i do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster paced just like someone who can appreciate different music painting or in this case film but not necessarily like them i can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film i just don't br br the house that screamed is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for <UNK> girls the heavy handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand or whip in some cases to keep the girls in line she has a young son who creeps around and <UNK> on the girls while they shower in their <UNK> no less and meanwhile girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus br br i can see why the house that screamed is often compared to <UNK> which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their <UNK> but this film is so dull and <UNK> that i could barely stay awake i'm all for tension and suspense in horror films but this film held neither for me luckily i wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one so i can't say i was really disappointed the house that screamed just <UNK> the fact that i personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's this isn't a hard and fast rule but those that i have enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception probably a must see for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films but as i don't really know too many fans of that sort of material i can't really recommend this one 4 10
<START> after the failure of the <UNK> at the box office cecil b demille stopped doing films about non american history his films for the next thirteen years were about our history from jean <UNK> to world war ii dr <UNK> the first in order of production was this film starring gary cooper as wild bill <UNK> with jean arthur as <UNK> jane james <UNK> was buffalo bill john <UNK> not a villain as usual was general george a <UNK> and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn the villains were led by charles <UNK> selling arms to the indians and porter hall as jack <UNK> who killed wild bill <UNK> br br basically the film takes up the history of the u s after the civil war lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that lee has <UNK> lincoln talks about the need to secure the west more about this point later then he <UNK> he has to go to the theater that april <UNK> must have been very busy for <UNK> in virginia city he <UNK> a <UNK> to errol flynn at the request of <UNK> hopkins on the same date br br actually while lincoln was concerned about the west his immediate thoughts on the last day of his <UNK> were about <UNK> the former <UNK> states and it's citizens into the union as soon as possible it was <UNK> that occupied his attention not the west except for the problems of <UNK> and his french controlled forces in mexico against <UNK> but he had been involved in actual problems with the west in <UNK> he sent <UNK> general john <UNK> the loser at second <UNK> to <UNK> to put down a serious indian war by the <UNK> the subject of <UNK> <UNK> novel <UNK> lake <UNK> incompetent against lee and jackson turned out to be quite effective here and the revolt was <UNK> br br however with all <UNK> actual attention to western problems it is <UNK> that he says as cooper repeats at least once the frontier should be secure there is nothing to say he could not have said it but it is hardly a profound <UNK> by a leading <UNK> like saying teddy <UNK> said eat a good breakfast every morning for your health it is not a profound statement of policy it is at best a statement of recognizable fact cooper turning it into a minor <UNK> like <UNK> version of the monroe <UNK> is ridiculous typical of the way <UNK> scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them br br however this is not a <UNK> mistake the <UNK> is an adventure film and as such it has the full benefit of demille the film creator of spectacle as such it is well worth watching but not as a <UNK> on <UNK> political ideas or his <UNK> legacy
<START> fascinating i approached i am curious yellow and it's companion piece with great <UNK> i'd read numerous reports on its widely <UNK> controversy and explicit sex what i got wasn't this but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other i sincerely believe that the majority of the <UNK> who felt the film was <UNK> or <UNK> approached the film as if it were pornography perhaps this is pornography assuming pornography is something intended to <UNK> the senses but it is intentionally un erotic lena the protagonist throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring her breasts may be <UNK> her <UNK> unusually large her <UNK> fat and her face <UNK> but by the end of the film the audience comes to identify with her and accept her faults as human this touch gives her even more believability out necessity had the director cast a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the effect would have been <UNK> i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece be prepared to <UNK> much thought in this deliberately paced film the patient and <UNK> viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream
