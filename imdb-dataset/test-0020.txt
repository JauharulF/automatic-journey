<START> robert altman nicolas <UNK> john luc <UNK> you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy these and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream but created it for those that complain that they did not <UNK> to the original story of the opera how often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film it is the mood that counts this is what i believe the directors of these movies were doing creating a contemporary mood for old operas for the most part they succeed wonderfully with all these operas who is going to like them all we could have used more beverly br br finally what is art even opera without a few naked women
<START> iron eagle may not be the most believable film plot wise but the characters are well written and very well acted if you cannot believe the characters the film is a flop br br i believe the photography especially the <UNK> photography is superb i believe it is far superior to top gun to which it is endlessly compared it is one of the best pieces of <UNK> photography i have seen the soundtrack by basil forgive the spelling is great and <UNK> well with the rock tunes i wish that portion of the soundtrack were available br br jason does well as the teenager who suddenly has to grow up in a rush and and the realities of life death and <UNK> lou <UNK> is <UNK> as <UNK> both hard bitten and yet human as he recalls pilot deaths br br there are lots of movies out there that you watch once and don't care to watch again then there are those movies that get you for one aspect or another and you can watch it again and again iron eagle is that kind of movie
<START> this movie came as a huge disappointment the anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain but i expected to tie up all the loose ends unfortunately it didn't it added more plot holes than it resolved and confused more than it <UNK> the animation and voice acting were great but with an idiotic plot dull setting most of the movie doesn't even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the <UNK> world and disappointing ending ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no <UNK> and he <UNK> it was altogether pretty lackluster do yourself a favor disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie and read the manga
<START> a <UNK> 50 dvd can be a <UNK> and this was one that sort of paid off br br a decent saturday night type movie that entertains if you <UNK> over the obvious plot flaws special effects are a bit few and far between with some <UNK> and why does london always look as if it's in the 60's br br if it had the budget of say <UNK> then i'm sure it would have performed better at the box office as the story is quite a good one br br overall is <UNK> to b movie history but if you see it for <UNK> 50 then it's worth buying
<START> k one day my father picked up a movie with a cover got home with my mom and we were like <UNK> lets watch this new movie we never saw before ok so it started interesting start cool robots and disgusting gore <UNK> on a strange planet actually it was <UNK> wasn't it <UNK> i could tell the whole story but i rather not point wtf never ever pick up a movie with a lame ass name and seriously don't ever i mean ever judge a book by its cover <UNK> tape it looked like an interesting movie however it was a slap to the face for sci fi movies its disgusting i mean it was so bad i just started laughing i swear it to be serious i cant describe the stupidity it killed more then a million brain cells of mine i can't even write a descent critique its that bad <UNK> and i <UNK> prepare you for something <UNK> <UNK> mechanical <UNK> <UNK> sorry just had to say it its so funny think of it as a or a parody of sorts for sci fi movies its classic batman laughs but in a new <UNK> what the hell was this director thinking
<START> i do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking by making the same type of clichéd film over and over where the bad guys bad girls in this case win weak acting and very predictable nothing original about it this same movie has been made over and over again not different from goodbye lover 1989 slow burn 2005 or at least ten other movies with the exact same storyline and ending there are a lot of holes in the movie too it is as if they ran out of money and just stopped filming or perhaps they ran out of ideas but do not waste your time with this one it will only leave you upset by having wasted your time watching it
<START> just watched it then it is pretty damn awesome the fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool it's totally like a video game in parts with some amazing hand to hand combat in there br br this film is for the fans to those who loved this world once before and spent time with its friends gather again and <UNK> your time besides this ominous opening the story was not very hard to follow and <UNK> never played a final fantasy game i think it pays to be familiar with role playing games in general knowledge of the genre kinda helps you grasp some of it better i think though that if you pay attention and accept what the film throws at you it's quite easy to understand there is a lot that isn't <UNK> explained and if you demand that it should be then you will probably be confused and irritated br br watching the film is like being dropped into the middle of some grand saga and having to put as much of the puzzle together as possible i like that approach you get caught up in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through but like i said just be accepting if a weird red lion thing that talks turns up and starts kicking ass and taking names and the other characters just say he's an old friend accept it and move on you don't need a biopic flashback or a tell all sit me down you are an <UNK> here of something beyond your experience and br br so fantastic graphics and animation great voice acting cool video game <UNK> music involving story and characters and maybe some of the coolest fights you'll see in a while it's worth seeing and while it is for the fans it is perfectly accessible for people like me that have never played the games
<START> consider i know all action hero is lighting a cigarette in the darkness while tries to hide seek the bad guys probably to give a <UNK> light to say here i am coming br br that's one of the 100 scenes you can laugh at i think the movie should in the comedy category br br awful directing awful script bad acting cheap special effects they used a tunnel so they can hide there acting in darkness br br 3 out of 10 that also for making me laugh looking at those pathetic mistakes
<START> live together die alone is divided into three main story lines and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode so when you put all of them together you have a great 3 episode it was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character <UNK> who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point but it worked his <UNK> is absolutely fascinating to watch both informative about the past of the island the <UNK> station itself and honestly moving <UNK> and penny seem magically connected to each other even when they are on opposite ends of the world and both characters are beautifully acted it's hard not to cry when <UNK> reads <UNK> letter the action inside the <UNK> is edge of your seat tense as locke is determined not to allow the button to get pushed again convinced it was all just a psychological experiment <UNK> gradually realizes the consequences of this decision and <UNK> is locked outside and tries desperately to get back in the melting of the clock and <UNK> i was wrong are unforgettable moments the outside action has jack kate <UNK> and <UNK> captured by the others due to michael's betrayal after they make a puzzling discovery connected to the pearl and henry <UNK> 's game changing return as the <UNK> leader even the least important plot line <UNK> <UNK> and sun <UNK> to the beach where the others are supposedly camping contains one of the greatest <UNK> mysteries of the show the giant statue that's almost entirely missing except for a foot with four <UNK> in short emotion history mythology adventure suspense the threat of <UNK> a ray of hope a classic lost episode 1 2 out of 4
<START> for those too young to remember or too old to have been part of the hype the michael jackson <UNK> in the early to mid 80's was at a fever pitch like the hype about titanic except this just didn't let up every song every video every word <UNK> by michael was important nothing similar had been seen since the <UNK> of the beatles br br i remember seeing this video for the first time at a roller <UNK> <UNK> everyone stopped <UNK> there was no question as to whether you were a michael jackson fan or not you were everyone crowded around the projection screen and watched the video br br this is probably one of the longest music videos ever made and definitely the best it <UNK> gets 2 on the <UNK> mtv top 100 videos 1 is always the flavor of the month and somehow whatever was 1 of all time slips past 2 to make way for the new 1 go figure and thriller became a phenomenon in and of itself br br if you ever get the chance you must watch the video not just the <UNK> shown on mtv or <UNK> if necessary you should search out making of thriller at a video rental store hey your parents probably made you watch beatles and <UNK> footage because it was important well this is important too
<START> a hilariously funny movie of course u gotta have a sense of humour to be able to appreciate it the music is excellent reminded me of 50 60's hindi music which is a <UNK> nowadays worth the go check it out
<START> no real plot no character development no <UNK> level direction but seriously were you really expecting any of this the only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious nearly on the same level as <UNK> sure the ending drags a bit but if cameo didn't crack you up you must be the worst <UNK> boy in the history of <UNK> boys <UNK> baron cohen is possibly the greatest comedian alive and here he gets more laughs than jude law on a nude beach i dare you not to laugh br br if you can pull the ten foot pole out of your behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some well timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character see this stupid movie you'll be glad you did keep it real
<START> i will be honest and say i gave up on watching it somewhere mid way and then fast forward with a few breaks then i came back here and read many of the reviews already made br br maybe is just me and i can not help it but this cartoon to north american society seems to have a purpose of lets save them from themselves and iraq comes to mind right away it seems to me that this is a justification or part of for another invasion with good intentions br br the lady to me seems a self <UNK> person and i frankly got annoyed at her portrait of trying to raise pity and feel for her well in this case this could never happen because just like a history teacher has already mentioned here i need to know how come her family was so wealthy above average manage to keep that were they playing both sides maybe and send her to paris now if this would have been made after a poor girl's biography i could see myself having certain emotions but as it stands its release timing this is just pure propaganda movie even worse since its cartoon it <UNK> the soft side of too well for its own good in order to possibly be taken serious br br besides there are those clichés regarding gays well a woman that fights toward winning her rights should not have at least some compassion for the <UNK> of society just like her the message is obviously self indulgent from the view of a <UNK> class member br br i only give it 2 stars because its production and related stuff a propaganda movie obviously has interests in convincing <UNK> my thoughts and therefore generally is well done appealing to certain visual emotions that i can not deny i might have as well
<START> <UNK> certainly isn't your average run of the mill giallo and that's no bad thing unlike his previous effort the fifth <UNK> which was your <UNK> giallo <UNK> film almost all of the giallo <UNK> and instead of murder the focus is very on psychological mystery it's obvious from the outset that this is going to be an entirely bizarre film as the film opens up with a scene set on the moon things don't get any <UNK> after that as the <UNK> sequence turns out to be the dream of alice a troubled woman alice is tormented by dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon which have apparently come from a viewing of a film called on the <UNK> after several things go wrong for her alice decides to go to a mostly deserted former tourist spot named upon her arrival she is surprised as the people she meets seem to already know her alice also meets a young red headed girl who also seems to already know her the girl tells alice she looks exactly like nicole except <UNK> and with shorter hair br br the fact that <UNK> doesn't feature much in the way of sex murder and other giallo <UNK> puts it somewhat on the back foot with it's primary audience from the beginning as most people going into this film aren't going to get what they were expecting or probably wanted but on the other hand <UNK> <UNK> respect for the fact that it doesn't just follow on from what went before it by 1975 the giallo had started to lose it's popularity and many of the films coming out around this period with a few very notable exceptions were merely <UNK> of what came before so <UNK> would have been taking a big chance on this film <UNK> <UNK> gives a strong performance in the lead role and the fact that she's not the <UNK> giallo heroine isn't really important the mystery builds nicely throughout and while it can become a little turgid at times <UNK> is generally speaking intriguing for the duration it probably won't come as a surprise to many once they get there that the ending doesn't make much sense and doesn't really clear anything up but it nicely adds to the bizarre cult value of the film and all in all i give <UNK> a thumbs up
<START> this is a very very odd film one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself the film begins with a jaded professor <UNK> his class because the students have the <UNK> to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is you can tell very quickly that this man is a total <UNK> finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self importance additionally he seems tired and bored with the <UNK> of life br br later in the film he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head oddly this is only half way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature <UNK> novels one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them br br see this weird film it's amazingly compelling and not like anything i've ever seen before
<START> a colleague from work told me to watch this movie since he considered this movie to be one of the best movies ever so i did watch it first i have to admit that i dislike mainstream movies and prefer to watch movies with a real meaning br br and this is the point why i dislike this movie it doesn't have any meaning it's just a combination of funny stupid boring entertaining absurd and thrilling pieces br br at first i thought that this movie could be a real mystery thriller as the german <UNK> read but the movie was too mysterious for me br br david lynch may be able to make a combination of the most different images but the composition tastes to me as <UNK> as a combination of milk with beer both for themselves are pretty good but together
<START> if it weren't for the editing out of curse words and a <UNK> <UNK> when one character give another the finger it would be easy to mistake this low budget <UNK> for a sci fi channel pilot the plot about the <UNK> attempts to destroy a group of it originally trained as military weapons ends <UNK> enough with the hero himself gifted in pursuit of a <UNK> survivor bent on revenge alas the movie is talky boring predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects top billed louis <UNK> jr has a minor role as the evil government <UNK> who <UNK> the program and now wants to eliminate all <UNK> he walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that demands little
<START> this is probably one of the best portuguese movies i ever saw i absolutely enjoyed the plot because by the way the story was developing you would get more involved on how their world was really upside down there is just only one part that doesn't really seem to fit in the movie which is the girls' strip it does not add anything important to the story it looks like it's just there for a men entertaining purpose the ending is a bit unexpected though at the same time somewhat expected if you don't understand then follow me after so many strange <UNK> the viewer is so used to <UNK> that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships like and sounds totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie but most of all <UNK> <UNK> is a movie that makes you think hard trying to solve the mysterious laugh your head off with their unlucky lives and mess with your perception of what can happen in just a few minutes when you turn your back away from something for all that i rate it 8 10
<START> i enjoyed the acting in this movie except for the sister she reminded me of <UNK> on friends i could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious br br my main problems with the movie were the <UNK> ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother in law the guy falling out of the exploding car maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she <UNK> him and rushed him to a hospital maybe then i could have gone for the ending i think somebody needed to die in the execution scene mainly the brother in law he was such a pain in the ass anyway or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute i could have even bought into the brother in law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films br br it is worth watching again and as i always say it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author
<START> being a huge street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous film street fighter ii the animated movie i was really looking forward to this one br br however it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose most of the characters i could not associate with and it just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter film so superior br br there are some good points however the animation is superb
<START> i thought i was going to see a <UNK> movie instead i saw a movie that was trying to make the audience me make the decision to accept christ in my life or risk going to hell the whole <UNK> thing was one big red <UNK> the acting in it was pretty pathetic in fact it looked as though some people from an <UNK> church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie all the characters talked as though they were in church <UNK> with other church members it wasn't real life dialog at all i wish i had read some reviews before seeing this movie so i wouldn't have wasted my money on it if on the other hand you are into the whole church scene in a big way and want to see a <UNK> of how to push your views no matter how <UNK> onto other people then by all means go see it
<START> you looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast well locate this little sleeper john <UNK> and billy bob are great in this little plot <UNK> don't forget the cameo by jamie lee curtis a touch of the 60's a touch of the prince and the <UNK> and dash of that <UNK> gold makes for a little story
<START> i'll admit that the first time i managed to catch sci <UNK> sci fi prime was last week but despite the fact that i was a huge <UNK> fan coming into the experience <UNK> is now easily my favorite of the four shows br br unlike most modern sci fi shows including <UNK> the two new star trek series this show manages to be fun without coming across as fodder for mst3k
<START> czech movie goers may have enjoyed and rated this film highly because it was czech but i found it to be trite tedious moronic boring and insipid again i suspect <UNK> in order to increase sales of this dog of a film amazon describes this film as being about a couple of <UNK> that refuse to grow up but i will go one further i think it is about two <UNK> that have entered a state of <UNK> and perform actions that make no sense to anyone i have been told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the film and i would believe it when he saw his performance he probably realized what a gosh awful job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid <UNK> embarrassment was to make the big exit which i am sure was much more dramatic and a much better performance that he had done in <UNK> spring don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance it's nothing but a dog in a <UNK>
<START> every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen it's cinema very at its best br br <UNK> blues is that film set in 1960s <UNK> new york the story <UNK> a rock solid woman who is the foundation for her community this based on a true story film is told from a child she accepted as her own this child <UNK> <UNK> hudson wrote the screenplay br br emmy winner s stars as <UNK> a woman who has wit drive and determination for helping others in her <UNK> home she does this as she <UNK> with infidelity from her young lover bill crosby played by the oscar nominated <UNK> howard br br but make no mistake see this film for the amazing performance of who is brilliant in this role she <UNK> a person we have all known and perhaps love br br <UNK> blues is already on dvd be sure to pick it up at your local video story today br br has already won an emmy golden globe and screen actors <UNK> for this role br br howard has an oscar nomination for his role in <UNK> flow
<START> this is a strange little forgotten movie from the late eighties it's one of those large cast kitchen sink movies that delivers some good gags if you like the people in this one give it a shot
<START> reading through most of the other reviews i tend to agree with most of the comments the one thing that i would add is the disjointed way the movie has been directed and produced i think that some of these new wave movie makers think that they are being clever using unusual sometimes jerky camera angles and <UNK> from one scene to another it goes down well with these movie festivals and with some of these indie type critics but it <UNK> the movie for me i noticed in the reviews one comment saying that none of this movie makers films have become blockbusters this would maybe prove my point as the film has that to feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film appears to be lacking a smooth flow as for the comment about <UNK> sutherland being a big name to put on the poster i would bet he <UNK> when watching the final cut this is a story with real potential <UNK> by trying to be different in it's production worth watching but not many would come back for a second view
<START> this is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to <UNK> even being a hardcore mario fan can make you dislike this game you can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easy or you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics not a <UNK> fan huge excitement music or game play i know a lot of people that say it is amazing and others who think its the worst mario ever it really depends on the type of <UNK> fan you are i personally love this game and i think it is the best <UNK> game but you should determine that for yourself so i think you should absolutely get it if you are the right <UNK> fan but if you love the classics too much you may not like it so try it out yourself
<START> an extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast one of the few shows that i try to watch on a regular basis glad to see <UNK> in a recurring role but feel andre <UNK> is <UNK> he is one intense actor hope cbs gives it a better time <UNK> next season
<START> this program is certainly my favorite non sitcom television comedy australia produces very little good programs most of the tv which i watch and i live in australia is from the us and england br br the funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is like when they went past numerous security <UNK> at the <UNK> pretending to be canadian <UNK> br br the show is made up of pre filmed stunts general satirical discussion of current world events and sometimes on stage skits these all come together to make a fabulous extremely funny tv show the segments like ad road test and message from <UNK> bin <UNK> are hilarious for anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical tv comedy then this is definitely the show you should watch br br all the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour br br i would rate it 10 10
<START> i am so impressed really i expected cheesy <UNK> humor and nothing else br br ok there's a ton of pretty geeky humor but the movie is so well done the acting is quite good br br the dialog while <UNK> cheesy at times i guess to <UNK> to the <UNK> crowd is not bad at all at times it's even dare i say great br br when the female <UNK> who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual min max type gets all these additional attacks seem right i did not check the rules it was cool br br the sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie br br the story moves right along the transitions from game world to real world are well done a male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female and sometimes by himself pretty clever i thought br br the guy who decided to play a female but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs he even said tag at one point and the female walked on to play the role sorry i did not look her name up she did great though the guy always trying to get some got a bit tedious but i guess that was more <UNK> humor br br there was just so much to like about the movie lighthearted fun very well done and i am saying that as a movie fan not a <UNK> and i am not a d d player as i said i expected so much less br br movies often don't hold my attention i end up listening to them while working on my computer this one held my attention i can't give a movie much higher praise
<START> got this off of <UNK> so i wasn't prepared for the heavy and i do mean exceptionally heavy religious theme not that i'm one of <UNK> <UNK> or anything but it was very heavy handed br br on top of that the acting <UNK> it might be because they had to get good little boys to play bad little boys but it didn't work br br there was some pretty cool filmmaking involved so any fan of directorial style might want to check it out but be ready with the fast forward buttons br br there was some <UNK> to the editing in particular a black <UNK> probably a representation of satan <UNK> off against a white <UNK> spin camera changes and know that white is into a white <UNK> br br i gave up early on so i can't <UNK> for the moral impact of it but i would like to point out that this sort of film is totally preaching to the choir if the director writer producer was trying to bring religion to the <UNK> masses they went about it all wrong i think i'd rather watch an adult <UNK> commercial than listen to a <UNK> <UNK> bible <UNK> rant about <UNK> dying for us yawn br br
<START> along with virtually every republic picture ever made murder in the music hall seems to have faded into oblivion a shame because this <UNK> produced expertly directed and written and <UNK> mystery suspense item <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> thriller against the setting of radio city music hall a murder in one of the <UNK> posh <UNK> apartments casts suspicion on the <UNK> among them vera <UNK> who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and provides a few dazzling ice <UNK> production numbers helen walker ann <UNK> julie bishop and several other <UNK> b movie <UNK> of the <UNK> tall blond and handsome william marshall usually cast in musicals <UNK> down the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds against the <UNK> settings you'll ever see in a film noir the ending is as much of a surprise as is this sadly forgotten classy murder mystery well worth <UNK> and <UNK> on cable tv vhs or dvd republic <UNK> a <UNK> budget in this grade a production and murder in the music hall is as slick unnerving and immensely enjoyable as any of the major <UNK> films of its era possible spoiler pay attention to the song composed by the victim just before his death then amidst the <UNK> <UNK> in their dressing rooms try to <UNK> the one <UNK> that fatal melody you'll discover who the killer is just as william marshall does grand fun the kind of movie they truly don't make anymore and what a loss both to movie goers and actors alike
<START> i've read many <UNK> comments regarding this film and the only things i have seen that they all have in common are boring and unrealistic br br first of all they used real <UNK> <UNK> how much more realistic can you get no cgi no <UNK> no <UNK> just a croc and a piece of meat have fun <UNK> br br there is no question that this film gets off to a slow start character development what little they had anyway does take a bit of time and i think this is primarily where this film lacks br br however when the film gets going i found the action picked up dramatically i don't mean to say that there is a lot of action if anything there are more moments where the croc can't be seen at all and the people are just waiting however we know that there isn't going to be any relief and that the croc is just <UNK> its time this had a similar eerie feel to other films that achieve their horror through non action such as open water another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being boring personally i think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention <UNK> <UNK> removed at birth but that's just me br br finally the characters feel real and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances furthermore the deaths are completely real and at times it's a little tough to watch br br all in all this one's a winner
<START> i finally got hold of a dvd copy of this production and was with curiosity since i had read so many people <UNK> it to the <UNK> particularly angela <UNK> portrayal of mrs <UNK> i saw the tim burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways for it to be in the least satisfying to me br br to begin with the casting george is adequate and at least shows some expression as opposed to johnny <UNK> <UNK> wooden face in the movie angela lansbury is quite simply annoying at least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to helena bonham <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> little girl's voice but subtlety seems to be only a word in the <UNK> to ms lansbury one cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time <UNK> and <UNK> in a look ma i'm acting fashion and being far too aware of the audience this is not something that is typical of stage productions heaven knows i have been a regular of many productions at the for many years and stage actors do not behave in that fashion as a rule at least those who want to continue to find regular <UNK> do not br br <UNK> <UNK> oh dear oh dear oh dear did anybody besides me notice that she can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately and her playing george daughter is just creepy considering that she was married to him at the time isn't she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen year old yes i realize that this is what acting is all about but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirty five and the phrase <UNK> dressed as <UNK> seems to have been <UNK> just for her her <UNK> of green <UNK> and bird had me <UNK> my teeth and ready to turn off the dvd player at once that song was done so well in tim <UNK> movie and this was a sad shock the song requires the vocal range of julie andrews in the 1960's and a <UNK> of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano any <UNK> at all kills it dead and ms <UNK> spent the entire time <UNK> so hard that i thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was <UNK> so much from the effort at <UNK> notes with a voice that is a <UNK> at best let us pass over the spectacle of her <UNK> at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes this is quite simply not a role and perhaps a <UNK> director should have told her that but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director's hands br br <UNK> was adequate but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and ms <UNK> which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat i am reminded a little of past stage productions of <UNK> ring cycle where due to the vocal power required for the singers to <UNK> over the sound of a full <UNK> orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to <UNK> <UNK> as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice which is why you have the caricature of the massive <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a triple <UNK> and a beard when the <UNK> calls for an <UNK> beauty who is <UNK> young and <UNK> the casting of the juvenile leads is exactly like that if you close your eyes you can almost believe in mr anthony but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is <UNK> and at no time can you ever believe in ms <UNK> for me the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast i cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production i really can't understand why people rave about this badly shot and self conscious filming of a stage play surely there's more to camera work in the theatre than just a camera down in the front row if i want that i'll go to a decent play preferably at the festival where at least they work together for the production and aren't constantly <UNK> for the camera i give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of lansbury and <UNK> seems adequate if not spectacular br br probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play and then combine the two to make a bearable whole that's what i'm going to do and try to forget that i ever bothered to rent this wholly <UNK> production
<START> the third film based on charles play entitled mystery of the wax museum 1933 targets generation x twin screenwriters <UNK> hayes and carey w hayes spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies a promising start their condition <UNK> an authentic point of view the role of <UNK> paris hilton was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite <UNK> she in style <UNK> boys <UNK> on a cell and <UNK> over an ill conceived <UNK> her regular routine has been altered beyond <UNK> hilton reached the peak of her performance not so hot during the 1 night in paris 2004 parody while the <UNK> my ride is in motion she looks for lip <UNK> in her <UNK> robert <UNK> lap finally the actress for using the n word on the sex tape director <UNK> <UNK> his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past each <UNK> opposite characteristics back then whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the <UNK> today however the latter does not rule out the former <UNK> <UNK> the luck of the draw <UNK> can hardly consider vincent brian van holt a contemporary <UNK> granted the <UNK> share some similarities such as artistry <UNK> <UNK> and murder yet one small <UNK> between the two makes all the difference vincent is even <UNK> on the inside than he is on the out house of wax pays homage to actor vincent price from the first remake in 1953 the film leaves obvious van <UNK> <UNK> to the imagination of the audience still the choice to split the antagonist in two <UNK> a vibrant twist at the end professor henry vincent price <UNK> receives runner up but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to <UNK> <UNK> in phantom of the opera <UNK> as far as the new <UNK> is concerned the aftermath of <UNK> surgery <UNK> the effect a surgeon should know operating on <UNK> twins <UNK> them physically and psychologically their father needs to call a couple colleagues dr phil to <UNK> and dr <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> despite what the trailers said wax is not forever in fact you can rid yourself of it by burning it
<START> i was completely drawn into the story but i wonder if perhaps i shouldn't have been so sympathetic to the hurt character's plight for respect because when it <UNK> down i really think that <UNK> <UNK> such as barbara <UNK> is the devil or maybe the filmmakers were telling us that we're all <UNK> supporters of fluff news stories
<START> the <UNK> of <UNK> is a fantastic movie it's very true to the original shakespeare play if you saw jeremy <UNK> in <UNK> and liked his performance this is a movie for you if you saw joseph <UNK> in shakespeare in love and you enjoyed his performance this is a movie for you if you saw al pacino in <UNK> <UNK> and liked his performance this is a movie for you it is a very enjoyable movie and if you're studying shakespeare like me this is a great movie to see the only problem with this movie is that you can't let the little ones see it because is has a wee bit of nudity in it but other than that it's a really good movie
<START> a film that deserved theatrical release this made for television movie is a cinematic gem that <UNK> the technique of michael mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images always with mr mann the of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy award winning actor added to the ensemble of cast writer director and cinematographer br br this film is definitely one of my all time favorites while nothing is perfect this film comes very very close br br along with an excellent script great direction and masterful acting by richard <UNK> there is an all star ensemble of character actors at their finest roger <UNK> brian <UNK> ed <UNK> geoffrey lewis richard <UNK> <UNK> william prince burton <UNK> <UNK> richard <UNK> and billy green bush you may not recognize the names but you will recognize every face br br if this comes on tv sit down with popcorn turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score and prepare to be <UNK> for the <UNK> minutes of the film i highly recommend recording it since it is only available on vhs and dvd from holland and the dvd is region 2 <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> origin of the lone ranger it shows who he was and how and why he became the ranger br br legendary bomb the idea was not a bad one <UNK> and introduce the lone ranger for 1980s audiences right off the bat though there were problems the studio ordered <UNK> moore the original ranger to stop appearing anywhere as the lone ranger it led to a nasty little battle that made <UNK> i know of people who refused to see the film because of how moore was treated also they hired the <UNK> <UNK> to play the ranger was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldn't act in fact his whole vocal performance was <UNK> by another actor also his off screen antics public <UNK> and beating people up didn't help matters acting aside the script is dull and slow also the ranger himself doesn't show up until an hour in there were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a pg however i don't think it was that bad br br there are a few very few things done right here the photography was truly beautiful michael horse was excellent as <UNK> christopher lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the lone ranger finally shows up with the william tell <UNK> <UNK> from the soundtrack it's really rousing but all in all this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the lone ranger it's easy to see why this bombed a 4 mostly for the photography
<START> this movie has some of the worst production values and editing i've ever seen there are several instances of actors <UNK> while trying to remember their lines actors walking in front of actors who are talking and one point where the film <UNK> about seven frames not to mention the heroine getting shot in the chest yet she starts <UNK> oh and what about the secret <UNK> that is well lit and right out in the open awful br br the plot is non <UNK> something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the earth and some kind of <UNK> war <UNK> pulls out a hang <UNK> at one point in the film's dumbest moment the dialogue is stupid containing such gems as it is everything and nothing and i can feel it here br br the movie is a mess a confusing insipid mess <UNK> is a bland hero the sword fights are absurd and the plot <UNK> along slowly all in all this is a movie to avoid
<START> a very great movie br br a big love story lots of sword fighting huge battle scenes <UNK> and villains real history br br few in the west know much chinese history <UNK> <UNK> china the country is in fact named after him some are familiar with the <UNK> <UNK> army recently <UNK> this is a historical epic of how he ended the period of <UNK> states and <UNK> china he <UNK> a <UNK> that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the han <UNK> that <UNK> defined chinese civilization ever since br br <UNK> or the king of as he was known before he <UNK> the empire was roughly <UNK> with <UNK> and in the west the parallel roman world <UNK> west and east worlds was achieved without a single <UNK> personality like <UNK> it would not be for another century before the west produced <UNK> the nearest comparable western figure br br <UNK> is shown very <UNK> here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless <UNK> history only records the ruthless <UNK> part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film the famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old <UNK> can be <UNK> li is lovely she is the emotional core of the story it all makes for great movie making
<START> despite a totally misleading advertising campaign this flick turns out to be an <UNK> clichéd sub par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending clue 1 for all considering seeing this turkey sam <UNK> didn't direct it although commercials for the movie play up his involvement in truth he is one of four producers it's too bad that someone as talented as <UNK> has allowed his name to be used in <UNK> with such a poor movie i don't think he would ever have directed something like this that task was left to the <UNK> brothers br br the screenplay for this film seems to have been <UNK> together from numerous other horror films so you'll find absolutely zero original content in the what we get are a scene here and there that was <UNK> straight out of pulse a couple that could have come from the birds one or two from the others etc nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise ending long before it comes br br right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts has nothing to do with this movie in fact everyone can see the ghosts the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them even quite early in the movie i'm sure that <UNK> was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise is entirely absent now you know so don't be fooled perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors it simply isn't there all of the interactions come across as <UNK> stilted coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened anyhow didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots loud noises visual flashes and anything short of a figure jumping out of a closet and yelling boo all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house if there's any message that the delivers it's don't waste your time on this movie
<START> although a made for cable film by hbo it is an enjoyable movie and a fascinating look at the back stabbing and double dealing world of television allowing the viewer to <UNK> behind the scenes of the so called late night talk show wars in the early 90s as jay leno and david <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> position as host of the tonight show kathy bates gives a bravo performance as <UNK> <UNK> manager helen and one can feel empathy for what leno <UNK> endured at the hands of tv executives it is just as <UNK> now considering the recent events involving the failed attempt by abc to replace <UNK> with <UNK> no matter how many times i have seen this film i still find it as much a pleasure to watch as i did when it first aired if this should ever be released on dvd i would certainly add it to my collection
<START> okay maybe it was because i happen to be in china when i saw this movie maybe it was because i finally had something on tv i could understand or at least read the subtitles or maybe it was just funny whatever it was this movie was worth the time br br i had just arrived for my foot and head <UNK> when they gave me the remote so i could watch tv usually i would turn the darn thing off but i stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked br br the plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star if you like iron chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality tv mode then you will love the scenes with food in this movie br br it goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one however the action is mostly slapstick so you don't always have to read the entire <UNK> to get the idea br br the main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor isn't bad to look at either they are both worth watching finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this isn't a bad choice for both br br i don't speak a word of chinese but i was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film for those who do speak chinese maybe it is even better overall i give this an 8 out of 10 and currently i am even looking to find a copy to have while i stay in china and keep for when i come back home it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in and a silly afternoon at the <UNK> <UNK> watching a silly movie
<START> if you are looking for a movie that doesn't take itself seriously than <UNK> is for you i must say before i write anything more that if you have not seen any of the camp kill yourself videos than the movie most likely won't be as funny my advice is to watch a few clips of those videos that <UNK> and his friends made <UNK> does not take itself seriously at all and that was never the purpose throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot which may get annoying but its nothing that is out of control even through all that the plot does stay focused and the story of ryan <UNK> character does unfold quite nicely this plot i have been told is based off a true story for the most part of ryan <UNK> ex girlfriend brandon is by far the best character in the movie he has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh he stole the movie if you ask me overall i love this movie for its simplicity and straight up weirdness its a <UNK> movie people its not going to be normal <UNK> is filled with hilarious quotes that my friends and i constantly used since the first time we saw it i've seen the movie 6 7 times and still find new things every time the soundtrack is just as good everything from kill to new order and some <UNK> just don't go into the movie with high expectations let it all unfold and then judge it for what it is
<START> like steven seagal i also am a big van damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career br br in this flick van damme assumes the role of jack whom is a cop that just moved to new mexico from new orleans to work as part of the border <UNK> haunted by memories of his past it is up to jack to put an end to a group of ex navy <UNK> from <UNK> illegal drugs into the u s that killed his daughter br br overall i found this film to be very good van damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move the action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing unfortunately van damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago regardless the shepherd border control is the 3rd straight solid film that van damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project br br i definitely recommend this movie to a van damme fan or fan of action movies in general the shepherd border control is a great movie not as good as until death but better than the hard <UNK> be sure to give this one a try you will not be disappointed
<START> it is important and only fair to remember that at the time this short was produced a state of war existed between the united states and the empire of japan add to that the enormous ill will that the beginning of the war created as well as the <UNK> death march and other incidents and the only thing surprising about this short and others is that there weren't more of them one other thing my only problem with this short is that it seems to try to be funny but it isn't i'm not sure that anyone connected with it really tried to make the jokes work or even cared it would have been far better if they had done what disney did with education for death and been totally serious but this short gets a bad rap and shouldn't be judged out of context the times were different then and that is an important consideration anyone <UNK> energy trying to save the world from a sixty year old cartoon needs to take a step back as do i <UNK> energy defending that same cartoon this should be available to interested parties even if not in wide <UNK> not a nice cartoon but sometimes life isn't nice recommended
<START> it borrowed scenes from lotr matrix star wars etc the humor is so dry contrived and corny that you can't help but laugh occasionally at its <UNK> and the fact that you are watching it exactly what you'd expect from an hk comedy the average person would enter with an iq of 100 and leave with less than 80 stephen <UNK> is an obvious <UNK> from this movie the humor would have worked better with stephen the <UNK> version of this movie is not as good as the <UNK> original the graphics are poor compared to its hollywood counterparts there is on low quality cg my biggest complaint is its ending the origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the journey to the west that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line despite its many flaws this movie has far more entertainment value than the other movie nicholas <UNK> starred in the promise
<START> normally i would say i loved this movie not for acting although that was ok not for the script which was so so the reason i would have normally loved this movie is for the intense action which starts from the get go and doesn't end until the final credits roll but the problem with this movie and i felt it was a big problem was the horrible cgi it looks like they ran out of money and couldn't complete the the effects shots a lot of the effects look <UNK> they are in their very <UNK> form since it is obvious they didn't have enough money to finish the movie they should not have released it i actual found the effects insulting it seems obvious they didn't care about making a decent end product for the <UNK> if it weren't for that i would give this movie a much higher rating my vote for air panic is a 3 10
<START> the writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes br br example when dave <UNK> his keyboard from the rain i was eagerly <UNK> the funny sounds that were going to come out of it nothing are you kidding me a truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely <UNK> but then work perfectly br br there were at least 10 other similar situations overall small children will enjoy this parents will endure it without too much complaining
<START> i have always liked bill murray in films like lost in translation and the trailer for this film looked really good but the result was very disappointing basically murray plays jack who has recently found out that his father died and he is expected to hear his will he finds out that his father was a clown because he left a large shoe his <UNK> nose and his main inheritance an elephant the only way that jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel <UNK> miles in four days and give him to a safe <UNK> for 30 000 also starring pat <UNK> as <UNK> there are small tiny moments of humour such as a <UNK> front <UNK> forward and murray screaming but overall it's pointless pretty poor
<START> we see thomas edison with a glowing smile on his face trying to <UNK> a 5 ton living being eventually he was successful and so the first animal snuff film is born cleverly disguised as an amazing achievement in technology this is scientific arrogance at it's worst folks it ranks up there with the doctor who decapitated a monkey just to prove that he could keep its severed head alive for 22 minutes br br oh yes there's the absurd excuse that the elephant had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death and that this was a fair and <UNK> execution to all the people who are satisfied with this <UNK> please form a line on my right i'm going to give you all a big collective three stooges slap across the head br br go watch the <UNK> 1993 a movie based on the true story murder trial of a pig in france 500 years later humans are still a bunch of morons i see br br what's next we arrest birds for stealing our arrest <UNK> for assault and <UNK> thomas edison i hope you have a big fat worm <UNK> through your eye <UNK> right now oh wait that would be <UNK> wouldn't it lol
<START> it is very hard to come up with new information about <UNK> jr and this fine movie had very little of it but it was a joy to watch the casting was very good and the script while somewhat like a documentary was also good my only complaint was that it wasn't long enough perhaps a two part movie could have told us more about his pre george days and his relationships with his mother sister and other relatives some of the material in the book american son by richard blow would have enhanced the movie a lot should be <UNK> for producing such an entertaining movie
<START> the most obvious flaw horrible horrible script this movie had a potentially good story but it was ruined with bad dialogue continuity problems things that were never explained <UNK> <UNK> sub plots that went nowhere and just plain stupidity not to mention the awful cliched directing of sandra locke not even two great performances could've saved this movie so it didn't matter that <UNK> and <UNK> arquette give horrific performances the thing is they're better actors than this movie would have you believe the best of the <UNK> arquette <UNK> after hours desperately seeking susan has some fine moments like a great scene in the beginning when she painfully pulls her <UNK> off but gives an overall weak performance by her standards and <UNK> dick when <UNK> fade and the brilliant my so called life is much worse acting with no conviction or emotion what so ever but i won't lay blame on the actors who have been good in other roles the script is awful and the bad direction doesn't help do me a favor avoid this movie
<START> this movie beats everything out there well depends on what you are looking for it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale this movie is in a complete league of its own i don't think any movie could possibly come close to it i am not sure what the director intended to make it as a thriller or a comedy if he did think he was making a thriller then he has by a stroke of luck created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time you have to see it to believe it a matrix terminator a host of other movies rolled into one along with a storyline dating back to 1980's hindi movies with a a mythical snake which can turn into a human br br its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side planning to laugh at the movie i am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10 on the basis of flipping a <UNK> i have decided to give it a 1
<START> what can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster not that much with the average indie style film making this film has the timing all wrong editing is just awful as far as the gangster story it might have been pulled off if the gangsters didn't lack character everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of punch line none of which were funny the usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business <UNK> the best friend with the zany one liners but the main character the gangster that likes to dress up like a girl only his motivation for dressing up like a girl is that he got <UNK> by a woman weird the ending of the movie had to be the nail in the coffin it was anti climatic to say the least i mean i understand how indie filmmakers don't have the equipment for a proper shot out but they might as well been using water guns overall i would say the hype leading up to it red carpet premiere in <UNK> it was a disappointment
<START> i am from romania and for that i apologize if my english is not so good br br i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed i always liked wesley <UNK> movies but this one is terrible i regret that i spent over 3 hours <UNK> this film there are a lot mistakes in the film for example the stadium in the film is not <UNK> the name of the stadium is the name of the soccer team is called not <UNK> the of the stadium is not capable of showing <UNK> images video <UNK> live images etc it's a simple that can only display letters and numbers the <UNK> <UNK> opponents are displayed on the as din probably from who are main rivals in the romanian soccer championship the images from the soccer match are from a match between and <UNK> my favorite team and my only love look it up on the internet and you will see why the police cars in the movie are not properly made there isn't a single dark blue police car in romania they are all white the mistake list can go on and on and on but i will stop here in short terms this movie is horrible it does not worth renting it it does not worth buying a cinema ticket for it it does not worth <UNK> it i honestly feel sorry that wesley snipes played in this movie a previous movie of his 7 seconds also filmed in romania was ok but this is terrible
<START> i am finding that i get less and less excited about disney's sequels to movies yes i do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same but these movies don't even try some examples are <UNK> ii and tarzan and jane if anyone has seen the previews for <UNK> the movie you will see my point but i <UNK> this movie <UNK> my point the animation is sloppy the story lines resemble saturday morning cartoons and not all of the original voices are there i was very disappointed not to hear michael j <UNK> voice it was so <UNK> obvious that the person doing <UNK> voice was trying to sound like fox but didn't come close to <UNK> br br if it says anything my children ages 10 and 6 didn't even sit through the whole movie
<START> although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters br br this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering perhaps the french had been <UNK> for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether br br this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no <UNK> from having watched a film once it's over i loved movies such as <UNK> or <UNK> for a dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious and i really wanted to like this film at every turn
<START> terrific deeply moving crime thriller starring andy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> wan br br from the <UNK> opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion this cat and hardly misses a beat br br johnny to again working with ace composer arthur wong <UNK> another operatic <UNK> that in the face of its <UNK> br br <UNK> images are strong and moving his cutting combined with the extraordinary music <UNK> is <UNK> you are in the hands of a master br br the two sequences in which andy <UNK> hides from the cops on a bus by pretending to <UNK> a <UNK> beauty ruby wong are testament to <UNK> unique directorial skills br br <UNK> <UNK> wan is strong and commanding as the <UNK> cop while andy <UNK> is dynamic as a dying man <UNK> his father's death br br this is superb movie making only mildly <UNK> by some bad english dubbing in one scene with criminal lee
<START> kate is a jaded young woman who has trouble meeting and dating guys throughout the movie you get to meet several of her loser boyfriends and throughout the movie you are subjected to <UNK> cynical negative <UNK> on love and relationships this negative viewpoint is continued throughout and presented as ultimate truth i had a real problem with this why would anyone want to be taught about love life and dating from someone who is obviously so messed up it would work if that was the joke but it is not for the jokes in the movie which are neither funny nor original to work at all you have to believe what kate is saying that all relationships inevitably end up with bad or no sex that the highest level a relationship can <UNK> to is when you are able to fart in front of your partner you get the idea br br there is no movie in recent memory that comes close to <UNK> the stomach as much as love sex why did the filmmakers waste their time on such trash every joke in love sex is something that i have experienced in another movie or in my own life there is nothing original or creative about the story the production or the style it is cynical dumb and pointless mind numbing
<START> i loved this movie from beginning to end i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love <UNK> drawing but my friends were always there for me music was like my <UNK> life support and my drug it changed my life i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say this movie left me speechless to be honest i just saw it on the <UNK> channel i usually hate having satellite but this was a <UNK> of having satellite the <UNK> channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don't do a very good job on <UNK> lines i mean the obvious language <UNK> leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess i almost never got to see this amazing movie good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed well earlier than usual lol i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did i wish i could type this all in <UNK> but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film i give it three thumbs way up br br this movie blew me away
<START> i have just seen a very original film that i would recommend to everyone including the young the restless ' however i guess some of the profanity violence and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for all your children ' anyways before the sand fills up the <UNK> let me tell you the name of the film nurse betty ' <UNK> <UNK> stars as betty she is a kansas waitress who falls under a <UNK> and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera because of this she goes on a journey to los angeles to reunite with her supposed soap opera character lover dr <UNK> to add fuel to the fire she is also being chased by some ruthless one life not to <UNK> who think she has stolen their drugs you could say that is how nurse betty spends the days of her <UNK> throughout the movie this very situation eventually leads her to the set of her beloved soap opera however the only problem is that betty thinks this is all real it is like her mind is in another world ' ok enough i will wipe off my mouth with soap and not mention any more soap names i have already <UNK> my vote for <UNK> as a best actress oscar <UNK> also greg <UNK> performance as dr <UNK> was as good as it gets in his acting biography to sum it up my final <UNK> is that everyone should call in for nurse betty ' excellent
<START> this one's a <UNK> dating from 1949 scene of the crime often plays more like a <UNK> bros movie set in the 1940's and filmed in black and white except that the writer's ear for <UNK> here isn't quite so well tuned maybe this can be seen instead as the <UNK> to oscar <UNK> schlock like road to <UNK> frankly it's a wonder that this film isn't considered a classic by film <UNK> and critics everywhere considering how much it offers in term of overly <UNK> thrills <UNK> in false significance much like the <UNK> of all such fake art films citizen kane or anything by <UNK> br br mgm is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes and i think any story any atmosphere even gritty realism can only benefit from grotesque you could say i'm a <UNK> of the minnelli school but it takes a certain light touch to write mannered tough guy dialogue of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> perhaps to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like careful mr <UNK> or you'll have thirteen fish to <UNK> and no little to catch them with i made most of that up mr <UNK> unfortunately made the cut but believe me the dialogue is just that <UNK> and <UNK> with non <UNK> even the lead <UNK> wife played by <UNK> <UNK> speaks like she has a moon shaped <UNK> under one eye and the christian name <UNK> by the time van johnson turns in his <UNK> with the line i'm sick to death of death and homicide you'll wonder how the writer's <UNK> with <UNK> literary devices in this case could ever have been <UNK> as street br br for those who have <UNK> the naked gun series this is the funniest cops n robbers film going
<START> i read angels and demons about 3 years ago and i can honestly say to is one of the few books that i couldn't put down while reading br br the movie however was pretty much what i expected a lot of action with somewhat of a mystery storyline tom hanks plays in my opinion a much better role of professor <UNK> than in the da <UNK> code br br you won't have to worry about this being as bad as the da <UNK> code this is everything that it wasn't much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the <UNK> controversy if you haven't read the book no <UNK> you will still find it very interesting and if you have read the book well lets say you might be a little let down because i found many scenes missing that i was looking forward to br br overall pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer but maybe not something too special for dan brown fans
<START> this is one of the most cerebral insightful movies i have ever seen the script language costumes scenery plot characters etc all are supreme you will not be bored i have watched intensely or even just listened to this movie while working so many times i have lost count scarlett ages <UNK> <UNK> wisdom beyond her years in the end this movie takes you from tara to ireland where her family is originally from and you see the results of another civil war played out there this time between the irish and english br br this movie depicts the double standards of men at the time a man is still respected if he has girlfriends and <UNK> but not a woman if she is merely seen in a private place with a man society <UNK> her of <UNK> and of course scarlett was always thinking outside the box breaking rules when necessary to create needed change help people and or survive br br <UNK> beauty definitely is to the bone her strength self <UNK> and wisdom grow as she ages br br i remember her lines when i am confronted with too much on my plate such as tomorrow is another day and the way she carried herself her determination and courage and have learned from her experiences this is a good movie to show your daughters as it teaches a woman how important it is to have respect for yourself and that men especially very handsome ones can have two sides and may treat a woman differently depending on how she acts and respects herself an attractive woman needs to learn what this movie teaches br br this movie is like therapy to me and it is better than gone with the wind the second part takes place in ireland and anyone who is of irish decent will <UNK> the scenery people and <UNK> character within it
<START> the wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture it is a <UNK> to what filmmaking once was but is no more br br connery despite the thick scottish <UNK> plays the very well he <UNK> the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot br br <UNK> <UNK> in one of her early roles is marvelous as the kidnapped <UNK> mrs showing courage in the face of <UNK> and plenty of humour as well a marvelous film rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed

<START> this is indeed the film that <UNK> kung fu in the 1970s however if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot it doesn't seem to have aged very well br br long story short extremely drawn out slow moving confusing plot with run of the mill choreography typically annoying and exaggerated <UNK> sounds with every punch and kick and constant plot twists that never come to an end by the time the film reaches its emotional climax i had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care br br watch it for its historical value as a <UNK> of chinese kung fu cinema just leave your expectations at the door or you'll be <UNK> disappointed br br for hardcore fans only
<START> a group of evil <UNK> need to knock down a building to build a huge complex but they can't remove the <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> with their hired thugs clash until the film ends with one of the funniest fights ever the guy with the ginger hair who goes every time he throws a punch and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting only to be beaten off camera make this essential viewing if you like to laugh at films rather than with them
<START> this guy is a real piece of work an angry immature boy in a grown man's body <UNK> all the charisma of a rock he goes around to places most people would only wish to visit and does his best to be as miserable as possible br br give this job to someone else who actually <UNK> it br br i could go down an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his episodes though i'll just highlight the worst <UNK> while the locals are putting up <UNK> <UNK> in his honour this clown has the <UNK> to act like a <UNK> spoiled child he complains about everything including the fashion sense of the people who live there what an <UNK> br br when he went to sweden he spent at least five minutes <UNK> <UNK> at a bunch of <UNK> who probably had better things to do than talk with some <UNK> american like work because they didn't think <UNK> was horrible everywhere he went he brought up <UNK> this is the kind of talk you'd hear from 13 year olds who watch too much mtv br br when he was in new orleans he got upset that a certain restaurant had better <UNK> <UNK> than his so he accidentally <UNK> some wine on them in order to ruin them what a strange emotionally unstable person br br the worst of it all are his clumsy voice overs where he attempts in vain to add some kind of perspective on a situation he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate he tries to use all these big words in order to sound like an author but he's really just a pretentious hack whose lack of awareness has convinced him he has something to say that by the way is probably the one good thing about this <UNK> tv show it goes to show you no matter how inept you are as long as you take yourself seriously enough the world will as well br br then there's the way he speaks with local <UNK> whose english is obviously only <UNK> he'll use <UNK> any writer as he believes himself to be would <UNK> know will most likely not be understood by these people does he care no self important <UNK> like this clown do not use language to communicate they use it to make themselves look important br br review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind <UNK> that of a low iq social <UNK> observe how the reviewer attempts to justify <UNK> nature with simple minded childish excuses that hardly make sense may complain but he goes through 'a <UNK> and not only that he was to do this show but is trying to redeem himself a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and reading review should let you know perfectly well whether or not you are the kind of person who'd enjoy this utterly useless pointless show br br finally to add a bit of fairness to my <UNK> i admit would have been <UNK> amusing had i met him in a bar but as a tv host of a travel show whose purpose is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures is a miserable <UNK> hopeless grim and depressing failure br br a failure
<START> this film had a lot of potential it's a great story and has the potential to be very creepy but of course tim burton doesn't really do creepy films he does wacky cartoonish films and i usually like tim <UNK> stuff but i thought this film was really weak the best thing about the film and it is actually worth seeing just for this was the art direction the film has an amazing <UNK> quality to it the script was not good it was boring in parts and confusing in other parts and there was no building of characters i never really cared that people were having their heads <UNK> off by a <UNK> being i thought johnny <UNK> had a good thing going with his approach to the character but given that the script was weak he couldn't go too far with it and i was very irritated by the attempts at a slight accent on his and christina <UNK> parts br br anyway it is sadly not a great film and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction
<START> ah here it is a movie which is said by people to remind me of the epic <UNK> <UNK> was i a fool to believe that and <UNK> how my <UNK> hurt after having forced myself to watch this c p from beginning to end after the first 10 15 minutes i just wanted it all to end or at least they could've put some nudity or action or cool acid house music into it to make it worth the time but no when i was through with it i put it into my cd shelf and i hope i will never have to pick it out again just to show it to some friend who is so anxious to see it that he she don't want to listen to my <UNK>
<START> i realize a period piece is expensive to make and that this style of shooting close framed shots to camera moving camera wide <UNK> shots washed out allows such films to be made for a price as a style it has <UNK> and <UNK> like any other it allows more period pieces to be made like any style it has its <UNK> and supporters there are probably even those that believe that this manner of shooting has an artistic basis br br if only some of the money saved could have been spent on the script for whatever style is used a film needs good writing and good acting br br the acting in this film is mostly very good the writing less so it is composed of a collection of bits taken from the book and much which is relevant to the plot is left out making for a disjointed collection of scenes with little or no continuity br br if you have read the book do not under any circumstances watch it if you have not read the book are easily pleased and have nothing better to do there is no harm in watching it but be prepared to be disappointed br br it could have been so much better
<START> lucio <UNK> don't torture a <UNK> paints an exceptionally <UNK> portrait of small town <UNK> plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys this surprisingly well directed film especially in comparison to later <UNK> <UNK> is distinguished by overall atmosphere of <UNK> <UNK> and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence the soon to be dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding <UNK> <UNK> near seduction by the naked <UNK> barbara <UNK> really has to be seen to be believed highly recommended especially in pair with my another cult favourite house with the windows that laugh 1976
<START> this story about a man's 28 year struggle for a death that would <UNK> him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to be remembered thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace directed written edited and scored by <UNK> <UNK> it touches you from the very first images and doesn't leave your eyes and your heart to rest until the last credits thanks to <UNK> and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best <UNK> is an acting animal one of those few comedians that can make a masterpiece from almost any character the supporting actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such a sensibility that one laughs and cries in the same minute as we used to do with the great old masterpieces the year's best film in all senses 10 10
<START> a labor of love each frame is picture perfect and grabs you then the sheer emotion and story telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie the director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry you are a part of the emotional ride of the characters i have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing at every showing the remarkable story telling <UNK> <UNK> and language and i felt i was a part of the drama unfolding before me the casting is as perfect as one can get <UNK> <UNK> and benoit each hold their own br br i strongly recommend this film to everyone who <UNK> good cinema i can't wait for the commercial release of this movie
<START> when i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to rent it believing <UNK> that it was one of those so bad it's fun movies and that i was in for a treat i was wrong br br for starters the pace is <UNK> mind numbingly slow the pace doesn't even begin to pick up until the last 15 20 minutes of the movie the plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in <UNK> but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwise br br try child's play instead
<START> i've always loved horror flicks from some of the usual well known like the exorcist to some of the more underrated like black christmas or just before dawn but who are people kidding even calling this trash a b movie it's straight up bottom of the barrel z grade the acting is the worst ever on film really i've seen better on an episode of the young and the restless spoiler <UNK> for when the woman comes to tell them about the legend of jack o she pauses sometimes for a matter of seconds as if someone is flashing her cue cards and she's struggling to read her lines a riot br br oh and besides the bad acting absolutely no gore or f x and jack o looked like a plastic lit <UNK> watch <UNK> <UNK> in night of the demons or silent night deadly night far superior flicks
<START> ok where to start i can't believe how many good reviews i read on here i watched this year 2004 and i had to fight to not push the stop button i decided to continue just because of all the good reviews i read after watching it i felt it was my duty to let the world know about this first of all the movie seems like it is never going to begin the <UNK> doesn't actually occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends leaving the viewer wondering when is this going to so don't ever call this a revenge <UNK> because the revenge doesn't even start until over half the movie is already gone by furthermore the movie tries to make you believe this is a post apocalyptic australia i am sorry if showing dusty rural roads half the movie and a crooked letter on a sign didn't quite convince me of that even for 1979 this was not science fiction so anyways add this on top of randomly placed <UNK> subtext and you have got yourself one crappy movie i have nothing against gays there was just no need for it the only good part was the first chase scene good directing considering it was 1979 and another good part is how he kills the last guy so basically i recommend you watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and you will enjoy yourself much more than if you sat through all that stuff in the middle which may lead you to <UNK> your own eyes out don't say i didn't warn you
<START> i saw this movie last night at the film festival it was an interesting and funny movie that had some endearing and moving scenes peter falk was excellent as was the rest of cast they were believable and played their roles well the movie may have gone a bit long and the conclusion was okay the audience laughed at the right places the family dynamics were terrific and though this was a jewish family they could have been italian irish or any other including greek i recommend this film if you are interested in laughing at a subject that isn't often handled that way makes you think about the of your actions and how they affect others in your life and those who are not clearly in your life
<START> this show is just plain awful i liked to watch drake and josh which was great and before that the amanda show also funny but this is just awful in my opinion watching this felt like watching those movies from painful and this is about 3 dumb kids who make a crappy web show while stealing the hole while their retarded brother is making <UNK> he has no life the cast is crap <UNK> from drake and josh is <UNK> <UNK> a ugly b <UNK> is sam and some kid they pulled off the street plays fred all i saw from this are random jokes that include the brother making a clay film he also played an <UNK> game called rat <UNK> sam and <UNK> being <UNK> on their web show and fred being a <UNK> the only episode a saw cant remember the title where fred gets bad luck by not an email i find videos on youtube funnier than this junk and why the hell do they get youtube jack fred get to <UNK> the show with his <UNK> mouth just skip this show
<START> every once in a while an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can't miss but the movie sucks some recent films <UNK> to this unfortunate category are <UNK> and the safety of objects and now here's the united states of <UNK> br br said awesome cast includes ryan <UNK> kevin spacey don cheadle <UNK> malone lena <UNK> michelle williams chris <UNK> and <UNK> washington <UNK> plays <UNK> p fitzgerald the teenage son of a famous author spacey who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime murdering a retarded child but doesn't remember it and doesn't seem to have any sort of motive br br don cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand <UNK> and also exploit him by writing a book about him and <UNK> malone is his ex girlfriend we see their <UNK> relationship due to her heroin addiction in flashback sounds like an awesome little drama huh i thought so too br br the fact is that this movie is just badly badly written the dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating <UNK> about life the characters are all two dimensional indie cliches and while it does manage to make <UNK> sympathetic in some ways it <UNK> over his crime br br for the most part there's no problem with the acting <UNK> who was oscar worthy in the believer is a tremendously talented young actor but the way they're written none of these characters least of all <UNK> even feel like real people so there's not much he can do but <UNK> his ridiculous lines and look sad br br <UNK> malone is the most memorable she has one of the most <UNK> faces i've ever seen even playing an <UNK> character in a bad movie like this she can break your heart with one look when she's got good material to work with as in <UNK> <UNK> or the dangerous lives of <UNK> boys she's really amazing br br but this is not good material maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile but as it is the united states of <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and for a movie that seems in love with how deep it is it's really shallow
<START> who in india is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film making has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good without offering much food for thought forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art br br while i would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative <UNK> plots does not contain lingering effects afterward and mostly contain ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama seen <UNK> in indian movies br br overall has successfully confirmed my <UNK> for his films once again br br sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise my suggestion to you watch some beautiful cinemas made around the globe
<START> the story in this movie is fairly implausible b grade stuff but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead and in 1940 that meant peter lorre and peter is at his <UNK> in this one as island owner stephen who gets prisoners <UNK> to his custody to work at his island diamond mine upon arrival the discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the <UNK> of br br only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves wife and monkeys monkeys <UNK> him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get br br lorre is perfect in his role here and creeps up the screen in industrial strength fashion although the script is not casablanca caliber the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes this is a very watchable story but i'm not sure what <UNK> this movie filled too long for a short subject and too short for a feature length film i'm not sure how this was <UNK> to theaters br br i just caught this for the first time on a late night early morning tcm showing lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it
<START> i love to see a female protagonist in this movie her name was rose rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of <UNK> is is possible to <UNK> peace and internal <UNK> through <UNK> means does our society teach this can one be a victim of memory which may lead to <UNK> others is one responsible for being a product of one's environment to what extent can one control or take control of one's environment how is a typical human alike or different than rose lastly would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like france or italy i loved that this movie <UNK> all of these questions in me while it entertained <UNK> and kept me guessing to the end every time i've watched it i have learned more about the film and myself
<START> i have seen this movie when it was released and no doubt it is heart touching i liked the point of view of a kid who came to know that what she was thinking about her were actually not true it's a <UNK> to that small kid and her search to find out who she is and before and after she knows about her the relationship between her and her foster mom that's a nice view a r <UNK> adds his stress by a good re recording and songs in this movie <UNK> does not <UNK> or give <UNK> like in but simply <UNK> the characters as they are and because of that the film exactly strikes the audience the pool bath scene of and did not convey perfectly what it meant for <UNK> has amazingly improved
<START> 2001 is one of those movies where if you don't like it you are told that you don't <UNK> <UNK> and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism you're told that you clearly have a slow attention span and just want to see sex explosions and have the plot handed to you on a <UNK> br br let's break down the movie shall we three minutes of <UNK> with something that sounds like a dying <UNK> in the background then we get the opening credits a minute of fascinating shots of the <UNK> then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones cut to the first of many 20 minute shots of ships doing things while the <UNK> <UNK> plays in the background a bunch of pointless dialogue and a group of moon scientists find another <UNK> br br cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew <UNK> three sleeping people two people named dave and frank who have only slightly more personality than the <UNK> in <UNK> and then there's hal the <UNK> <UNK> who runs the ship predictably he <UNK> and starts breaking the first law of <UNK> now this is something that has potential an evil <UNK> ruthless super mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move and what does he do he lets one guy <UNK> into space and turns off the <UNK> machines so the three sleeping guys die leaving dave floating in a <UNK> he simply uses the <UNK> puts on a <UNK> and turns hal off <UNK> slowly then apparently there's some psychedelic at <UNK> br br here's the movie with the pauses taken out apes see <UNK> kill things scientists find moon <UNK> hal kills people hal dies dave gets a message and <UNK> at <UNK> br br this is not me <UNK> getting it ' this is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing sure it's realistic but i find i have no reason to care no matter the message no movie can be good without being entertaining frankly every character could be replaced with keanu reeves and nothing would change
<START> i couldn't believe how bad this film was and trust me i was not expecting a masterpiece from a made for cable film i taped it just because i liked jane seymour i've seen her enough to know that she is certainly an accomplished actress so i just don't know what happened here the characters were shallow the dialog stilted the acting bad and yes that includes seymour it was nice seeing her play against type but not in something this bad i noticed that she carried a credit for executive producer so she cannot escape blame for the sheer badness of this film and oh yeah they had barry <UNK> playing the male lead <UNK> said
<START> this is just one of those movies that continually make you <UNK> and that i wished was over the problems are many and the good points are few i feel the main problem with this movie is that it has what amounts to a cheesy plot and they try to make it out to be a epic movie which a movie about super evil monkeys and smart ones that sign just is not epic it is cheese when you have cheese you make the movie more fun granted the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and more of things of that nature was needed instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the movie just has a corny plot amid all the serious tension the movie is trying to set up the plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex husband while also searching for some sort of legendary <UNK> she uses these two guys who trained an ape to do sign language and now wish to return her to the wild as cover to get into the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime the only things that make this movie somewhat tolerable is ernie <UNK> character and the laser attack at the end
<START> possible spoilers as peter jackson has so brilliantly shown in his lord of the <UNK> trilogy it is quite possible to make good films even great ones within the heroic fantasy genre the genre has distinguished literary <UNK> dating back to the <UNK> romances particularly the <UNK> legends upon which <UNK> and other authors have drawn lord of the <UNK> apart however it is difficult to think of any other sword and <UNK> films which are any good i would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was ron <UNK> and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one red however cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one br br as with many of the plot elements in red are derived from the lord of the <UNK> an evil <UNK> seeks to gain control of an <UNK> with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world <UNK> but is <UNK> by an <UNK> group of heroes the film set in the age a <UNK> era in the <UNK> remote past starts with the villain of the piece the wicked queen making <UNK> sexual advances to the heroine <UNK> when these are <UNK> not a woman to take no for an answer <UNK> by murdering <UNK> parents and brother in 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her <UNK> frustrated lesbian lust br br next move is to capture the <UNK> a sort of <UNK> green soccer ball with magical powers by <UNK> the whole of the scantily dressed female <UNK> charged with protecting it just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous among the dead is <UNK> sister her sole surviving relative <UNK> herself however has not been <UNK> but has <UNK> in a martial arts academy from which she <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and sets out to avenge herself along the way she teams up with a heroic wandering <UNK> king resembling <UNK> <UNK> prince the <UNK> child <UNK> of a kingdom that has fallen to powers and loyal servant the rest of the film is fairly predictable as <UNK> and her allies try to <UNK> and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out of control <UNK> br br just what is it that makes this film so bad well the acting for a start arnold <UNK> as gives the sort of typical wooden poker faced performance that became his trademark at least in the early part of his career complete with heavy foreign accent compared with <UNK> <UNK> as the heroine however he looks like laurence olivier miss <UNK> seems to have had even worse language difficulties delivering every line in the mechanical voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a teach yourself english by course one wonders if she was hired for the role just to make arnie look good by comparison the other characters while not <UNK> their own private struggles against the english language are simply cartoonish caricatures especially prince who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever br br an even worse fault than the bad acting however is the film's almost complete lack of imagination this is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to <UNK> the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be <UNK> by a fantastic plot when we watch peter jackson's masterpiece we can <UNK> ourselves at least for the next three hours that we are in middle earth that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> do exist and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring when we watch red we are <UNK> of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a <UNK> for possession of a <UNK> green football br br this lack of imagination even starts with the film's title the british science fiction author brian <UNK> when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters <UNK> that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero joe admittedly <UNK> was able br br to get away with giving the name sam to one of his main characters but that was because <UNK> were supposed to be <UNK> familiar the middle earth equivalent of <UNK> <UNK> smoking <UNK> similarly giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long gone <UNK> age a common girls' name like which is how the name is <UNK> is about as appropriate as calling her <UNK> or mary <UNK> br br the film seems to have been made on a very small budget which makes me wonder why they bothered at all fantasy needs to be done convincingly or not at all it was obviously shot in a remote mountain area with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture the few buildings we see such as the temple of the <UNK> or palace are obviously cheap sets we learn that capital city has been destroyed by using the power of the <UNK> but we do not actually see this event all we see is what might be a <UNK> taking place on the other side of a hill at first you wonder how <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> an entire kingdom with only a few allies but when you see how small an army has at her <UNK> it becomes more understandable when an <UNK> threatens to destroy the palace you wonder if this is the <UNK> at work or merely a crew member inadvertently <UNK> against the set if we can enjoy this film for nothing else we can at least enjoy it for its <UNK> humour a fine example of the so bad it's funny school of filmmaking ed wood would have been proud of this one if it had been shown on <UNK> television the night before the recall election gray davis would still be <UNK> 2 10
<START> i just realized why the colors and sets in were so flashy and <UNK> and just painful to look at the story is about a high class prostitute known as an <UNK> in japanese their <UNK> were always <UNK> and <UNK> than other <UNK> so that the <UNK> would stand out but the director had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character or even the story br br what anna did in the movie just gave me the creeps you couldn't call it acting it was nothing more than <UNK> to her <UNK> out high school girl fan base hey anna good luck on that one as you get older yeah right an <UNK> as a crude and vulgar prone to violence biker chick didn't we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate movie br br the story was painfully boring and predictable what is the story of an obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that an obnoxious bitch she finds that inexplicably men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful high class prostitute even though she talks and behaves like she's a member of a female biker gang this so called seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action probably due to the <UNK> of the main pretend phony biker chick i mean actress br br the main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more <UNK> <UNK> not very <UNK> like is it how could such a woman ever become an <UNK> oh because the previous <UNK> got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap rumors get around how could there be no <UNK> for what she did to the powerful guy because the screenwriters are <UNK> they just made up a bunch of crap br br then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her why and she throws him over for a <UNK> guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is which doesn't make sense how can anyone respect someone so worthless br br speaking of crap it's like the director down and took a huge psychedelic colored dump on the <UNK> culture and society of the <UNK> period what of such things as <UNK> no aware subtlety <UNK> a <UNK> society all <UNK> upon by a director who comes off as a senseless <UNK> the amazing thing is that so many other japanese in watching this movie down around the director and took steaming <UNK> of this blazing colored <UNK> crap and <UNK> how tasty it was br br <UNK> tango music with <UNK> and as backdrop for the <UNK> period when japan was totally isolated from the international world except for the 3 7 <UNK> of why not just have anna the bad ass biker <UNK> answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful character drive off in a <UNK> fit in his red <UNK> the music we had to listen to was jarring and <UNK> the same as the art design br br near the ending i liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the <UNK> <UNK> tree but earlier the second she said she would leave the quarters when it <UNK> we all knew exactly what would happen how boring to <UNK> the ending so clearly but what's the point of the old tree <UNK> that rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in <UNK> <UNK> like the mountains of in spring that didn't impress her at all no of course not i already know that about <UNK> the guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls maybe it bugs the <UNK> to have people them when they themselves know the truth of who they are just cheap and worthless br br considering the director's obsession with <UNK> the second to last scene should have been of a <UNK> bowl on a <UNK> accidentally knocked over two fish <UNK> into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters <UNK> how <UNK> are stuck in their bowl and can't survive outside just like the <UNK> relationship with the pleasure quarters otherwise the talk of the fate of <UNK> has no meaning br br in the final scene the <UNK> trees were full in bloom but the <UNK> of the <UNK> is one thing special about <UNK> <UNK> i couldn't help thinking that soon enough <UNK> would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth from the scene the sky would go quickly from hints of shadow into an ever <UNK> <UNK> and night would fall it would become cold very cold and dark that really wasn't a happy ending was it romantic love in the <UNK> period could survive in the face of terrible poverty and being <UNK> for about as long as those <UNK> trees <UNK> maybe a few days unless it sooner but the romantic love we see here it's existence in this period is incomprehensible br br anna walking in the shoes of an <UNK> she couldn't do it literally check out the scene of her <UNK> where she seems to have the correct <UNK> on but she has to hold on to some guy's shoulder to keep from <UNK> on her ass br br i was going to give this movie two stars for the art direction but then i realized what that was all about sick <UNK> on the part of the director those colors and sets are just the way the director has of screaming i'm the most important one here me it's all about me
<START> i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did the anthology stories were better than par but the <UNK> story and its surprise ending hooked me alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself where i have i seen them before forget the running time listed on new <UNK> tape this ain't no <UNK> minutes according to my vcr <UNK> and imdb space <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> in his own special way and <UNK> this an 8
<START> from all the bad comments about this movie and add them up i feel the same way it may look like the <UNK> are <UNK> instead they were brave soldiers in this film it was very terrible and too graphic i didn't see enough <UNK> just more <UNK> which is <UNK> because its nothing from what i read we don't need the <UNK> of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through it's like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier for example mel gibson is a over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical <UNK> letters of <UNK> <UNK> was one of the war films that was close enough to history although i could be wrong except <UNK> of our fathers and bridge of the river <UNK> you're better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you don't tell it right and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough <UNK> from the <UNK> to kill japanese soldiers just read history on the internet <UNK> and in books movies always kill the sense of realization what they did to <UNK> in <UNK> and the <UNK> was just dreadful to civilians it just makes me feel proud to see <UNK> beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it
<START> <UNK> blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy the film clearly supports it takes a village to raise a child and reminds of an important time in black history and culture i gained an incredible amount of respect for macy gray as an actress her character was a little crazy yet lovable clearly we all have known someone like <UNK> character s is absolutely fantastic as <UNK> i never realized that was such a great actress law order never <UNK> the depth of acting abilities like <UNK> blues i was pleasantly surprised and amazed the music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood it was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane i truly enjoyed the film and eagerly <UNK> the dvd release to add to my collection
<START> the premise of bottom crossed with <UNK> towers sounds great however have managed to create a film that raises barely a <UNK> ten years ago <UNK> mad stare and idiocy were funny now they are just annoying br br the film had promise though the most horrendous hotel in britain is not a new idea but failed to deliver the saving <UNK> were competent performances from simon <UNK> big train pegg and mathieu and the film is only 90 minutes long sorry guys but you really have hit the bottom
<START> clearly <UNK> after the first gangster movies that warner produced the same year little <UNK> 1931 and the public enemy 1931 this gangster movie is one of the better efforts i've seen although not quite in the same league as the previous mentioned classics it has a powerful performance by young sylvia sidney she's magnificent and delivers her lines more natural than perhaps anyone did at the time gary cooper is better than usual at this stage in his career and shows signs of what would follow the next few years when he rose to the top the movie has some fascinating villains in paul lukas never seen him this <UNK> and guy <UNK> what a shock to see him act the <UNK> the direction of <UNK> is very inventive probably the first voice over to show a persons thoughts appear in this movie if you get the chance to see this little gangster flick don't let the chance go by
<START> i won't waste your time by describing the plot for this the other reviewer already did this quite well i will however give you my opinion of this movie this movie is basically anti japanese the japanese are portrayed as evil b <UNK> who have respect for nothing as well as having very poor martial arts skills groups of japanese men get there <UNK> kicked by single women on more than one occasion the fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every if not every fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense the plot is actually quite solid and perfect for a kung fu movie though the problem lies in the fact that there's not much fighting when there are fights some of the fighting is quite good but other scenes are choreographed badly one scene angela <UNK> takes on six japanese in a church and kicks all their <UNK> the problem is they show her fighting them one by one when they're all supposed to be attacking at the same time i gather this movie was cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are they use the same village set for when they are in korea and when they are in china without changing it at all some scenes are filmed at real locations though and they look good overall the only real problem with the movie is it's slow moving and uninteresting plot since there are few fight scenes we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and well i wasn't entertained br br one and a half stars out of four
<START> i enjoyed this film immensely due to <UNK> scenes humorous as well as ironic some even <UNK> believable performances witty dialogue and a heartfelt rendering of what it´s like or rather c a n be like to be <UNK> and or homosexual on the <UNK> for <UNK> of your desires <UNK> aware of the <UNK> here <UNK> a n d this is something the film <UNK> on end but never uses for caricature if <UNK> as open minded as the people seem to have been who made that film in the end it <UNK> matter to you if those who lie in each others arms are of the same sex or not br br mr smith from the matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay houses salesman with strange <UNK> here but <UNK> not the only thing to marvel at enjoy
<START> seriously i can't imagine how anyone could find a single <UNK> thing to say about this movie much less find it in themselves to write the glowing <UNK> contained in this comment section how many was on during the filming of this movie was he giving a bonus to the actor that <UNK> his lines out with the most speed and least <UNK> or thought the dialogue is bad the plot atrocious even for a screwball comedy and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing i've ever heard the cinematography is below the quality and <UNK> of that <UNK> by the worst made for tv movies the acting is awful although i get the feeling that the fault for that lies <UNK> in the lap of the director and speaking of which did i mention the direction is so <UNK> and <UNK> that it defies the definition of the word the whole thing is a terribly unfunny even in the much <UNK> world of so bad it's funny <UNK> soul sucking waste of two hours of your life that you'll never get back be afraid be very afraid
<START> this film is a fun little private eye detective story like they aren't made any more it's all there tom <UNK> is the suave detective called the <UNK> goldie locke what's in a name is his <UNK> bumbling sidekick <UNK> is the damsel in distress and of course there are the <UNK> maid the professor with the secret formula the bad guy that wants the formula and the police inspector who's after the <UNK> there is a murder and the <UNK> gets <UNK> the scenery is night <UNK> expensive hotel rooms a luxury train the <UNK> and beautiful cars go watch this little gem when you see it pass by on afternoon tv
<START> i finally saw <UNK> and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was <UNK> by it what's great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter the pace in <UNK> and the settings are exotic the film has a lot going for it unfortunately it also has a few things going against it the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al <UNK> have no chemistry whatsoever because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite <UNK> according to imdb al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen br br the other problem with <UNK> is that some sex scenes are just <UNK> or even ridiculous there's one sex scene that stands out as one of the <UNK> i've ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross <UNK> the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in mid air and al <UNK> is filming all of this with his <UNK> camera i kid you not ridiculous we later see that <UNK> footage being edited on a while the footage rolls al and annie start making out this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much watching the footage of the cross <UNK> getting it on with his bimbo while <UNK> the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way the last thing i want to see is a woman <UNK> a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while <UNK> a helicopter no less al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly br br speaking of drag another dull plot point in <UNK> which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great maria and his two wives a married <UNK> is an interesting idea but it hardly <UNK> here as hot or even interesting the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex in fact keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film even when he's with annie belle this is another minor complaint about <UNK> there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era it just needed more skin to punch it up br br except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments <UNK> is actually very watchable i love these kind of <UNK> films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see today br br p s make sure to watch <UNK> in egypt which stars annie al but also another famous screen couple laura <UNK> and <UNK> the music in that movie is also great
<START> where do i begin its one of the most frustrating movies i've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid a movie about a ghost inhabited bed the first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going <UNK> on a from pulp fiction <UNK> contest winner and <UNK> her with his tie this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a <UNK> is the way to do it fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly <UNK> and begins <UNK> their things so far <UNK> normal then one night while doing the on a single <UNK> they realize they need a bed frame this is where things get <UNK> why didn't they bring or buy a g d damn bed frame before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it <UNK> and their <UNK> days are saved or so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the <UNK> images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old <UNK> the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a <UNK> for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the friendly <UNK> murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge while <UNK> up the husband goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female <UNK> his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her br br well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing why the hell didn't they just throw the out the window seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bed so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on that's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit <UNK> but there are more holes in it than sonny <UNK> at a <UNK> booth the couple did try to leave town as to every other movie that has the <UNK> oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going so props to that still though me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes why didn't they just throw the bed out especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something br br all in all its a near watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple you're scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be the highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can't shoot her like that br br 4 out of 10 a low budget porno the man show would love
<START> i'm not sure what it is but there seems to be some curse when it comes to films about the <UNK> bigfoot there has yet to be a film that intelligently approaches the subject nor one that creates any real suspense both legend of <UNK> creek 1972 and the first film entitled sasquatch 1978 have become minor cult classics but neither were very memorable both films were targeted at family friendly audiences thus themselves from actually trying to scare anyone harry the <UNK> 1987 was the first big budgeted film to use bigfoot with a terrific creature design by rick baker however they too chose to aim for younger audiences but this time as a comedy as did bigfoot in 1995 i've long <UNK> for someone to tackle the subject as a thriller perhaps in the vein of jaws or predator when i saw this at my local video store i thought my dream had come true boy was i wrong lance <UNK> plays a <UNK> who leads an expedition into the pacific <UNK> in hopes of finding his daughter as she was on board a small plane when it crashed in the mountains the premise is interesting and sounded promising the truth is it never builds any real suspense i never found myself at all interested in any of the characters as each of them were very two dimensional and rather bland even the always <UNK> <UNK> seems to be <UNK> in his performance every time he appears on screen he looks plain bored he should be as there is no action to speak of for the first hour of the film as for the creature where do i start i figured at the very least we would get a cool looking monster running around in the woods but instead we get this bald yes i said bald man with pitch black skin and <UNK> of fur here and there picture a cross between swamp thing and from land of the lost and you'll get the idea nothing like the artwork on the cover box i assure you sloppy editing and <UNK> direction also adds to the confusion as half the time everything seemed out of sequence while the other half of the film was constantly used up with these long slow fade outs which made no sense or served any purpose they even stole the whole <UNK> red vision p o v from the creature in predator which just looked too silly and out of place to be effective maybe all this proves is that hollywood should just forget about trying to make anymore bigfoot films as they have yet to make one that works so far each one has been as scary as an episode of in search of 3 10
<START> i am continuously amazed at the us networks what is the matter with them yet another very very promising series <UNK> after just 15 episodes and we are left not knowing what the hell happens to everyone i really thoroughly enjoyed this show and am so annoyed that we will never find out what happens to the characters and the <UNK> from the deep this show had everything humour suspense action what more could you want why oh why did the pull the plug on this it just doesn't make sense buffy went on for 7 series as did <UNK> and enjoyable as they were surface invasion and dead like me were even better just because a show does not get terribly high ratings doesn't mean it's rubbish and if they gave it a bit longer probably more people would catch on to it and they would end up with a big hit on their hands one season just does not give it enough time to catch on and the networks are far to eager to pull the plug they should learn that like fine and <UNK> they take time to mature br br bring surface and invasion back p l e a s e
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen bar none from the flimsy looking poorly lit sets to the laughable acting to the <UNK> plot and shoddy drawn out action sequences this film is so bad its hilarious for about ten minutes after which you will be reaching for the remote or the power <UNK> to end this film non experience although it was obviously made with the entire production and acting collective tongue <UNK> in cheek please god i found jack frost 2 so dreadful as to be unwatchable for more than a quarter of an hour if you have not had enough of it after this time you must be <UNK> in drug abuse
<START> five was an interesting viewing experience for me because of the question <UNK> seems to subtly ask the audience three men are the focus of this chapter and <UNK> present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad in one's case almost <UNK> bad with such vile characters i found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment however when the time comes for the murder and it's subsequent effect on the murderer <UNK> takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view are you not as guilty as this man this sort of <UNK> address of the audience makes the finale of five that much more profound as <UNK> as usual doesn't stay within the literal confines of his theme just as the other parts of the don't take their theme in it's literal sense neither does five it asks us what is murder who is more guilty of murder and what should be the appropriate punishment if any it's a fantastic film and typical of <UNK> absolutely stunning
<START> just saw it the story the plot the script makes absolute no sense its the brave part 2 without the ring its characters showing up out of the blue for no reason its <UNK> hated by everyone no one knows why its <UNK> showing her true talents two of them its crappy special effects its a few good actors wasting their talents did i mention two talents do i have to say more its just awful even for nbc tv standards its just the lowest what a waste by the way how can you people give this mini series so many stars its beyond me shame on you have to make 10 lines so this is my final word avoid avoid if u are considering buying it
<START> this is a low budget stop motion monster movie from brett a barbarian in dinosaur hell <UNK> and it delivers just what i'd expect from such a production light hearted though cheesy dialogue some cute actresses and lots of stop motion <UNK> that's why i've given the film 10 out of 10 because it delivers what i expected it to deliver and a bit more brett doesn't penny <UNK> when it comes to putting his <UNK> on screen he <UNK> lots of bugs at his cast for the finale and anyway i love stop motion monsters which compared to cgi <UNK> in bigger budgeted movies just seem to be that much fun to watch
<START> i was pleasantly pleased with the ending i just saw this movie yesterday and was going to turn it off but changed my mind it was not at all the direction i thought the story would end on thats about all positive i can say about this film all of the actors are especially the lead while she is an attractive young woman she'll never make it big the writing direction and acting are <UNK> sort of like what you would see on daytime <UNK> the filming locations were very clever in making you think it could be anywhere instead of blatantly <UNK> off it was in canada as this was shot entirely in canada i'm assuming the entire lot was which is not entirely bad as some recent tv productions cold squad stone are quite well done
<START> i thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it the premise was too silly and predictable i didn't make it far into the movie br br let me see she is obviously older than the <UNK> unless she is a lot younger than she looks he is black and she is white she makes more money than him he is only a <UNK> that's 3 of <UNK> most <UNK> failed <UNK> all rolled up in one and we are supposed to pretend they have a chance in hell she would be better off marrying the guy she doesn't love br br i only watched it partially because i love as an actor his acting was superb hers <UNK> it was ok but the premise is too silly didn't see the end couldn't make it there so i don't know if it ended differently from the way i predicted the ending would be i can't imagine any black woman liking this movie there is something sickening about watching a black man <UNK> to a white woman like that and an old one at that please not in the real world
<START> i haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since star wars episode iii both shows sold out and for good reason the man with the screaming brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of <UNK> hey i'm a <UNK> too br br bruce campbell was present and had the whole crowd in <UNK> the movie was cheesy in the best possible way it may be the funniest movie that bruce has done ted <UNK> steals the show with his <UNK> hip hop and zany facial expressions he is a laugh riot who knew that ted could rap br br i changed my mind the person who stole the show was actually a robot there is nothing funnier than a robot doing the robot br br as for <UNK> performance i take the <UNK> thanks bruce thanks for being cool thanks for taking the time thanks for all of the fun
<START> eve is an eye opener because of the great <UNK> and the tech no music in the backgrounds we hear this movie shows a good aspect on the human body being god's creation and to <UNK> about it viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of adam and eve either if it's true or just a fairy tale depending on what we believe from watching this movie actress model <UNK> <UNK> of eve is so good there's no good word to describe her performance and i can't imagine having another actress being eve this movie to me comes in really handy for the type of therapy of stress relief we'd never fell so relax then before from watching this movie this movie is a masterpiece god supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place br br mr
<START> this is a film that in no way reflects the real world nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic it <UNK> entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this film br br i love the film br br somewhere at the very beginning i bought into the completely unreal premise of the hit woman <UNK> her memory as the past comes back to haunt her there was a moment early on where i remember accepting that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine was going to know nothing until it was needed despite all logic that it wouldn't happen that way oh its one of those films i said to myself and was hooked as the film took off on a wild two hour chase br br this is an action film with brain and <UNK> as things follow there own internal logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns i like this a great deal and am pleasantly surprised when i <UNK> into people who feel the same way too people either love it or hate it if they've ever heard of it at all br br if you like action films this is a film to definitely try you may not like it but it certainly worth the effort to find out br br and as always leave reality at the door
<START> i sort of liked this movie not a good one but not the worst ever made though everyone else says it is one o the worst movies ever created i thought it was okay there are a lot of immature jokes it wants to be funny sometimes but fails br br the story is okay it may be a little hard to follow for the younger audiences though br br the acting is pretty bad jamie kennedy is a horrible actor at most times at some times it is even laughable alan <UNK> is probably the best actor in here he is funny when he is supposed to be but some of his lines are god awful br br oh and the main bad thing about this movie that i hated was tim voice when he is possessed by the mask the voice is horrible also the scenes that he is in are so unfunny that they are almost unbearable i am sure they could have cut him out and it wouldn't affect the movie at all br br overall you can live without seeing this it is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch though they definitely could have gone without making the sequel but it is a decent effort 4 10
<START> i didn't see such a movie where the creators put so much <UNK> blood into their work and paid attention to the finest details for a very long time br br everything was well thought and perfectly put into reality camera work editing and <UNK> worked so good together it was just amazing the titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed br br this movie just blew me away br br the showdown could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes though br br it's a near to perfect homage to early silent noir films story acting scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and believable to have com from the times of silent film making
<START> veteran tv director ted post treats us to a plodding confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from <UNK> b of the harold robbins big book of plots set against a <UNK> phoenix <UNK> post <UNK> angles <UNK> smith takes a star turn as the woman whose eyes are mysteriously <UNK> at all times while <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> <UNK> around the <UNK> br br <UNK> goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> until a giallo style wrap up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end br br oh yeah and bob mitchum is in there too somewhere
<START> i really enjoyed this movie about a dog who becomes a duke it would have been very easy to mess this one up but along with the humor the script was filled with warmth and even some <UNK> about <UNK> and class it's a feel good movie that the whole family can watch even the adults
<START> if this movie had been directed by a man he would have been <UNK> while adrian <UNK> was <UNK> with a lawyer in the editing room to <UNK> the <UNK> of a classic piece of literature to <UNK> the censors and to avoid running <UNK> of the child pornography protection act of 1996 a woman <UNK> <UNK> on us and everyone <UNK> did i miss a meeting in addition to the blatant <UNK> this movie is utterly preposterous has this woman never set foot on an active military base has she never met a soldier whose army is this the uniforms must have come from uniforms r us just throw on some <UNK> who cares just make sure each and every one of them has a big red one there is a slight inside joke here that no doubt went over the <UNK> head but might possibly have been slipped in by whoever <UNK> the military vehicles certainly there were no military <UNK> the u s army does not operate <UNK> temporary base camps in jungle war <UNK> are <UNK> than this the u s army does not put 14 year old girls to work on military <UNK> nor allow them to use the firing <UNK> or training <UNK> there is much drama to be <UNK> in the sexual coming of age of teenage girls this movie has absolutely nothing to do with that whatsoever
<START> there is a growing trend in the media to <UNK> and <UNK> men one sees it in television <UNK> and program plots <UNK> is a prime example they could find plenty of female <UNK> yet the vast majority shown are men why the prime threat to any <UNK> power <UNK> in the male population they're less likely to <UNK> by authority and are more of a physical combat threat a way to <UNK> the threat is to <UNK> men in society via the media other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big <UNK> aggressive women <UNK> everyone they question <UNK> their rights and making those men feel like <UNK> in australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious <UNK> and drinking charges another example of the government controlling the male <UNK> by <UNK> their heroes and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aside from the political <UNK> is an invasion of <UNK> and a <UNK> of rights furthermore most of these women assault the men if it were round the other way the men would be in jail if it were an honest show they would be finding women <UNK> because they don't normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without <UNK> the boat men's <UNK> want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway
<START> i've heard a lot about porno holocaust and its twin film erotic nights of the living dead both films are <UNK> and were filmed at the same time on the same location with the same actors changing clothes for each film and taking them off if you are expecting the <UNK> genius displayed in films like <UNK> or death smiles on murder you won't find it here nonetheless this film has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie monster and his enormous penis that <UNK> and <UNK> women to death only from <UNK> there is some amount of gore in which many of the men are <UNK> to death the film is set on a beautiful <UNK> island as far as i know there is no subtitled version so if you don't speak italian you wont know what is going on but who cares right in all honesty gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex and if anyone is actually watching this for the sex only will for sure be offended instantly i can just imagine modern day porn fans <UNK> back through <UNK> <UNK> and coming across this atrocity out of the two i find erotic nights of the living dead far superior but don't bother watching either if they are cut porno holocaust is extremely low budget as expected even the monster looks no where as good as george <UNK> character in <UNK> the film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your <UNK> film quest
<START> adapted from sam <UNK> play this movie <UNK> many play like elements such as a relatively fixed setting a <UNK> 50's motel in the <UNK> and extensive intriguing dialogues a woman may is <UNK> by a man eddie played by sam shepard she tries to hide from him in the out of the way motel but he finds her the film explores the history of their relationship mainly from their <UNK> that has led them to this point it's very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional present relationship is a result of past events out of their control we mainly watch them fight make up fight make up and so on one image that stands out in my mind is of eddie <UNK> may over his shoulder kicking and screaming taking her somewhere she doesn't want to go br br the soundtrack is also perfect <UNK> country with <UNK> by a lesser known artist sandy rogers she has this country doll voice that almost at some points in the album this is the kind of movie that will stay <UNK> in some part of your brain soul in other words go see it
<START> arguably the most disgusting thing to come out of australia since predictably <UNK> comedy with barry <UNK> in a <UNK> role as <UNK> australian <UNK> les <UNK> and undercover agent dame <UNK> so many <UNK> function gags that even the <UNK> brothers would have been sick and several gross out moments especially the effects of the horrible h e l p virus only for fans of extreme toilet humor oh and <UNK> the <UNK> story ii not the mad max george miller who directed <UNK> br br
<START> there was a time when joel <UNK> was <UNK> quite high on my list of favorite directors back in the late 80's and early 90's when his name was attached to several great films like the lost boys and falling down he truly was one of the most gifted directors in hollywood then came the stupid batman sequels unfortunately and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in <UNK> hands both <UNK> and phone booth could have been much better films and even the incredibly <UNK> concept of the number 23 should have been <UNK> into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie literally from start to finish the number 23 desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clichés from the big book of cinema history including heavy voiced narration flashbacks <UNK> structure characters with multiple personalities numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings nothing helps however simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast crew as much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open minded regarding the insane theories this still remains a movie about a two <UNK> number and two <UNK> numbers aren't scary walter <UNK> jim carrey in a rare non comical role is a bored animal <UNK> whose wife agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday the book tells about all sorts of <UNK> theories and strange <UNK> that are linked to the number 23 walter almost promptly <UNK> himself with the <UNK> protagonist a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide and begins to spot <UNK> examples of the 23 <UNK> in his own private life i did some research on <UNK> and <UNK> and apparently this whole 23 <UNK> nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most <UNK> and <UNK> are directly connected to this evil number well that's just  crazy but hey i'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears regardless of how demented they are and i can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an out and out <UNK> <UNK> the number 23 is not suspenseful in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty make up effects and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life all cast members perform below their normal <UNK> but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely mrs virginia madsen in a relatively big production again definitely not recommended in case you're looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun but <UNK> and not entirely without merit
<START> when the new outer limits first started the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging as the series began to wind down most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value the six episodes here reflect the very best and worst of the series br br since the outer limits always <UNK> a moral i would like to offer my own starting with the most entertaining to the <UNK> br br 1 <UNK> as an institution the u s a military industrial complex is both evil and paranoid not to mention plain stupid however individuals with great integrity do serve our country and they will <UNK> their conscience even at a mind <UNK> cost in the end the aliens don't need to say a word those without a conscience are fools who are to be held in utter contempt br br a truly <UNK> episode one that should be shown on prime time television for all to see this might be a revelation for some but folks without a conscience should not be allowed to serve in our military nor do the ends justify the means br br 2 <UNK> theory a good person may be forced to make a split second decision between good or evil in order to save the lives of <UNK> intelligent beings and at great cost to one's self what makes this decision all the more difficult is the stark choice being <UNK> with exotic alien strangers who you can't even communicate with except through gestures or going along with a group of people you think will keep you safe from unknown dangers even if they are ruthless and devoid of compassion br br this episode is brilliant what <UNK> this <UNK> is good old fashioned greed this episode is one of the most <UNK> of capitalism <UNK> and <UNK> the environment i have ever seen in my lifetime unlike real life justice here is served and <UNK> br br one of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless corporate thug said something to the effect we did the same thing in the amazon <UNK> war <UNK> to the killing of <UNK> indians who were attempting to protect their rain <UNK> from being strip <UNK> as justification for killing again literally in the name of the survival of the <UNK> something <UNK> never meant to be taken literally br br 3 alien shop tremendous power can be used for good even from an exotic alien this power can be used to <UNK> instead of destroy mere <UNK> can learn from their mistakes even a criminal can see the light if given enough opportunity to do so br br sometimes it takes strong medicine but we all can wake up and change our self destructive ways br br 4 the an alien can be a christ like figure in the distant future slavery can be justified once again in the name of <UNK> basically good people can be <UNK> sometimes a person needs to be experience great shame in order to see the evil he she is committing children are closer to the truth than adults those with political power have tremendous responsibility another work of genius as a species do human beings learn from history br br flop number 1 quality of mercy loose lips sinks ships when in war kindly keep your mouth shut about important military plans gee did i really need to watch an hour long soap opera in order to figure this out i wonder did the makers of the outer limits run out of ideas or did corporate pull the plug dark and ugly serving no purpose but despair br br flop number 2 beyond the <UNK> so bad there is no moral but this when locked up in a mental hospital use some common sense please this episode is so bad it <UNK> what an x files rip off don't waste your time on this one you'll thank me later br br it's a sad commentary that the outer limits went down the <UNK> toward the end of its run <UNK> episodes like the first four could not last forever it was a miracle they were made at all hopefully someday other brave souls will follow the <UNK> outer limits tradition into new territory br br if you happen to be such a daring person a good place to start is with one unique book <UNK> of wonder a critical guide to science fiction edited by neil <UNK> as far as i'm concerned the most <UNK> book ever written on the subject
<START> means take up and read which is precisely what i felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film br br von <UNK> and <UNK> with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> 1995 new <UNK> article of the same name the incredible performance by tom <UNK> is brilliant and provocative and the editing sound design cinematography and directing are truly inspired the nuanced changes and <UNK> on the original story are subtle clever and make the film <UNK> more dynamic it's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again br br watch out for this young director he's going places
<START> the <UNK> directors and actors have lost sight of the <UNK> of a good story the concept of suspension of disbelief in <UNK> the concept goes up in smoke almost as quickly as the city contrary to earlier <UNK> i much preferred <UNK> peak amongst the <UNK> vintage of <UNK> movies
<START> film about the failure of government and the <UNK> of adults overwhelming <UNK> of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living only living staying alive in a cruel world a nightmare world we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it to see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else they the children of the movie are <UNK> they are more than <UNK> by what is around them they see sex as an act like they are watching a tv program when the one boy is with the hooker <UNK> is sitting on the bed watching with a blank stare no feeling he wants to be a little boy and have a family but the hooker has no compassion either and pushes him away a human film with human relations and moral judgement in a ugly scared cruel world reminds us that life is not fair but you can still have a human connection
<START> this is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant that really is if you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point you could describe as manipulative but what if it is really serious that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn't answered but what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you and is <UNK> rejected by the fact that you are ugly wouldn't you fight for it at least i think it is better to fight for it that die in <UNK> and it reminds me of the fact how i as a man react at first sight completely on the physical <UNK> of and don't look further at the person she is or might be this movie confronts me with very <UNK> questions about respect trust feeling manipulated and so on how do i now if someone <UNK> me or is just trying everything to make contact what i think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that <UNK> <UNK> made it absolutely believable that <UNK> falls in love with
<START> if a joke doesn't offend anybody it isn't funny br br the cartoons are offensive no doubt about it so is rap music get over it i suspect that any sane black person will find the cartoons hilarious and that the people who are offended by them white people who still think <UNK> need their <UNK> protection against racist humor br br seriously the cartoons are funny it <UNK> me that not because anybody is really offended but because somebody might just might be offended i can't buy cartoons or the african queen or song of the south on dvd
<START> che is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an unintentionally funny film it takes a serious subject and presents it like the cliff notes version or classic comics because there isn't much emotion or a proper narrative just episodic segments <UNK> together with mostly stupid true stories <UNK> by a variety of br br this is a deservedly <UNK> film as it is poorly written and acted however what i have found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext instead of che <UNK> and <UNK> castro working towards a communist cuba they seem to be more of a gay couple with che behaving <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> again and again the film <UNK> with great lines such as when <UNK> <UNK> che cuba needs you i need you i am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual <UNK> but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to recognize it i am very surprised that the other reviewers didn't point this out however if you remember this when you watch the film it makes viewing much more exciting and even funnier br br a final note in recent years che has been very <UNK> even a fashion statement with <UNK> of brain dead teens who have no idea who he was wearing shirts <UNK> with his face considering he was a cold blooded killer and <UNK> an odd combination for a doctor this new <UNK> for the man is gross what will they do next put hitler or dr on t shirts and posters even <UNK> with should be appalled by the bloodshed guevara was responsible for and i find it ironic that people with computers are <UNK> a man who might likely have killed them given half a chance br br considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was it does nothing to further the message that guevara was no hero i would love to see a realistic film done of his life with the good and the bad but also with dialog and a plot that weren't apparently created by <UNK>
<START> so i was completely in love with this movie <UNK> for it even with all its plot twists but the one thing i found really disturbing was the connection between the two best friends in tim and kyle while the writer of the film gave us such a poignant moment between the two and their sexual <UNK> confusion he then gives us a plot twist that makes them half brothers although the subject isn't brought up in the film and left unexplained and <UNK> for i just thought that it was in bad taste and the fact that it wasn't even discussed is even worse <UNK> we've created a taboo now let's not address the situation because that wouldn't really be p c otherwise a spectacular film
<START> this is what movies should <UNK> to funny without being totally stupid a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs biting without <UNK> to <UNK> every line i've been seeing justin long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years i figured with the right role he could break out mac commercials not <UNK> this film just might put him on a fast track to the a list the rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly this is an excellent little film with a nice message but you don't need to buy the message to have a good time lewis black is as usual hilarious and blake lively is a fresh faced beauty br br take a couple hours and see this film they will not have been wasted
<START> upon writing this review i have difficulty trying to think of what to write about nothing much happens in this film the storyline is a south asian woman who falls for an english <UNK> the problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak at the same time her friend at work is <UNK> to her having sexual relations with her brother and it just <UNK> from there the problem is that this movie is very predictable as soon as all this stuff has happened it's all pretty much standard it drags slightly even though it's only about 90 minutes long this is more of a chick flick than anything else so if you're male i do not recommend this film to you
<START> after a while i realized it was just my iq slowly dropping <UNK> is one of those pathetic movies where no one and i mean no one is even trying i <UNK> for the <UNK> hero to die inside that <UNK> how did he even manage to fit in there anyway <UNK> <UNK> the queen of b movies was horribly unfunny and ripped me and my friends off by not showing her boobs a single time br br the characters though i use that term loosely are people so exaggerated and one dimensional they might as well have used cardboard <UNK> the jokes i use this term loosely as well are simply hilarious a guy's fart causes an <UNK> our hero gets a butt by <UNK> <UNK> oh god i can't breathe the blind guy uses the f word repeatedly this is too much br br say what you want about the acting but i thought adam did a pretty good job at playing a mentally challenged apart from that the sole source of entertainment value here is boobs i think i counted three maybe four <UNK> throughout the entire film scattered over maybe five minutes of screen time that's five minutes worth watching out of <UNK> minutes of unfunny trash don't watch this watch <UNK> wire with pamela anderson at least there was plenty of nudity and action in that trashy flick r 26
<START> book of revelations starts very well daniel an <UNK> dancer is kidnapped abused and sexually raped by three masked women br br after that nothing else really happens there is some hint of <UNK> but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic he <UNK> dancing has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman br br i have seen a good share of art house movies but this has something missing in it br br the main leads are fine but some characters does not seems to be completely defined
<START> this has to be one of the funniest movies i've ever seen the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness when mom and dad both lose there jobs not to mention they have green <UNK> in their <UNK> they decide it's in their families best interest to move to <UNK> once there everything goes wrong an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie including a young molly <UNK> this a movie i would <UNK> recommend
<START> <UNK> this is the final film of the left behind series which is <UNK> preacher and novelist tim idea of what we can expect in our future in the final days of planet earth if this is the case we can expect an <UNK> <UNK> in every sense of the word if <UNK> <UNK> becomes president next year br br the fantastic four of revelation are all back with one cast change arnold who most would know as the <UNK> <UNK> in life with derek is now the minister taking the place of clarence brad johnson as the anti <UNK> pilot by day and christian by night is there as his daughter <UNK> and ace <UNK> reporter kirk cameron these are the only four people on earth who have <UNK> the true nature of un secretary general <UNK> and once again are throwing sand in his <UNK> br br this time they've got as an ally the president of the united states who is played by louis <UNK> jr he's having one hell of a rough time especially the <UNK> launch on <UNK> attack on a presidential killing vice president charles martin smith that's right the <UNK> is vice president somebody really messed up bad here because everyone including those who would do them harm know a president and vice president never travel together br br it takes all of them the entire film to convince <UNK> exactly who really is once again the best one in the film is gordon <UNK> as br br we may yet see another left behind film yet the door was left open though people assure me that they've run out of source material from tim i suppose as long as they make money and these players can't get jobs in the mainstream film industry and there are some <UNK> plot issues involving brad johnson and <UNK> noble who is mrs kirk cameron in real life br br one of the fantastic four does die in this film so will it be the fantastic three or will they get another fourth stay tuned
<START> this is very much overrated i guess it carries some nostalgic value for many people it has its moments but every scene is heavily <UNK> and the plot is quite shallow with this cast it could have been much better
<START> i realize most people don't know who <UNK> kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience but then why bother to call it <UNK> kane in the first place when the name has no <UNK> value the characters certainly has nothing whatsoever to do with the r e howard character except he has a big hat that's where the resemblance ends br br it's always a bad sign when any superhero fantasy sci fi movie <UNK> over an origin story but when you <UNK> one whole cloth like this for a character who didn't have one at all you've already missed the point completely kane is no longer even the <UNK> christian warrior of the stories but rather a <UNK> bad guy who is trying to save his soul this part is in the opening scene br br with the most basic character elements changed or simply ignored the use of the name <UNK> kane is simply <UNK> is it just so they can say from the creator of conan and hope to plug into a budding franchise if the new conan movie gets off the ground ignoring the complete departure from the stories the movie is competent if utterly generic for the first half but then <UNK> into sheer stupidity in the climactic scene which involves multiple super baddies think three boss levels at the same time none of whom is the least bit interesting or menacing br br if i wasn't a kane fan who was disappointed that they completely ignored the source material i'd probably give the film a 3 or 4 instead of a 1 even for the majority of viewers who will come into this knowing nothing about kane it's pretty thin <UNK>
<START> if you took all the stock elements of a shrek movie grumpy ogre annoying <UNK> cute kitty obligatory dance number etc put them in a <UNK> and <UNK> it to 20 minutes you'd have this mess painful to watch i may have laughed once the story and dialogue are rushed beyond <UNK> with the voice actors sounding like they <UNK> in their lines the final <UNK> rendition of the christmas story poem felt like it was written by a <UNK> in five minutes and boy a little eddie murphy goes a long way with its desperate attempt to be hip and current this show will be long outdated and forgotten while classics like the will remain timeless a sad waste of effort by all involved a <UNK> jumping of the shark for the shrek franchise
<START> perhaps it's just the format of this film a documentary but i believe that the movie would have been much better served by good actors and more solid dialogue the fact that the actors are also the business owners is a double edged sword they know better than anyone else the emotions and <UNK> of the business they were in but since they are not professional actors they do a very poor job of conveying those emotions and the documentary suffers there were some truly memorable scenes in this movie and lots of good lines but they were delivered so poorly that they will fade away with time and the only memory i will have of this documentary is that it had some good scenes which i can't remember br br watch this if you want a first hand account of the com bust and see what happened to the 99 of people in the industry who didn't become instant however be prepared for some nauseating camera work poor acting poor dialogue and an overall bad movie that <UNK> the era of the internet boom
<START> after reading some of the earlier nasty remarks i had to put in my two cents this show was not despite what that <UNK> in <UNK> thinks the worst thing that ever aired on tv i think most of today's tv is much worse when is this stupid reality <UNK> ever going to end and there isn't a current show i can stand to watch <UNK> the stuff i grew up with i'm a 1965 baby and not ashamed to admit it br br this show has been my all time favorite for almost 30 years i was in high school when it originally aired and i think it helped me to hang on throughout those miserable days i was such a <UNK> back then and fantasy island <UNK> to my imagination as i was a budding writer in those days it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft what a wonderful premise i won't say it didn't have its faults sometimes the scripts were pretty bad and some of the problems seemed trivial but it could be good too and it was a blast to watch and still is as for the cheesiness factor well i think it's unfair to label every single 70s product as cheesy there was a lot of great stuff back then and this was among the ranks btw most of the seasons aired in the 80s my favorite episodes came from seasons 2 3 and 4 mostly br br to those who <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for his heavy french accent and his short stature grow up and learn something it's so easy to make fun when you're normal and perfect that man made the best of what he was dealt in life and if you don't like it that's just tough have a little compassion he's been dead 15 years and how easy it is to cut down someone who can't defend himself there's just no shame anymore br br i love this show so it looks dated hate to tell you this but we didn't have <UNK> special effects and <UNK> ray <UNK> we were lucky to have <UNK> live with it accept it for what it is and that's just plain fun <UNK> tv describes it perfectly and that's what it was for me an escape from my rotten real life and it's still a lot of fun to watch
<START> this has got to be the best movie i've seen you <UNK> have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists i'm no fan of george clooney but he shines here the real performance comes from tim blake nelson and john <UNK> as pete and <UNK> one of the few movies that i own
<START> a three stooges short this one featuring <UNK> of all those involving <UNK> i've seen this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short the basic plot is that <UNK> must get married by 6 <UNK> that very evening if he's to <UNK> the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will so <UNK> sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a <UNK> road than expected that is until they learn of his inheritance money best bits here involve <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and moe in a <UNK> booth and larry on piano as <UNK> to <UNK> voice training session also the sequence where <UNK> is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious
<START> keep away from this one the worst thing is the appalling story there seems to be an intent to convey some subtle spiritual love friendship message but it is so <UNK> devoid of any substance you can't help but cringe in addition the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves criminals and our hero <UNK> dealing with some alien time travel <UNK> i know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time but the story is more full of holes than usual also you have cheap sets bad acting and some of the worst music <UNK> in the history of the moving picture <UNK> cheap abrupt and disjointed all i can say is man alive this film is bad
<START> obviously influenced by the success of <UNK> destination moon and x m this one just doesn't make the cut limited special effects a thin story line result in a production that even the half decent cast can't save just no believability here no one seems surprised to encounter martians much like <UNK> etc etc pass on it
<START> bloody birthday is a totally rubbish slasher movie from beginning to end br br i found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget i don't know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly way too over <UNK> maybe this is a bad transfer to dvd or maybe it always looked like that i don't know br br there really are no redeeming qualities to speak of there are a few deaths but not really gory i wouldn't bother with it if i was you the best thing about the dvd was the 15 minute interview with producer max <UNK> who was very amusing and honest he didn't have anything good to say about director ed hunt and admits the movie was a failure but he would like to re make it as he believes it has a decent plot however he died in 2004 so i guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge with the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldn't surprise me there's at least one re make per week at the cinema these day it couldn't be any worse than the original i suppose but i couldn't care less whether it got re made or not
<START> i am assuming that the rave reviews on this page were from people who have never read the book unfortunately for those of us who love the text hollywood <UNK> itself on destroying this one br br i am not sure where on earth the woman love interest came from except that she replaced the cat nor why our rogue male acquired a helpful family back in <UNK> in fact the vast majority of the book has been cut out and replaced with your standard <UNK> love story the ambiguity about which world leader was in his sights was removed completely and our rogue was given a name neither of these appeared until the second book br br i gave it a 2 rather than a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents joan bennett <UNK> dick van dyke in mary <UNK> by miles and this goes a tiny way towards saving it br br ah well brits should probably avoid this trust me
<START> the 3rd and last big screen spin off from the very popular <UNK> sitcom of the early 1970's holiday on the <UNK> is every bit as <UNK> and crude as the previous two efforts and <UNK> from a standpoint three and a half decades later it is truly mind <UNK> that even one film was produced in this franchise br br what <UNK> the plot <UNK> the adventures of stan butler <UNK> <UNK> his conductor jack bob grant and their <UNK> inspector blake stephen lewis after their from their regular jobs at the bus <UNK> they all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with <UNK> family doris <UNK> anna karen michael robbins following br br british cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for high quality in the 1960's but much of this was due to american financial support and <UNK> which sadly drew to a close as the 1970's <UNK> thereafter notable <UNK> titles get carter being the among these very few exceptions became as rare as mick jagger in a stable marriage and uk cinema went down the road of cheap budgets sleazy and witless sex comedies the <UNK> series come play with me and <UNK> <UNK> celluloid versions of various tv shows mostly sitcoms this being one of many hideous examples only <UNK> army and <UNK> came off fairly <UNK> in this regard the quirky success of the first on the <UNK> film it was the biggest box office hit of it's year in 1971 nonsensical to think now led to two further sequels br br to be fair the tv series itself had a cheerful <UNK> non pc <UNK> about it which was reasonably tolerable in half hour sitcom form but stretched to three times that length it <UNK> the patience beyond belief it's <UNK> that hammer films produced this effort as it virtually resembles a horror film in the literal sense with ancient <UNK> hackneyed poorly timed slapstick and awful seedy production values br br a chance to send up the cheesiness of the british holiday camp is totally wasted here in favour of the above elements and it is most bizarre if not gruesome to see the obviously 50 something <UNK> and the <UNK> long <UNK> grant managing to instantly charm young women barely in their early <UNK> while constantly laughing at their own <UNK> and lame jokes the presence of <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> and son <UNK> the aged miss <UNK> does not help matters either and even though the film lasts about 1 and a half hours it drags on to an <UNK> depressing degree br br thankfully this was the last film in this most dire of film <UNK> and the tv series itself came to an end around the same time with a sequel don't drink the water which was <UNK> <UNK> by the critics and ignored by audiences following in 1975 most of the leading actors involved were not seen much afterwards but the worst affected was bob grant <UNK> with depression and other mental problems for many years he committed suicide in 2003 a sad <UNK> to a sitcom that was the most popular of it's era it has not aged too well either and should have remained that way rather than the three <UNK> successful but artistically hopeless big screen <UNK> which <UNK> the happy memories and occasional merits of it's tv counterpart br br rating 2 and a half out of 10
<START> i have just returned from santa <UNK> i visited <UNK> as i looked around this building which has been acquired by a private owner i <UNK> the movie version of the <UNK> it is an overwhelming <UNK> that <UNK> this building it is about what can happen if you really have faith the <UNK> there has a narrative on the subject which is the story of the <UNK> i read the narrative in its entirety i was absorbed by the ambiance surrounding the people <UNK> it was like we were totally <UNK> in a time <UNK> all with the same thoughts and awe when we <UNK> the <UNK> was overwhelming everyone should visit <UNK> in santa <UNK>
<START> <UNK> of shows what happens when creators of an anime fail to understand what their fans want i as a fan did not want a <UNK> evil nazi movie what i would have liked to see is a real final showdown between ed and <UNK> as we don't really know what became of her i also would have liked to get ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there to finally get a chance to be normal you know raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic that sort of thing no instead i got a convoluted plot involving nazi <UNK> fritz lang and about ten minutes of al a joke of a cameo by roy <UNK> and only one armstrong joke one short joke and no hitting ed with a <UNK> above all it just didn't feel like <UNK> to me
<START> okay i grew up on who but haven't loved a doctor since tom baker christopher <UNK> made me love who again and i'll be furious with him forever for leaving br br the writing is grand the acting superb the directing which was dreadful in the old days is just fantastic i was very skeptical about this programme and watched it merely out of being forced but am now a huge fan and love it i have a of a <UNK> screaming <UNK> then br br a few of the things i love about the new programme 1 people actually notice when rose <UNK> <UNK> disappears off the planet some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while and then come home like nothing has happened no one noticed 2 chris <UNK> doc loves rose romantic or not will be <UNK> but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about his companion he'd destroy the world if he had to to save her which the old show was lacking often a doctor wouldn't care if he never saw his <UNK> again 3 they talk and think like real people when rose is shown something outlandish or new such as aliens she acts like a real person would <UNK> i never liked it when an assistant from the old show who never saw anything alien would just fit right in and adapt instantly i want to see the surprise on <UNK> face when she sees a plastic <UNK> come to life she gives that to me br br the few things i don't like about this series 1 nearly everything happens on earth london or <UNK> and i was sort of hoping for a more off world sort of show 2 that <UNK> left so quickly he really made the show brilliant br br but i can let those few things go i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to so i don't mind if they have stuff set on earth br br just don't take this show seriously it's fun it's smart it's entertaining but it's not a super serious heavy duty show it's pure fun and pure british and i can't get enough watch it with an open mind and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy br br ps don't watch series 2 or later series 1 was brilliant the first few episodes of series 2 were good but don't watch it once it gets to love and monsters utter rubbish completely destroys the show
<START> i would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if i had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in north america as a porn film our obsession with what is or should be regarded as pornographic remains a <UNK> of the provided to film makers by the hayes <UNK> many many years ago and it is now really time that we <UNK> it to the past so far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat <UNK> division between what we now term <UNK> and porn with both carrying the same pornography label it is time for us all <UNK> that neither the r rated soft porn release version of this film nor the <UNK> version hard porn available on dvd were in any way pornographic br br in legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to <UNK> or corrupt many classic books such as lady lover <UNK> hill women in love the story of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> have been <UNK> for pornographic content tried by jury and <UNK> on the basis of this definition but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal and apply a simpler test that is rather too <UNK> when applied to books or films which are very close to the line but serves to quickly clear most others from any <UNK> of pornography although the hayes code would have rated as <UNK> both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real <UNK> it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting <UNK> or unstable relationships should be <UNK> as pornographic only that these may need a more sophisticated <UNK> in we have a film about a young female <UNK> who has had a rather <UNK> upbringing and keeps her <UNK> at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis <UNK> where everyone she meets is totally <UNK> about their sexual needs she is shocked but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored and the film ends with them living ever with their children in a home with a white <UNK> fence and a family dog an ending clearly directed to those <UNK> who remain very young at heart br br pornographic hardly br br suitable viewing for children well probably not quite unless they have very <UNK> parents br br r rating pg would be more appropriate today br br entertaining for viewers in most age groups yes but the film has its faults these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb however most <UNK> clearly appreciated and enjoyed it br br i believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an anti pornography <UNK> of scientific proof that a magazine picture of <UNK> <UNK> was a <UNK> montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models these and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format the last was a dvd containing both the r rated and <UNK> versions of the film released by <UNK> cinema in 2007 copies of this were readily available until a few months ago now they are almost exhausted and the mail order <UNK> who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price a situation which usually quickly results in a new dvd release appearing this continuing interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released points to near classic status br br <UNK> on this <UNK> are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful <UNK> on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect self censorship <UNK> <UNK> with the hayes <UNK> on this <UNK> such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as <UNK> and i seldom make them but fortunately i still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual and is well worth watching or even buying it is flawed but <UNK> <UNK> gives a great performance and the film provides a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience overall i would rate it at 7 stars and will be buying a copy of the next dvd edition if and when it appears if ms <UNK> is still alive today i would love to hear her comments both on the attempts to <UNK> this film and on the late recognition that it has gradually achieved
<START> this is one of the films that killed the spaghetti western it not only loses something in the translation it is a total chaotic mess of editing as well either <UNK> of it have been edited out and or re edited for an english language version in any case it makes little or no sense period it makes the <UNK> and the eastwood man with no name films look like john ford john wayne by comparison nothing in this film is original somewhere in there is a beginning a middle and finally an end except for the end not everything is exactly in that order robert wood seems <UNK> enough the rest of the cast especially the women should have made better career choices
<START> i don't know why all the previous comments are <UNK> of this movie it is well not by far but the <UNK> movie i've seen lately full of clichés bad acting actually no very bad acting and has a silly plot if i would have seen it in a cinema i would have walked out after the first 20 minutes i f you hate somebody make him her watch this movie that's how bad it is a girl who has an imaginary boy friend that gives up a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealous but i think it figures she takes after her parents who also have some mental issues plus the character who is supposed to be i think the laughing stock of it the thing that should make you laugh <UNK> room mate is a serious nut case and just makes me feel sorry for him and the whole movie
<START> the opening scene makes you feel like you're watching a high school play but i've seen high school plays with better acting every line was delivered so obviously that i felt like i was watching actors work instead of seeing characters i found the character development to be poor and the acting very forced i found that 25 minutes into the movie i really didn't care what happened anymore because the plot was overly obvious and i was bored i kept hanging in there waiting for the film to redeem itself but it never happened sister <UNK> was overly sweet even for a nun yet appeared <UNK> and slightly manipulative all in all i was mighty disappointed
<START> those people who told me this movie is good shame on them this film is for an audience who has no problem to watch everything especially when it's all about tough guys guns chasing <UNK> i <UNK> compare this movie with the inside man the same loss of time i'm tired of copy and <UNK> movies and i'm <UNK> but what can i do fans of that types of movies are much more if you want to watch good movie from that type i will recommend to you lucky number <UNK> i'm not mean i just dislike this movie weak actors weak script weak action probably someone else will like it many people many tastes however for me chaos is tasteless
<START> apart from the da james and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to ellen <UNK> <UNK> plight ellen herself is the only convincing character and likable character in the movie she is the one not her dying mother who should be and is the one true thing it's not only in the role in acting but also in the plot itself until the plot turns against itself and makes the mother the one true thing in the eyes of her weak <UNK> shallow husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter the daughter <UNK> what the viewer <UNK> but such intelligent <UNK> must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is <UNK> out on both the realities of his wife and daughter br br to boot the one powerful scene in this whole movie when ellen confronts her father's cruelty is given the lie at the end ellen is just another young strong woman who must be <UNK> into <UNK> by a <UNK> father a very flawed movie so flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time
<START> alien body <UNK> in the desert little blue rocks that look like they are made from cheap plastic the overall storyline isn't bad if you like that kind of thing but the acting is so far beyond poor that it <UNK> me that some of them actually entertained my in the x files and the special effects hello where did they get their fx crew from secondary school i mean come on there was so much more they could have done it was amateur and extremely basic i didn't particularly enjoy it and my dad fell asleep during it and of course our hero falls in love with the leading lady its so typical and highly predictable
<START> i thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion i agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters i think that this is what what made the film good it didn't <UNK> either mr or mrs kramer and it was refreshing i think to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for billy and although it was a little strange i actually liked the music in this film as well for some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters <UNK> upon this movie <UNK> quite well and didn't <UNK> like some emotionally heavy films tend to do it dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously it simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well
<START> charles bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen but this movie lacks everything that a thriller action movie should have there are a few action scenes in the movie but they're really crappy and when the action scenes fail does the story save the film not at all is my answer to that the story is even worse than the action scenes it's very straightforward and boring and even though i'm a big movie fan i almost fell asleep several times i don't know how they came up with a failure like this a low budget maybe regardless of that it looked like all the actors had no interest in being in the movie at all when that happens the result is really bad
<START> i like movies but this one is the best i've seen at <UNK> animal warmth with sexual intelligence anne is electric and the script is amazing especially considering it's supposed to take place on the set of another of movies you don't have to agree with her take on everything to get a lot out of this it made me think a lot about vulnerability and power try to imagine a male director with <UNK> not impossible but a little mind <UNK> the <UNK> sexual <UNK> that are always present when humans get together to make anything is held up to bright light here but not a cold light
<START> this is a brilliant lavish czech film from the <UNK> father and son team all about two czech pilots who flee to england to help the <UNK> in the battle of britain but who also fall out over a woman the beautiful tara fitzgerald features some excellent and incredibly realistic <UNK> combat scenes  probably the best ever and much better than pearl <UNK> or even the film battle of britain and a number of interesting general themes such as love war romance <UNK> loss and <UNK> also the trials and <UNK> of moving abroad and learning a foreign language though made easier here with the great <UNK> anna massey br br the film has some great little <UNK> such as the world famous <UNK> <UNK> device shown throughout and at one point nicely reflected in the black <UNK> record spinning around <UNK> music is another theme of the film of course plus all of the traditional icons of english life <UNK> beer glasses unlike the post war straight glasses used in pearl <UNK> tea in a nice china tea set in an english country garden though shot in the czech republic the <UNK> dog a vintage bottle of <UNK> <UNK> even a <UNK> board br br of course the <UNK> and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of england though the <UNK> sequences make up for this showing and the seven sisters always <UNK> with southern england and the battle of britain but best of all is the sensational musical score from <UNK> as good as anything from hans <UNK> yet all in the tradition of the late excellent ron <UNK> who scored the original battle of britain film amongst other classic english war films there's even a nice little cameo role for the  apparently  famous czech musician and actor and kevin kline <UNK> <UNK> who plays on the piano the title theme song dark blue sky excellent br br it's got a few <UNK> yet funny little <UNK> devices too such as always showing an <UNK> <UNK> floating by the ceiling whenever <UNK> the <UNK> but brilliant is stuck at the <UNK> while his love rival and fellow pilot <UNK> <UNK> is with susan br br another great english actor in this film charles dance is of course fine as wing commander <UNK> br br highly recommended and well worth watching hiring  get the dvd with special features stuff like how they created the dog fights and stuff probably the only film ever to combine subtitles with characters speaking english german french and czech all at once
<START> in halloween three friends seek an ancient cemetery in the <UNK> for fun and remove a cross from a tomb where jack o was buried many years ago by the farmer arthur kelly the evil creature is unleashed kills the trio and seeks the <UNK> of the kelly family for revenge br br the cheesy jack o is a combination of a terrible story with awful acting i was curious with the name of john carradine in the credits and i can not imagine how a relative <UNK> the use of archive footage in such a bad movie showing a total lack of respect with the name of this great actor it is impressive how bad the acting is shifting the film to a comedy instead of the <UNK> horror genre this is the type of movie good to see with a group of friends drinking beer making comments and laughing a lot my vote is three br br title brazil jack o  do halloween jack o  demon of the halloween
<START> i can't actually think of one good point in this film the story is absolutely terrible the acting is as blunt as a <UNK> and the script is so bad it makes you want to kill yourself ok fine if you love and you have to love it to understand you might enjoy it <UNK> better as it has large mountains and some cool moves but apart from that it is terrible it has some absolutely stupid ideas and it is racist with both black and white people insulting each others races the only time you will laugh is when you are laughing at the stupidity or you are feeling embarrassed for the film i have seen a lot of films and i have to say that this is the worst film i have ever seen if you have this film i would suggest you take it back to wherever you bought it from and get you money back
<START> it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you don't have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tv set tip see it with some close friends
<START> i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd the director's cut version i was very surprised that it was rated g how did they get bedroom scenes a seduction story line two strip <UNK> acts and war shooting blood into a g rating weird i would rate it pg 13 br br other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it was a beautiful showcase of <UNK> voice and talent the acting was great the storyline was a little weak leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue there were too many no talking just walking scenes for me i would have liked to see the the relationship between julie and rock <UNK> so that the intense love would be more believable
<START> this show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today br br it's truly <UNK> how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining <UNK> of the guest <UNK> this show probably wouldn't still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of <UNK> that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i can't believe it's still on the air
<START> my wife and i struggle to find movies like this that are clean and yet enjoyable for adults if you can't find a cinema that is playing it call your cinema and request it bravo five sisters productions for courage <UNK> and creative <UNK>
<START> starting on or around 1965 american movies took a turn for the shocking and the <UNK> which was great for the times sort of the <UNK> that would <UNK> the way for <UNK> daring dramas however because the very decade that gave birth to these films was so ruled by its own <UNK> most all of the films released at this period have dated <UNK> flower is no exception its very title suggests a sunny romantic comedy with occasional <UNK> into the <UNK> this is not to say that it's a bad thing quite the contrary films about <UNK> subject matter have to begin somewhere and america being a culture <UNK> in specific traditions themselves laced in deep <UNK> shocks itself for the sake of it when seeing an <UNK> reflection of the <UNK> of the time meanwhile european films address these same situations walk off looking like a million bucks and have a longer shelf life because what we consider <UNK> they <UNK> off say next and move on br br toni simmons goldie hawn in her <UNK> role a young very sixties bright young thing is carrying on with a much older dentist named julian winston walter matthau who has commitment issues he marry her he's already married toni decides instead of <UNK> away she actually wants to meet his wife and set things straight into the picture comes his assistant stephanie dickinson a <UNK> ingrid bergman returning to american cinema after a twenty year absence a woman closer to his age who acts as if she and he had the perfect marriage and household there is a reason for this she has <UNK> quiet emotions for julian emotions he is unaware of even when he asks her to play his wife to ward toni off from wanting to step their relationship further and then he steps it up a notch when <UNK> innocent actions <UNK> the action off into the unexpected and he introduces harvey <UNK> jack <UNK> as <UNK> lover by the way harvey is also an older <UNK> who is having an affair with a much younger woman eve bruce whom he also lies to in one very funny scene br br it's funny how the person whom we're looking for is the one who's always been there what could have been a <UNK> role for rick <UNK> who plays <UNK> sullivan next door neighbor turns into the man who not only sees the true beauty in fellow <UNK> stephanie but the one who saves toni at the start from killing herself not the stuff of comedy suicide then again this is not your average comedy and needless to say is ingrid <UNK> subtle poignant portrayal of a woman who's somehow missed her chances at love who's become <UNK> who due to a lie said to another she becomes the real person she was always meant to be i can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role br br movies like these can be enjoyed at face value and seen as <UNK> fun a product of its times or be viewed for the deep symbolism that like its title it carries deep within it's a <UNK> film the same way <UNK> and <UNK> performance are equally <UNK> because in seeming so simple devoid of <UNK> and pose neither come out and <UNK> what they are about their acting becomes not really acting but playing real people <UNK> and all <UNK> flower is a story that never appears to take itself too seriously but reveals itself to be deep and very human after all
<START> i remember seeing this 1978 comedy at one of the bargain <UNK> i took in when i was looking for a study break from my college <UNK> walter matthau and glenda jackson do some effective tracy hepburn style <UNK> and <UNK> in this <UNK> romp directed by the reliable howard he did private benjamin about a newly widowed doctor's aggressive re entry into the dating game it all <UNK> by quickly primarily thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter <UNK> j <UNK> casablanca along with alan <UNK> max and future director charles <UNK> br br dr <UNK> <UNK> has just come back from hawaii after his wife's death upon his return he becomes aware that he is instant to any and all the single women in la he works in a hospital run by an increasingly <UNK> chief of staff <UNK> <UNK> whom <UNK> has to <UNK> to keep his <UNK> enter ann <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> for a living and has certain <UNK> opinions about the medical profession which she expresses <UNK> on a <UNK> talk show of course <UNK> is on the show's discussion <UNK> and sparks as they say fly this leads to the standard complications about how serious <UNK> is willing to become about ann at the same time the hospital has to deal with a potential <UNK> death <UNK> from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died at the hospital under <UNK> <UNK> br br it's just refreshing to see such a mature yet <UNK> love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the <UNK> wielding skill of <UNK> matthau is his usual 1970's <UNK> <UNK> and quite a sight <UNK> with his <UNK> arms held <UNK> in his power walk away from her heavy award winning <UNK> roles jackson is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> vulnerable as the <UNK> ann who thinks all doctors should <UNK> to be albert art <UNK> plays <UNK> with predictable <UNK> while richard benjamin provides <UNK> support as colleague dr <UNK> it's all very <UNK> with a few nice <UNK> at the greed within the medical profession there are no extras on the 2005 dvd
<START> i particularly enjoyed review of this film and agree that howard is not the only damaged character howard is rather <UNK> set up by the script but there is no evidence that his previous <UNK> is actually dead or if she is that he murdered her howard doesn't know and neither do we in terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there he <UNK> however he never actually <UNK> helen gordon no matter how <UNK> he is indeed he <UNK> with horror at <UNK> <UNK> spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of <UNK> then he <UNK> his <UNK> up and <UNK> the <UNK> helen with the almost pathetic i'm very tired now i think i'll go home frankly i don't think he's a psychopath a sick puppy certainly but not a psychopath br br the problem with howard is that he has no real male identity he wanted to serve his country but his mental condition <UNK> him a place in the army he is <UNK> <UNK> and isolated no wife no girl no home again at least as far as we know and he does a woman's job are my <UNK> <UNK> niece <UNK> <UNK> away this pride in his by <UNK> that she would want a man with a real job also although he finds himself strongly attracted to helen he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass he is remarkably <UNK> can't fight can't work can't make love br br helen is <UNK> terrified however she tries to connect to him but finding that he doesn't respond normally i e way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose <UNK> memories of husband ned <UNK> <UNK> all <UNK> buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape br br both characters trapped in the house trapped by fear <UNK> rage and memory deserve sympathy i know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers but i felt it <UNK> well as it offered a kind of release to the characters helen is freed i think from the past when howard tries on her husband's army coat <UNK> disgusted reaction is <UNK> she no doubt feels that the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> has been <UNK> but hopefully her need to keep everything <UNK> has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger perhaps she can move on br br howard is also freed from his endless cycle of anger hurt and violence whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is <UNK> but i hope it's the former br br great performances from ryan and <UNK> i prefer on dangerous ground but this is pretty good too
<START> when i reviewed the video for a local magazine i called it the greatest achievement in the history of the american cinema that was not wholly tongue in cheek <UNK> <UNK> remains best work and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore however <UNK> <UNK> remains a striking exposition of what once was known as the american character largely on the strength of brian <UNK> superb portrayal of teddy r obviously <UNK> and keith admired <UNK> tremendously to make two films about him including the rough riders it's hard to fault this film at any level a splendid balance of action <UNK> relationships and the serious topic of america coming of age in the world furthermore <UNK> <UNK> has exceptional appeal across the board note the <UNK> showing it rates best with under 18 males females 18 <UNK> and over 45 clearly candy <UNK> struck a <UNK> <UNK> with women as well as men
<START> br br when i rented a thousand <UNK> i thought i was in for an entertaining king <UNK> story and of course michelle pfeiffer was in it so what could go wrong br br very quickly however i realized that this story was about a thousand other things besides just <UNK> i started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended thank you jane laura and <UNK> for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie thank you cast for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and <UNK> br br i recognized the angry sister the runaway sister and the sister in denial i recognized the abusive husband and why he was there and then the father oh oh the father all superbly played i also recognized myself and this movie was an eye opener a relief a chance to face my own truth and finally doing something about it i truly hope a thousand <UNK> has had the same effect on some others out there br br since i didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land they weren't fighting each other at all i watched it a second time then i was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story one would easily miss the overwhelming <UNK> of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all that is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance br br but yet another reason why this movie is so perfect br br i don't give a <UNK> ass <UNK> my french about to what <UNK> the king <UNK> story is followed all i know is that i can honestly say this movie has changed my life br br keep up the good work guys you can and do make a difference br br
<START> they should make terrorists watch this video as torture and not just for the disturbing final scene in which <UNK> up and beating a woman with mental problems is apparently a source of comedy about a half hour of this would convince even the <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> rather than sit through even one more minute of this disaster br br this movie is awful i rented it because a friend said it was hilarious only to find he was talking about the <UNK> director doing the commentary rather than the movie itself i guess if you find <UNK> arrogance funny you'll like this it apparently is true that he goes on and on about chicks he's <UNK> the most tasteless example being when the lead actress comes on screen br br actually <UNK> <UNK> was the only good part of this movie her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrid dung pile this apparently is the only movie she's done according to imdb i hope she is involved with theatre or indie stuff as i think she has the talent and natural beauty to really be an asset to any production
<START> if <UNK> <UNK> was armed he may well have been joe however all in the family would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of this movie joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a <UNK> and has a big mouth especially when he's drunk one night he meets a man in a bar bill who is having a drink to <UNK> his <UNK> nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's <UNK> boyfriend and he lets that slip to joe what happens is that <UNK> daughter was living with the <UNK> and she's <UNK> off to the hospital after an <UNK> and he goes by the apartment to collect her things but doesn't expect that he'll actually run into the boyfriend who comes in fresh from a big drug deal in the struggle that ensues the boyfriend is killed accidentally and bill doesn't want anyone really to know of course but he lets it slip to joe and then when the <UNK> and tv reports come out joe sees them puts 2 and 2 together and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes he <UNK> up with him later and bill is of course concerned that joe is going to blackmail him but not for money he wants to hang out with him which is in a way almost worse now <UNK> daughter escapes from the clinic she's in and slips back home and accidentally <UNK> what happened and then is on the run and most of the rest of the movie consists of joe bill <UNK> the underground to try to find her this builds up to a rather shocking ending which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note or wrong note depending on your point of view a sort of decent but dim view of life in the early 70's mostly from a working class point of view which makes it not for everyone but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch 8 out of 10
<START> this is one heck of a sleazy film like so many women in chains films this one is chock full of <UNK> however unlike most prior films which strongly implied this black mama white mama shows an awful lot of skin as a horny female prison guard <UNK> at the women as they shower as well as has sex with one of the inmates for the early 1970s this is definitely a soft core pornographic film sort of like girls gone wild goes to prison it's also a bad rip off of the <UNK> ones though in this case it's two hot females who hate each other who are <UNK> together when they escape whereas the original film is considered a classic this one can only be considered a classic example of bad taste that's because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap cheap thrills cheap writing and very cheap acting br br pam <UNK> is the black <UNK> with an attitude a lady who was set up and sent to prison on this <UNK> island margaret <UNK> is a revolutionary when they escape they both can't stand each other and have opposite goals however since it is cliché driven there's really no surprise in how the film ends with their both becoming gag me friends
<START> i hadn't planned on seeing this movie however i wasn't disappointed when a friend dragged me along although there are no real surprises here the guys do reasonably well with their obviously modest budget br br if you've seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there's a pretty constant stream of jokes here with a couple of classic moments with the <UNK> probably being an excellent flashback to what the guys were like in the 1980's also i've read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment but i found it <UNK> different from what i had expected from this genre br br overall this movie wont change your life but it's got enough laughs there to keep you entertained throughout
<START> the war on everything is a weekly show from the guys that brought you and the <UNK> decides where each week the 5 <UNK> and <UNK> break down the issues that we didn't know were important br br this show goes beyond the mere <UNK> of politics and television by not being afraid to take the mickey out of anyone whether it be a counter girl at subway or even the prime minister of australia and although this may be familiar ground in say american television it has never been this well executed br br the war on everything is the <UNK> funniest and overall most entertaining show on australian television and if you haven't seen it you seriously owe it to yourself to give it a watch
<START> the curse of monkey island released <UNK> 6 years after the success of monkey island 2 you would think with monkey island <UNK> <UNK> ending that it would finish monkey island once and for all but it all turned out to be a trick to lure into <UNK> but enough about that the whole <UNK> of this is that monkey island has returned and the voices are just <UNK> if were to make a movie cartoon of monkey island this would probably be what it would look like and sound like it's plot is real good and everything about it is just awesome if you haven't heard about the monkey island series buy the monkey island <UNK> or the monkey island <UNK> pack and play through all the games starting with the secret of monkey island then monkey island 2 and the curse of monkey island monkey island 4 was real good but this one tops them all
<START> when we all know no one does it like the bbc br br being an avid fan of this sort of sunday night watching i was quite looking forward to this how disappointed was i in the first thirty seconds i didn't think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch br br however me and my friends <UNK> only to find bad acting and a complete <UNK> of half of the characters the plot was <UNK> to the extreme and the make up and costumes <UNK> and very 21st century in a robin style this modern style may have been able to be placed within sharp camera angles and visually <UNK> cinematography but unfortunately we got neither the direction felt decidedly sloppy for both acting and shot choice br br after 30 mins we couldn't bare to watch it and went out and rented 'the which is very good btw maybe it is unfair that i judge this as i have watched so little of this but rarely have i felt so compelled to warn people not to watch something however me and my friends did think that the house and were pretty but thats as good as it gets
<START> when this showed at the seattle <UNK> film fest i was the only person standing and <UNK> and cheering the rest of the crowd <UNK> or was silent it is a well played small film that reaches deep into the reality of a young gay man's humanity it is about a real man and does not play to the insipid hyper <UNK> muscular gay that passes for the genre of non porn gay cinema and that is why so much of contemporary gay genre movies are so dull this movie is intense and great tragedy the acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic it all keeps the film <UNK> and tense and passionate don't miss this if you can find it
<START> i am furious it has been a while since the last zombie movie i've watched so i was really looking forward to watching a good ol' gory zombie movie was a major disappointment a reasonable story but awful acting filming dialogue and nauseating clichés and punch lines i didn't even see the first one which is supposedly worse than this one now i am curious about how bad could that one have been the film is full of mistakes and goofs who on earth <UNK> <UNK> using a blood <UNK> why are these special forces who have been to hell and back fight like spoiled 6 year old girls we see <UNK> zombies who would take a bite at any chance they get then hundreds of them that wave their arms at our two heroes take them down to the ground then let them go without even a scratch i could go on and on about this but life is too short and i have already wasted a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the movie industry
<START> one of the best memories of my childhood should be on dvd it captured everything we grew up with in the seventies peace flower power and great <UNK> music the two <UNK> carol and paula were the definitive hippies with long hair <UNK> <UNK> and bell <UNK> they looked like a <UNK> ross ala the graduate and ali <UNK> ala love story respectively br br they made us happy with jokes from the daisy gave us lessons on being nice through conversations with the garden <UNK> and entertained us with music from their guitar they were the best and carol was also the original sandy in the original production of grease cool br br this show should be in a time capsule from the era that would also include the yellow submarine arrow to the sun and <UNK> free to be you me also sunshine and the point br br and last but not least that theme song see ya see ya hope you had a good good time ah ha glad we got to say good to ya hope we get get to see ya again see ya see ya glad that you could stay awhile ah ha hope we get see ya again see ya see ya
<START> i absolutely love this film everything about it it almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen the way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece very original and creative i related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some i'm really glad i ran across this movie if only there were more <UNK> like justin out there
<START> my <UNK> <UNK> was destroyed well i had one just like it drove the <UNK> and many of the chosen ones around manhattan for a few years br br that was a whole lot more entertaining than this movie i can tell you <UNK> what a bomb as in <UNK> go boom i also drove a lot more stars in my white <UNK> than appeared in this dud of a flick br br robert patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> played his part like a red <UNK> circus clown if he couldn't take it serious why should his audience the director should have kicked his butt off the set in the first hour of filming br br the dialog was written by 10 <UNK> <UNK> for 8 <UNK> <UNK> surprised there wasn't a whole lot more cracking up on the sets oh well i am a movie fanatic <UNK> you must take the bad to get to the good
<START> i just got back from after seeing it i'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he <UNK> <UNK> the film stone never has watched an <UNK> game in his life great cinematography give me a break the game montages were almost and 90 of the other shots in the film were close ups was there anything in this movie that wasn't brought up in north dallas forty br br aging star player check young hot shot check <UNK> check owner who doesn't get it check crazy off field behavior check br br also it's the <UNK> in dallas i e <UNK> or jan in an <UNK> stadium yet people sitting there in tank tops and shorts and what was with those lights were they playing in a japanese <UNK> theater or a sports stadium br br and the <UNK> shown in the game was laughable it's fourth 1 inside the <UNK> 30 dallas leads 35 <UNK> kick the <UNK> field goal not only would this had made sense football wise but you'd then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two point <UNK> hell tie the game w the extra point and stone could have made it an even 3 hours with <UNK> br br were the lame montages of old time football players supposed to be a tribute to the game give me a break br br and the script ugh more cliches than you can shake a stick at <UNK> there's another one br br was better than this movie by far br br 1 10 br br <UNK> this at all costs br br
<START> i rented this movie because i am a huge <UNK> fan i figured it couldn't be that bad boy was i wrong at the 15 minute mark i was the others to let me rip the dvd out and <UNK> it back to the rental store but they refused they <UNK> it had to get better br br they were wrong this movie was lacking everything the actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a <UNK> rock the plot was ridiculous and i was offended that hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it none of the characters <UNK> very well with each other ice t gives one of his worst performances here br br after watching footage of the wrong plane bad guys standing up to get shot and clips being <UNK> and missing everything i wanted to scream and bang my head on <UNK> the movie hit its <UNK> of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real <UNK> may say br br i didn't finish this movie and hated it i don't want to finish this movie this is slow suicide i could feel my cerebral planning to avenge the torture i put it through
<START> i have watch this movie almost every night that is was on hbo it is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater providing the <UNK> leading up to it was top scale i was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played <UNK> she is an outstanding actress of course my favorite actor is <UNK> howard he is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received <UNK> magazine did do a nice article on him giving him some of his due blue gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us they were from a similar town philadelphia <UNK> were they had to have their fun in the <UNK> and such i also like to say that <UNK> <UNK> is a incredible actor he has found his calling i've seen him in several movies where he has played a variety of roles from thug to doctor and he has the stuff overall please put blues on video for rental
<START> ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks this is one of those films it was <UNK> by the critics on it's release not least for the way it was <UNK> i caught it on tv last night and gave in to curiosity br br in the event it is what it says on the box no more nor less low level humour <UNK> very much in the on ' vein but with <UNK> language indeed it <UNK> back to the 60s 70s uk porn industry cheating <UNK> by promising real sex and not delivering spot the <UNK> that whole <UNK> era is lovingly <UNK> here but with modern cinematography br br it has the benefit of <UNK> crook the office pirates of the <UNK> and much more and also johnny vegas the chip shop girl is genuinely sexy beyond these unexpected <UNK> it does leave me wondering what happened to england junk food low paid work <UNK> <UNK> desperate lives as a bonus there are some nice shots of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> might find it informative about british attitudes and aspirations overall though i still feel disbelief that i sat through it
<START> i followed this entire series when i was a child in grade school by choice not because it was required for school i used to read the plays at the pace of the series the experience gave me a life long love for shakespeare and history it even gave me a bit of an acting bug although at an amateur level only whenever i read any of shakespeare's history plays the images that come to mind first are from this black and white production seen on a big furniture tv set with a rabbit ear <UNK> with all the ghosts and <UNK> that go with that br br although the sets were minimal if i remember correctly that was totally irrelevant because the acting was so good at the time i had no idea who any of the actors were now i see that many of them have become well known over the years i particularly enjoyed and hal whom i now see were played by sean connery and robert hardy i would <UNK> love to see this available in video especially since many of the plays are seldom performed and even fewer are available on video it would be valuable also as a document of mid 20th century <UNK> play production
<START> okay so <UNK> 4 is kind of bad and it doesn't really even have the <UNK> in it and the acting is bad the storyline is stupid but i forget to mention how funny this film is it is so campy and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy there are only 2 <UNK> in the movie and they don't really seem to be in relation with the <UNK> in the other film but they are pretty funny and funny thing that <UNK> graves returns for this one if you saw the first he was a character in that in my opinion this is better than the first there are some classic scenes and some classic lines one which is in a <UNK> store attention k mart <UNK> watch this if you enjoy bad movies it's so bad it is good and did i mention barbara <UNK> woods is hot
<START> this is another one of those <UNK> christian movies that hit you over the head with religion like a <UNK> you know you are in trouble when the setup of the story is completely ridiculous three men are flying to mexico to deliver <UNK> this makes no sense since the church is <UNK> and most <UNK> are catholic <UNK> and catholic <UNK> are not the same the catholic bible has books in it that are not in the <UNK> bible i also find it difficult to believe that <UNK> in mexico would not <UNK> <UNK> to them i can understand if they were going to a place where christianity is in the minority but mexico is far fetched if you cannot believe the setup of a story then you don't the rest of the story either a movie about religion can be entertaining but not this movie
<START> watched this film at a local festival the silver <UNK> international film festival florida what a lovely film a simple <UNK> morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions it neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change i wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language a real family film and the best british comedy film i've seen since billy elliot the film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of best film and best director ten out of ten
<START> the plot involves a new <UNK> franchise <UNK> that is moving across the street from <UNK> <UNK> so he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such sounds real exciting huh as for the rest of the film a lot of it involves the same material from the first film the people that work at <UNK> stand around talk loud and mouth off to each other and the customers once again cedric the entertainer was mildly funny but it is more like he's doing a stand up routine than anything to do with the movie and <UNK> is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money he's already shown that he will do the right thing in the end br br final verdict nothing new i don't recommend it unless you thought the first <UNK> was the best thing since <UNK> bread
<START> you know the story of <UNK> todd now most likely thanks to tim <UNK> recent movie you probably don't know it though from this take on the old tale from andy <UNK> that notorious sleaze <UNK> that gave al <UNK> and ted v <UNK> a run for their money br br it had to happen eventually in my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60's to the 80's i'm finally reviewing an andy <UNK> movie you see from 1964 to 1990 andy gave us many an exploitation and horror movie none of which was any good and barely watchable the <UNK> <UNK> is no exception br br there is dialog and well there is talk and that's one of the things you will find here lots and lots of talk the movie reaches almost <UNK> the hands of fate levels at times as you wait <UNK> for something to happen while i love cheap looking gore effects the violence is too few and far between and in spite of it's reputation the breast scene isn't that shocking br br i love cheap and sleazy exploitation as much as the next trash cinema <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> is the kind of bad that mst3k would tear apart mercilessly sadly <UNK> would die of aids in 1991 and if there is any movie of his i'd say i sort of like it would be the delirious the ghastly ones this is no ghastly ones though it's just bad
<START> there is only one reason this movie is watchable till <UNK> he is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible uwe boll please take up another career the special effects and action are acceptable all other aspects were very disappointing all i can say is that kevin smith an evening with talked about tim burton not ever reading the batman comics and it showed uwe boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about if you two ever want to know how it is done go see doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever some people may disagree but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at id had a lot to do with doom it doesn't seem like anyone at was even near this production
<START> this film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible and her sensible teenage daughter who is <UNK> adolescent <UNK> br br anywhere but here is an engaging film from beginning to the end both ann and adele are described well right at the start so we get to know how different their personalities are <UNK> inevitably ensue and they are <UNK> presented i find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances it is as if i am living their lives feeling what they are feeling br br susan sarandon gives another excellent performance in anywhere but here she is charismatic happy go lucky <UNK> warm and loving all at once i have always liked susan sarandon and i think she is grossly underrated br br anywhere but here is a captivating emotional journey
<START> together with the even more underrated the sun shines bright <UNK> master was one of ford's favorite films it is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative <UNK> well acted by members of ford's <UNK> including jane <UNK> alan <UNK> ward bond and harry carey jr like almost all of ford's films it is a <UNK> on freedom and community it is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of indians than in most of ford's movies ford for all his faults remains the supreme poet of american democracy
<START> i'm really amazed that this got an <UNK> on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars the 7 3 rating on imdb that's not so much of a surprise seeing the way imdb users have been voting recently i just can't get into a film in which the actual facts about its main character have clearly been distorted and not at all in a way to make the movie artistic but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring which it turns out actually makes it very boring for anyone who was expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of <UNK> khan the far fetched and over <UNK> <UNK> often echoes the likes of 300 a film that couldn't be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate but unlike 300 <UNK> takes itself seriously it's stoic seriousness mixed with the obvious inaccuracies is what makes it truly the most boring film i've seen this year possibly the most action or biopic movie i've ever seen the characters were <UNK> written honestly i doubt <UNK> khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film which is funny to me because if there's anything that i'd think should be changed for the sake of <UNK> it's making a boring person into an interesting person the romance between khan and is similarly boring simple and stupid also without giving anything away <UNK> contains the single stupidest scene i have seen in a long time where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development the film just <UNK> forward without any explanation it looked like something out of a saturday night live skit that parodies epic action movies with horrible pacing did i mention how seriously <UNK> takes itself meanwhile it drags like no film i've ever seen before even now i could swear it was three hours long about 45 minutes into it i checked the time being pretty certain that it was almost finished besides some pretty scenery and quality acting from <UNK> naturally <UNK> is honestly just a disaster it completely failed to entertain me or <UNK> me in anyway i would never give this film a second chance and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over <UNK> any day at least then i know what i'm getting unlike with <UNK> where the reviews and ratings led me to believe it was actually something worth seeing br br the saddest thing about how much i hated <UNK> is that i have friends who i know without a doubt would simply love it
<START> nothing to spoil here at all but this could be a spoiler so beware br br special effects were on the level of a video game about five years ago or perhaps of the original star trek the acting was just pathetic some cheesy looking blonde across the desert while a voice in the background <UNK> on and on and on this was the trek and <UNK> half that i actually made it through progress is interrupted by a few fights ships blow each other up for no real reason that is apparent again it's not that there is a real fight that you would expect from a movie more like a cheap video game <UNK> ing <UNK> ing ship explodes next ship apparently some of the ships are looking for the blonde here in the far future ships must be and because many of them pass directly <UNK> of the <UNK> dressed futuristic babe in black but never see her br br then there are a couple of choreographed fights that look like something put on by high school kids again the crude video game mentality is prominent the <UNK> shift to fight mode by flipping something on their <UNK> and a loud <UNK> voice echoes and flashes fight mode that must be a dandy design if you are trying to sneak up on somebody then you go to a big power station which looks just like a current day power line tower and plug in to charge back up lol i'm not kidding you can't make this stuff up it's like watching a freaking video game from about 2000 only the acting is better in the game br br more <UNK> then she shows up at the city lame sound trek gets even <UNK> here she gets into a fight with a <UNK> robot of the future who cannot hit her with his big gun even though she runs right in front of him about five feet in front of him obviously robots of the far future are about as useful as <UNK> <UNK> in a fight she throws sand in its eyes and beats it to death by throwing rocks at it <UNK> i was at about 95 of tolerance by that point my <UNK> <UNK> flashing red br br in the next scene she ends up <UNK> to a rocket with some rope i kid you not tied right to the outside of a rocket this is supposed to be an advanced form of <UNK> at that point i <UNK> br br this movie is an utter disgrace for a movie made at the present time just a freaking disgrace there was a <UNK> story but the movie distracted from it somebody <UNK> on about mother constantly br br i gave it a two because there were a few scenes which displayed some pretty nice artwork of a science fiction nature as background unfortunately the plot acting action cinematography and narrative distracted from this artwork and <UNK> it no kidding
<START> i watched about the first 30 40 minutes of this movie on television the other night and can agree that this is by far the worst of the series not any of it is funny even randy quaid can't save this mess eric <UNK> wasn't funny in n l euro vacation and he's even worse here the only funny scene is where they're at the airport and some guy dressed as santa walks by the camera yelling did anybody lose this as he holds up a <UNK> leg br br 1 2 a star out of
<START> made and released at the time when the internet was just becoming huge this is a storyline hitchcock would have loved br br sadly hitchcock wasn't around to make it and we're left with an occasionally suspenseful but mostly silly thriller that is held barely together by <UNK> intelligence br br it was released in 1995 but is already dated and the amount of mistakes and regarding computers must be seen to be believed and you don't even have to be a <UNK> com person to spot them
<START> honestly this movie is weak very weak only capital character can something she's work like on bad engine so if you like red haired <UNK> see that but better find picture of <UNK> as <UNK> and put it on <UNK> it will save of <UNK> well arnold also do his deal but it definitely not best his role other characters bad is not that word sword fights monsters ridiculous plot is really shame why was necessary rape she especially we don't see it br br anyway movie is weak though worse movies exist without main characters it would be just and if somebody even <UNK> it maybe
<START> based on the <UNK> of gypsy rose lee who painted a much more <UNK> picture of their mother than did her sister actress baby june havoc in her autobiography early havoc on which they shoot horses don't they was loosely based i saw <UNK> in the original broadway production of gypsy and she was great as mama rose but certainly more <UNK> than rose i was disappointed with <UNK> <UNK> portrayal in the <UNK> movie version an otherwise excellent actress russell was a very wooden substitute for <UNK> bette midler by contrast was better and more believable than <UNK> and i'd recommend her performance as the definitive one
<START> when commenting on this film one must realise that it is based on a true story and must therefore be reviewed for the quality and accuracy of it's portrayal of the events as well as its entertainment value it may well be implausible that jack shepherd should surrender twice to jack wild because wild had captured <UNK> none the less it happened it must also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced which explains why he relied upon tried and tested techniques there were occasions when did not have the confidence to follow the script as written the film would be better if he had and yes i used to have a copy of the script stanley <UNK> copy one of five which i returned recently to my father <UNK> the writer
<START> seriously i <UNK> really get why people here are bashing it i mean br br the idea of a killer snowman <UNK> havoc on a <UNK> island paradise is pretty absurd the good news is the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness br br especially in the second half of the film when the little killer <UNK> attack i laughed my ass off for example the put one of the little creeps into a <UNK> a la <UNK> 1 and mix it after that it <UNK> back into a <UNK> and <UNK> with a high pitched voice that was fun br br bottom line incredible movie rent it
<START> i just watched it last night and it was great i can see why some <UNK> have ill feelings towards it from a <UNK> fan and culture point of view but other than that i have no idea what's so negative about it the movie is great it has a lot of heart very inspiring and <UNK> to all ages great family movie they did a pretty good job considering that it was a budget movie i love movies based on true stories events i was raised around <UNK> all my life it is a great game but i was never really taken to it because please forgive me if i offend anyone nothing personal this is just how i saw it i thought their <UNK> are not as ruthless or hard the players are not as <UNK> and don't seemed as serious like other and it looked like it's all just muscle and <UNK> <UNK> each other etc but after watching forever strong i was like wow i was proud it did good things for <UNK> well it changed my view of <UNK> and also the new <UNK> i actually cried i am not even new <UNK> and i was proud of their culture didn't even know what the <UNK> meant until this movie the movie is not about <UNK> techniques or <UNK> it's not even about new zealand all blacks or the or etc mother of <UNK> <UNK> br br so to all you beautiful negative <UNK> you are missing the point i am sure if they had the means it would have been better the is in there because that was part of <UNK> <UNK> culture tradition or what ever you want to call it br br so any new members on this site such as myself please don't be put off by those negative comments see it for yourself must see movie there is a lot you can learn from this movie <UNK> of all ages it definitely makes you want to be a better person and be humble this movie reminded me of a lot of things that i already know and was raised with but i kinda lost along the way loved it happy reading and all the best br br
<START> i had my <UNK> about watching the return to <UNK> <UNK> after seeing and enjoying the original so much without tommy lee jones <UNK> his role as <UNK> call or <UNK> huston as clara i figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough upon viewing i can honestly say it's a worthy <UNK> the actors really make the show with jon voight rick <UNK> and oliver reed all <UNK> at their very best i admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first but definitely has it's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have anyone who still has <UNK> can rest assured that the return to <UNK> <UNK> succeeds in capturing the <UNK> of the original and will not disappoint do yourself a favor and check it out ol' gus would be proud
<START> it really isn't hard to understand this movie i watched it with no expectations and no knowledge of the story from the games i was completely blown away br br initially i wondered how most of the characters have some sort of super powers but it is called final fantasy i also wondered about <UNK> past but that was easy enough to look up in no way did these questions spoil the enjoyment of the movie though just the opposite it shows i kept thinking about the story long after seeing the movie br br it's one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen the music supports the movie completely the characters are incredible br br i want more
<START> i do not write reviews here often but i can not stand by and let other people suffer through this movie without a least trying to warn them this movie is horrible and it is not because i do not know what the director was trying to convey or i am too stupid to understand the plot this movie is horrible because of poor direction screen writing and acting this is the <UNK> of bad move making and the reason the film was direct to video it tries to be something like high tension hostel and with the <UNK> of some of those ideas but it just does not work i did not have high expectations or even medium ones going into the film but was still very disappointed it had potential to be very good with a nice setting and good idea for a film but it was wasted
<START> contains really bad spoilers so what can i say about this it's a really horrible and awful movie too much cgi and special effects you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is please at least go watch <UNK> and dragons which is another terrible pile of trash son of the mask makes <UNK> and dragons way better pure crap i hate this trash i would also like to say that <UNK> 2 was also a really stupid movie probably just as stupid as son of the mask 2 was just as fake as son of the mask and also contains way too much cgi br br anyway yeah this was a bad bad really bad movie just please avoid it do not recommend this to no one please its just way too ridiculous makes no sense and really bad plot the baby on his dad was just lame
<START> as a <UNK> pre baby <UNK> born in 1944 in los angeles thereby having the dubious distinction of having been alive while hitler was still <UNK> involved in his last great offensive but also with our president <UNK> still <UNK> fighting the offensive this was one of the most important first films of my young life having the opportunity to see it in re release several years after the 1946 opening a common studio <UNK> in those years answered even to my very young mind oh so many questions i had being surrounded by our returning vet heroes <UNK> in all the many of william <UNK> of subtle multi plots intentionally not surrounding mini or sub plots in all their colors and shades of intensity did more than anything else i can recall to provide to me some semblance of reason and rational explanation of what had been going on all around me in real life my personal experience <UNK> being a new and different angle when looking at this classic film
<START> if you are in to bad movies for the entertainment of witnessing bad movies bad acting bad production etc aka mystery science theater 3000 quality you will love pacific <UNK> jim brown will be forever remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game as an actor he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game i am not sure who <UNK> was but i am hoping he was 15 or 16 years old when he directed this perhaps he may have been the next spielberg in the making because if he was a grown man directing this a 15 or 16 year old could have done better the basis or plot for the movie probably had some historical merit and maybe even <UNK> accurate but the actual film may be one of worst movies made in american film history i kept waiting for lee marvin william <UNK> or charles bronson to pop in to somehow save whatever face was left of this film i would have loved to have been at the red carpet black tie <UNK> for the hollywood opening when this movie <UNK> as this movie had to have many a viewer laughing and cringing under their breath it is on the dime dvd <UNK> now look for it for entertainment value this movie is so bad it is too good to pass up
<START> it's <UNK> day and we decided to stay in have a nice dinner and watch this movie on tcm instead of going out we're in our 40's 50's love romance and are both <UNK> but this movie just bombed for us it's hard to imagine that it was nominated for oscars etc but i guess that was then the cinematography was beautiful but for the most part the movie as a whole is terribly dated jennifer jones' character made so many references to her being that we started counting and after a while we were <UNK> every time she said it add to that the theme song played <UNK> throughout the film and we couldn't wait for it to be over so we could watch the evening news
<START> if you feel <UNK> as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on tv try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight his face is bland all throughout the movie and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes this is way far from a real love story get the spelling right <UNK> it is not <UNK> or and is complete with him doing a <UNK> da dance auto <UNK> fight scenes <UNK> getting imprisoned <UNK> accused of murder he fleeing from prison etc if you want a good laugh there is nothing like this one especially the scenes where he <UNK> in <UNK> if you despise the <UNK> and want to know out of curiosity what two hours of <UNK> can do to you then don't miss this movie br br i couldn't stop laughing from the beginning till the very end the only saving grace that this movie has are the cinematography locations and a couple of the songs even then until you are a die hard <UNK> fan avoid this movie at all costs
<START> i had been wanting to see an american werewolf in paris for a long time because i loved its predecessor but this film didn't impress me as much as an american werewolf in london actually to be quite honest it didn't impress me at all br br tom everett scott and his dude pals are wandering paris and in a preposterous stunt off the <UNK> tower <UNK> wolf babe julie <UNK> from death before you've time to work out if the constant <UNK> and <UNK> dialogue is meant to be the stuff of comedy a full moon has hit and the <UNK> are being chased by dreadful cgi werewolves down <UNK> <UNK> br br the script is <UNK> poor the actors were made to make this film they're horrible performances match the status of the movie from start to end this movie is never entertaining engaging or even slightly watchable i had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my dinner to be quite honest br br the action scenes aren't exciting the jokes aren't funny and the werewolves aren't scary in short miss out or be haunted forever br br i rate an american werewolf in paris 2 out of 10
<START> when it comes to those eerie and uncanny little crime films the sorts that <UNK> around characters that are <UNK> on <UNK> and inhabit equally <UNK> surroundings and additionally carry that <UNK> and bleak feel thanks to some pretty <UNK> cinematography and some very black comedy dead bodies is the sort of film paul wishes he could make alas the <UNK> and <UNK> gangster no 1 as well as the equally all over the shop but interesting exercise in <UNK> mixed with realism effort entitled the acid house are the only ones of his we've got to go on so far dead bodies is robert <UNK> piece based on a derek <UNK> script a film that the line between psychological horror and neo noir <UNK> elements of crime and terror with themes linked to morality and unnatural obsessive <UNK> br br british based crime efforts carry that <UNK> and distorted feel like witnessing <UNK> nightmare and having front row seats in the process his films are able to disgust is some areas and <UNK> in others what with their outlandish and all over the place approach they carry a very dream like sensibility despite being grounded in a very realistic down <UNK> <UNK> looking world  the real world with as much an emphasis on the horror and the terror of the situations his characters <UNK> than anything else dead bodies is a film that <UNK> both some pretty harrowing character driven situations as well as a brief inclusion of a study of a delicate psychological mindset only here the film <UNK> both the <UNK> of its characters the terror of the scenarios they find themselves in and the questions of morality that <UNK> much better br br dead bodies is effective and rather simplistic without ever feeling like manipulative its suggestive and knowing tendency to want to hammer home exactly what people are thinking and feeling does not detract from the experience early on we meet tommy <UNK> scott a young <UNK> whose girlfriend jean davis <UNK> him his life and the screen whenever she's on for the brief time that she is the point as to the fact his situation of living in a less than <UNK> house with a job <UNK> shelves and a partner he doesn't get on with at all well is put across in a distinct manner as is the manner in which the audience are given distinct <UNK> to dislike jean what with the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> attitudes she so clearly possesses later on the film will <UNK> rather obviously on a police <UNK> face as <UNK> and tensions rise in what is clearly a cheap and easy way to tell the watching audience that our hero is not quite out of trouble just yet br br but compare this to gangster no 1 in which such is the episodic and misguided approach applies to the material that a vital vital plot point <UNK> when a character is spotted leaving a building by someone else out on a <UNK> in a scene set several months after the previous one the feeling isn't as grounded nor fulfilling dead <UNK> set up is dominated by kay <UNK> jean a would be femme fatale just <UNK> to pick a fight of some sort but just not really being able to find one she has lead tommy jumping through rings going there doing this and that without tommy ever really <UNK> in the manner he could <UNK> because he is controlled by her promises of sex the beginning builds a certain amount of tension because of <UNK> <UNK> reaction to what's going on and it <UNK> in a distinct release when the initial incident happens and jean dies br br if the set up is simple enough then that's one thing but the <UNK> of the project is the manner in which tommy decides to rid jean of his hands by <UNK> her without <UNK> anyone of her death bar a best friend things <UNK> when it <UNK> there was a second dead body in the exact same place tommy buried jean with <UNK> <UNK> and general trouble the all round ingredients of the day it is at this point the film <UNK> the lines between noir and horror indeed tommy <UNK> rather a large ominous spooky and even gothic house which he shares with an elder relative whom <UNK> the upper areas of said house this evokes memories of hitchcock's 1960 film psycho and <UNK> set up that he has with his mother and where she's <UNK> it is additionally no coincidence this would be place of horror is the setting for unfortunate demise br br the placing of a dead body right in the hands of the hapless male lead in order for it to act as the initial incident is a classic set up for any noir from 1945 film <UNK> right up to a more recent and more contemporary compared to dead bodies 2006 film entitled big nothing what this film unfolds into is a twisted rather unpredictable and quite frightening tale of genre <UNK> and mind games told under a palette of distinctly <UNK> visuals the voice overs and the <UNK> on the fine line that the lead does for most of the film between right and wrong aid in pushing it into a realm of the neo noir if we consider the fact that the lead is essentially innocent and his murder charges are unfair then that's one thing but his attitudes towards jean initially saw him act without thought and his covering up of her death is the anti <UNK> for dropping the murder charges dead bodies is taught entertaining to watch without ever feeling exploitative and provides a consistent tone for the rather nasty physical and psychological content being explored
<START> clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands but given uwe <UNK> track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce br br the first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness even the horrible one liners delivered by <UNK> joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre br br you will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point you've already passed all the highlights and you will have <UNK> yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history br br next enter absolute rubbish talent the leading man has the same amount of charisma that you will find in garden slug br br there is an awkward bit of contrived romance thrown in this feels so wrong that you can only <UNK> why this scene was <UNK> up in the first place normally the genre uses <UNK> of romance and nudity to <UNK> some humanity and sympathy into otherwise cardboard cut out characters here it <UNK> on all <UNK> br br the effects are bad and the action unbelievably boring where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budget <UNK> here it just seems like everything was spent on <UNK> br br there are in fact no redeeming features here not even the it's so bad it is almost good applies it's just bad and in a bad way br br our hero questions the leading <UNK> about the night they spent together and how she would rate him she gives him 2 out of 10 i give the whole affair 1 i'd have gone for 0 if that were possible br br don't waste your time on this <UNK> there is plenty of crap cinema out there which <UNK> this ridiculous <UNK> in the jungle br br oh and finally the movie has little to nothing at all to do with the popular game far cry at best it is extremely loosely based on it br br horrible move along
<START> i had never heard of this film until it came to dvd i was immediately intrigued by everything about it the actors the title the cover and especially the author arthur miller you can't go wrong with him can you yep i haven't read the novel but i'm going to guess it was a lot better than the film i had high hopes for this movie i love macy and dern and it looked interesting unfortunately this film never really rises above cookie cutter messages about racism and <UNK> if you've never seen any other films that deal with this subject or if you never knew that america was <UNK> on <UNK> then maybe this film will wow you others will probably find it predictable stale and overall bland
<START> this film without doubt is one of the worst i have seen it was so boring that i simply could not wait for it to end i talked my girlfriend into watching it after this site had good reviews and after even 30 mins in she looked at me as if to say your nuts the scenery was as boring as the film with nothing but driving around in the car looking at the wind blowing bits of bush around the acting was un inspiring and the film was simply a waste of what have been a good idea into a waste of a br br guy pierce should have stuck to <UNK> as at least he washed his hair all he done was talk on his phone but yet sold nothing as a salesman he would have been <UNK> weeks before his girlfriend once in <UNK> ugly should have remained dancing on the bar as at least she looked hot in that br br the guy who played vincent those who watched know was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have drove to his house and hit him with a bit of 4 by 2 br br i do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it i actually want people to watch this to suffer the torture i went through
<START> i was watching tv one day with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of going <UNK> believe me when i say it was enough to get a good judgment of the film the first scene that i saw was the monkey the kid the fat guy and the black guy who looked like dave flying around in a crop <UNK> thousands of feet in the air while everyone else was <UNK> about the journey the monkey seemed to be on some kind of drug <UNK> where he kept shouting something that <UNK> the english word faster they then landed on a twenty yard long <UNK> in africa after a heart felt goodbye where the monkey cried <UNK> the villains of the film appeared they were <UNK> complete ass in their vintage <UNK> when the evil monkey took an air jordan leap form the <UNK> onto the boat that was <UNK> away a clean 40 <UNK> away and made them sink their beautiful car into the pacific ocean after seeing this film i have a new purpose in life to find the midget who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a <UNK> pen
<START> if one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture one would <UNK> a bright future for harold lloyd unlike his <UNK> he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the <UNK> of the music hall or vaudeville circuit he had a good voice which matched his image moreover from <UNK> on his silent films had <UNK> sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience e g the bell sequence at the fall <UNK> from the <UNK> and the monkey sequence in the kid brother yet <UNK> sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of welcome danger had lloyd blamed his fall on many <UNK> sources but never realized that the glass character's enemy was not sound but the great depression pre depression audiences <UNK> with optimism may have <UNK> for this ambitious go <UNK> in whom they saw their surrogate depression audiences <UNK> him as the person likely to on their <UNK> and throw them in the <UNK> <UNK> this problem of character choice is <UNK> perception as an <UNK> glad <UNK> sincerity of course is a <UNK> <UNK> but it is <UNK> that lloyd despite his own tragic upbringing could never play a convincing down and outer perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> fails for these reasons but it alone suffers from the revelation of <UNK> pro fascist agenda many film <UNK> believe that lloyd was <UNK> to make this film because he saw the <UNK> of <UNK> as a <UNK> bent on <UNK> the rich and soft on crime we should remember that he was not alone in this feeling demille had directed this day and age a pro police state drama the previous year we should also remember that america was <UNK> by tax <UNK> and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it <UNK> suffered because it treated <UNK> lightly in a comedy and because its release was particularly ill timed given the events in germany in that year the production code of 1934 would ultimately <UNK> the <UNK> of vigilante justice and <UNK> the rule of <UNK> law <UNK> as it might be the ideal of the <UNK> <UNK> the good <UNK> all powerful leader who brings about a <UNK> once freed of the <UNK> and <UNK> on this dates to classical <UNK> for this reason <UNK> <UNK> fear laughter even though it acts as a safety <UNK> ironically the mere existence of <UNK> a film which the <UNK> experience of the country of its origin shows that america was secure enough to accept criticism one sees no parallel criticism in hitler's germany <UNK> or <UNK> italy but can one laugh at the <UNK> humor of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film is <UNK> to the right and might have been written by dr <UNK> himself if he'd had a sense of humor of course it <UNK> an alternative history in which a chosen one <UNK> order and lost honor by any means necessary and does so with good nature and fun impending <UNK> approached by the left is of course <UNK> the great dictator this latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a <UNK> <UNK> actual persona and events the great dictator produces few laughs today because it under <UNK> the extent of human evil but it succeeds despite its <UNK> and inappropriate <UNK> because it has the distinct advantage of being <UNK> by history lloyd however should be credited for two things first he neither made any further pro fascist films nor produced any subsequently <UNK> pro allied films during the war second he never sold <UNK> to television the post 1945 world had seen the face of <UNK> and it wasn't amusing
<START> there are frames in this film that could be <UNK> paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds the humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this fifties film and makes <UNK> the old story line of the <UNK> that becomes a star the can can number at the end seems realistic and exciting but not over the top as in an american dance sequence
<START> i was able to see anywhere but here last night as a free sneak preview i absolutely loved the film i was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother daughter relationship there was definitely a connection between adele a and ann i think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both susan sarandon and natalie portman sarandon was just the right actress to portray adele and after leaving the theater i could not think of another actress in the role portman was also excellent as ann she brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that i don't think any other teenage actress could i think it would the academy of motion picture arts and <UNK> should give credit where it is due and <UNK> both sarandon and portman for awards in the actress and supporting actress categories it would be a shame if they were overlooked
<START> frank <UNK> steals my heart in everything he has ever been in i love watching him i was 10 <UNK> old 1979 when i seen him for the first time i eagerly <UNK> each and everything he'll be acting in hopefully one day i can see him in person he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong he is very attractive even now at <UNK> he is absolutely stunning in my opinion he is the greatest actor <UNK> ever seen i <UNK> him in dracula along with a lot of other girls out there and in god created woman house of d jason and the <UNK> and many more i thought he was genius can't wait to see him in good night and good luck
<START> no just no that's all that needs to be said br br summary a random guy is in a <UNK> for some reason i'm not sure but it's his duty to run around inside the next great thriller br br a five year old could make a better movie just filming an or even just grass growing seriously br br you can't say it has bad acting because there is no acting you can't say it has bad writing because it has no writing you can't say it has bad cinematography because there is no cinematography you can't say it's a bad movie because there is no movie if you don't believe me go watch it just don't say i never warned you
<START> i first started watching the outer limits back in 95 when i was 10 and it just blew my mind every week with each episode every episode had a twist and each week i couldn't wait for the next how the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me this show manages to teach us about life <UNK> alien and human encounters and an insight into more of the <UNK> and how it affects the people what really makes this a good show are the characters in each episode they really show emotion and are really good actors what you'll also notice each week is an actor actress you'll know from a past show which is pretty neat in its own way br br if you wanna chill out and sit back with a good sci fi show then the outer limits is for you
<START> having not read the original book or seen the earlier film and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film i came to this film with an open mind br br it's really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film because the whole thing seems so confused it seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film but what that is remains completely obscure br br the effects were fantastic and very well judged the idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out however it was downhill from here br br all of the time travel seems to have only the <UNK> connection to the quest that was set out at the start there are some nice ideas but they seem to be isolated <UNK> that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost at one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon br br when arrives in <UNK> a d the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the and while it seems clear that there is something to find out what it is remains annoyingly <UNK> this is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story so many things happen that there should be an explanation for but there is no discovery i really really wanted to know what the film was getting at what there was to <UNK> but to no <UNK> having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point it seems like there has been a very half hearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so <UNK> and <UNK> down that the meaning and context is completely lost br br just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction and becomes a mindless action film without any real action it is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film by now countless significant things are happening without any explanation fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason the film comes to an abrupt end as decides to stay with the br br in summary after a good start the film is very disappointing too much time is spent on adventures before arriving with the however the worst part of the film is what i think is the most important part the setting up of the situation with the the whole point is completely missed and this <UNK> the rest of the film after this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place with so many things happening without explanation the film just seems to get lost and lose direction however the finale where decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all br br ultimately the whole film seemed like a collection of <UNK> incidents the meaning and context was lost although the <UNK> hole where it should have been was very obvious what was so frustrating about it all though was that there was clearly so much potential here it wasn't by any means a bad film it just so easily could have been so much better the start was very promising the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on <UNK> and experience with the could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked and had there not been such a temptation to dumb down and <UNK> i just wish i had a time machine so that i could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made
<START> films about the mundane are often the most interesting of all films to me in the hands of an insightful artist who <UNK> all the twisted little details of the mundane the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing and i love the french cinema br br this film was about the mundane it didn't have a much of a plot it was just characters who lived in a town very normal people and stuff just happened but it wasn't very interesting stuff and it wasn't examined very <UNK> the film did capture a bit of a mood but it wasn't a particularly captivating mood and while i can't think of much that the film did specifically wrong it failed on just about every level to do anything right br br there were a lot of characters in this film a lot of them kind of looked alike so it was hard to figure out who was who and what were their relations to one another i don't mind putting some effort into understanding a film or even watching an especially complex film more than one time to iron out the details but this one was a puzzle not worth the solving for me br br the only good thing i can really say about this film is that the cinematography was pleasant <UNK> not brilliant but pleasant the camera often captured some nice <UNK> type shots but it rarely found the really interesting little details br br i've seen a handful of not so good films so far at the seattle international film festival but this was the only one that failed to get any applause when the credits rolled i <UNK> a big collective sigh of relief when the film was finally over but i suppose there are probably some people out there who would like it br br 4 10
<START> i bought this movie for about 2 5 dollars at a local flea market i thought that with the cast present in this movie ice t rob lowe mario van <UNK> are all ok it would be pretty good boy was i wrong this movie annoyed the hell out of me almost every scene drags on too long the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie the rest is no either my guess is when they finished the movie they only had 30 minutes of film so they made everything last longer br br conclusion the current 1 9 rating here on imdb is right on the money this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen go watch some paint dry for 1 5 hour instead of watching this br br if you want to see some better movies made by this director watch with christopher <UNK> ice t or with charlie sheen instead
<START> i walked into blockbuster to watch some good old fashion action movies so i <UNK> around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter sandra <UNK> an action movie with sandra <UNK> in it and it's rated r <UNK> although i will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like <UNK> then i was sold sadly sandra really is not in this movie her role is minor <UNK> kidnapped girlfriend she is in fifth place on the actors listing for shakes apparently this was her first movie role and after watching this movie i figured as much sandra is the only living human in this movie everyone else might as well be a zombie in a b horror flick this movie <UNK> me saying sandra was the lead i fell for it like <UNK> from <UNK> to the <UNK> when marty yells what's that god i wish i watched that instead of this br br sandra is the only bright side of this movie every time she is on camera it is like she is picking up shock <UNK> and yelling clear to get this movies going but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries more on sandra later br br the movie is dull very dull think of the <UNK> moment in your life then imagine living through that moment for <UNK> minutes for me it is this movie this movie even somehow makes gun fights and bullet time effects boring so boring that elephant <UNK> are put to shame and this movie's idea of bullet time is a close up of an <UNK> in slow motion which <UNK> you as the <UNK> spitting out of it represent each second of your life as it slowly <UNK> away and i knew i was watching a bad movie because i found myself fast <UNK> through the action the plot there was a plot music even by 80s <UNK> standards is bad but at least it's the one thing that kept me awake acting sandra <UNK> was good and <UNK> moving on is it any good since it is rated r no unless r stands for <UNK> <UNK> fest br br and it is really 80s cliché when a movie opens with an <UNK> view of a city <UNK> guitar <UNK> or power ballet and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> both of which this movie <UNK> at least this movie <UNK> what era it's from which was unnecessary since <UNK> hair was screaming 1980s and a movie gets really ham <UNK> when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box which you respond to sadly saying that is probably the most action that poor <UNK> ever got another hammy moment is at the beginning when some secret agent dude <UNK> a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die all that scene needed was the mario death <UNK> or maybe <UNK> sound effects but <UNK> might have <UNK> br br and it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other better movie icons before the big gun scene da hero is found standing in a boxing ring anyone sporting a leather <UNK> not jones' too with an ominous <UNK> behind him terminator the 2nd before <UNK> t 1000 what is really really sad is that people on youtube or can film better quality videos with a crappy <UNK> no less then this movie i'm serious most rant videos recorded with bad audio and <UNK> picture are more entertaining then this movie i cannot even call this movie by it's given name for it's very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment a freaking <UNK> against human rights the only bright <UNK> in this dark abysmal <UNK> is <UNK> career started taking off thanks to this movie but oh sandra why did you have to be in such a nightmare the paycheck better been worth it the dvd also <UNK> you with a little back story on sandra as an extra seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs <UNK> little <UNK> br br i don't have much experience with bad films but i know bad when i see it i could <UNK> back from <UNK> and <UNK> with a good old campy bruce willis comedy but not even bruce could cheer me up after this movie i have yet to see any ed wood or uwe boll but i think i'm <UNK> for them now for i can't even <UNK> a movie worse then gag
<START> when i sat down in the cinema to see this i was expecting to see a sort of stylish tongue in cheek action film which had been implied by the trailers however it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more br br normally i don't <UNK> of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible for instance this film tries to mix action with comedy romance <UNK> and gritty seriousness all at once most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films just look at batman forever but i was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they pulled it off br br the end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature however the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes robert <UNK> and <UNK> lee miller pull of a brilliant double act and ken does a excellent villain this mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch br br however the big let down here for me is that in having 'the gentleman there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in and there were few belly laughs okay so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent british films ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of hollywood's efforts
<START> <UNK> was painful to sit through although irene <UNK> does a good job with the heavy handed script richard pompous and <UNK> role is brutal the passage of time has not treated the character of <UNK> as well as other racial and religious notions well although the movie is somewhat <UNK> on the roles of women and the <UNK> of native americans the editing is especially weak this is without a doubt the worst of all the best pictures
<START> i don't see why everyone is bombing this so much i thought it was a great fun time that sadly wasn't popular enough to be that famous believe me i have seen much much worse than this if you want a bad movie see blood shack or the alien dead or something so what this is normal slasher fare but better than most and it is watchable this movie also has one of the best <UNK> i've heard some of the music is very suspenseful and the death scenes are cool too we see a very bloody body in a <UNK> with the words sold written in blood on the mirror and we also get a cool double beating by a toilet with <UNK> attached to it this was a good fun 80s slasher that's definitely worth your time despite what others say about it
<START> my take on the ending bobby died at the hands of his step father mike had tried as he may to get bobby out only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly bobby died mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind on how bobby left mike made a plane that flew bobby out children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive br br was also great seeing my old <UNK> area we called it san jose <UNK> and i lived right around where these house were filmed it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses not studios it was my kitchen bedroom and living room and those hills we use to <UNK> them as kids looking down on our little valley seeing glimpses of the bay was a real nostalgia trip for me
<START> the first time i watched it was when it came out 1994 and the last time i watched it was just before writing this review it still makes me laugh my brains out after all these years it dose not disappoint truly the <UNK> bollywood comedy ever made this is one indian movie which deserves its place in the imdb top 250 <UNK> khan and salman khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles the thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing the jokes are refreshing and not cheap this is one film truly ahead of its time if you haven't seen it yet go watch it now
<START> if you loved the early 60's version of the time machine don't waste your time as with last year's the planet of the apes this has been <UNK> and not for the better and just as with planet its lead actor is woefully miscast and <UNK> guy <UNK> a terrific actor of great range is all wrong for this role giving a one note performance that <UNK> zero sympathy he's so <UNK> and serious and lacking in awe of the supposedly amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he's experiencing them worse yet whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of david spade and <UNK> a handsome actor here he is <UNK> <UNK> which is believe it or not a major distraction frankly the man looks <UNK> ill and is photographed <UNK> he shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else's sadly even with a proper leading man this movie doesn't stand a chance for it is <UNK> <UNK> with both a totally inept director whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized and a screenplay that is utterly inferior scattered and at times incoherent not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film for the single fact that there is nothing in the way of character development in the original you got to know the so therefore you felt for them and felt their terror of the here as the movie <UNK> several times they are nothing but sheep and act <UNK> unless you're a member of <UNK> scared sheep are hardly the stuff of entertainment br br samantha does as well as possible in her movie debut but like everyone else in this mess most especially jeremy <UNK> if he's the leader of the who look like rejects from the mummy returns why then does he look like edgar <UNK> long lost brother is completely wasted also wasted was the money spent on the endless <UNK> effects which <UNK> the <UNK> spent on the film they are uniformly lackluster obvious and unconvincing and then there's the look of the film poorly photographed its art direction and sets are just there and its costumes are typical in design there isn't an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen most of all it isn't even fun the filmmakers use the now <UNK> orlando jones as comic relief but as usual jones is irritating and just how does his <UNK> driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity br br all in all this is an empty lifeless dull <UNK> and confused affair didn't they already remake planet of the apes at least that had the fortune of some strong performances br br spoiler the final insult beyond a head <UNK> terrible not to mention convenient ending not only do they barely feature the changing dress store figures they make even the time machine itself an <UNK> <UNK> glass n bore if the sopranos had a time machine this is exactly what it would look like pathetic
<START> fantastic madonna at her finest the film is funny and her acting is brilliant it may have been made in the 80's but it has all the qualities of a modern hollywood block buster i love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any <UNK> person within a matter of minutes fantastic
<START> well acted yes very well i must say even though i don't speak nice cinematography but the script is lame really lame a predictable soap opera in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen ok maybe the ending isn't as predictable but is it any good it is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already and forget about the day after br br i just got a note from imdb saying that my comment was not long enough that's really sad because i have no idea of what else to say about this movie which actually says a a lot about it don't you think the thing is it has no soul and no originality compare this movie with <UNK> or riff <UNK> shot more than ten years ago or the extraordinary recently shot the child it's sad to see that this is a much worse film
<START> this movie is not as bad as some say it is <UNK> i think it s more enjoyable than the original maybe that s why some people hate it as much <UNK> they dont want to admit it s a good not great movie br br most if not all fx were done by c g i which i <UNK> t mind at all <UNK> it was an enjoyable movie phil chris was in my opinion the best guy in the movie julie <UNK> was rather attractive she brought the <UNK> to the movie br br there were a lot of <UNK> in the movie which i thought were good this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say <UNK> killer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> s movie thats to name but two br br this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i ll get the original at some point maybe i have only one complaint and that is phil chris should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine br br rating for this movie 8 10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there br br
<START> i normally don't try and second guess a crime thriller but <UNK> was just entirely too predictable samuel l jackson playing the character tom along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film however that was about it without even thinking i knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes i had already figured out who the killer was rather then <UNK> myself and having seen several films that make a i watched to its <UNK> what a disappointment i was right from the beginning br br the casting of characters was a good as well as the acting from jackson and harris except for eva <UNK> from the starting gate she didn't play a believable character in <UNK> to the script and this ruined the entire plot too soon maybe this was a directing <UNK> or just weakness in the story itself her role as ann should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her this would've made the build up a bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic nevertheless <UNK> is watchable not memorable i've seen episodes of <UNK> that were more thrilling then this
<START> if you like bad movies and you must to watch this one here's a good one not quite as funny as the first but much lower quality a must see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing
<START> yes they finally got it down to perfection what a great idea a refreshing exploitation epic for generation x whether they know it or not after disasters like sgt <UNK> and getting screwed by blockbuster our hero lloyd kaufman just decided to go for it stop <UNK> to <UNK> and let troma be all the troma it can be lloyd would make this one the most <UNK> outlandish and downright hilarious troma movie yet this time lloyd takes shakespeare's love story turns it inside out it and adds that long lost entertainment value it was always lacking entertainment value such as the narrator debbie <UNK> the cook joe the fat guy and of course brutal <UNK> and toilet humor <UNK> and juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story and the crown jewel of the troma universe br br years ago in <UNK> n j business partners monty <UNK> and cap <UNK> start a film company called <UNK> films which would produce supposedly <UNK> soft core films monty considers cap his friend but cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company on paper and in books it appears that monty gave away his life's work for free fast forward to mid 90's manhattan we have two families who are extremely <UNK> with one another it's to the point that they're just looking for a reason to take a <UNK> or preferably a life monty has a son <UNK> nephew benny they with their friend murray <UNK> who's just a little too excited about all the carnage <UNK> war on the incestuous <UNK> except monty he's too drunk to care like in the original there is a confusing situation leading to <UNK> falling for daughter who he has never met or never even knew about unfortunately cap is a sadistic <UNK> who not unlike dad has a thing for the bottle and this would of course lead to <UNK> little <UNK> being physically and emotionally abused and <UNK> and kept in a <UNK> cage off and on depending on how foul of a mood cap is in cap is also forcing his <UNK> daughter to marry london <UNK> a <UNK> butcher who would make just about anyone uneasy with or without the <UNK> with all these <UNK> the young lovers feel that <UNK> would be the best decision but how will this effect the big <UNK> it might or might not go a little something like the original but <UNK> out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen you'll never see it coming br br the one with leo is downright sleep inducing compared to <UNK> juliet but if watered down over directed big budget hollywood garbage is what you've been <UNK> to go for then by all means go for it but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful something that really packs a punch and doesn't follow the normal movie pattern and if you happen to have a rather <UNK> sense of humor then you just might not hate this movie <UNK> and juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream full blast exploitation with as much mean spirited humor as anything from a young john waters along with some <UNK> acting <UNK> and juliet <UNK> a <UNK> score which includes the legendary <UNK> and not to mention much <UNK> from james <UNK> that really brought this one together for more <UNK> from james <UNK> check out and for more excellence from lloyd kaufman check out his next vision terror <UNK> <UNK> and juliet is jaw <UNK> priceless exploitation for the 90's brought to us by the one and only king of the b movies <UNK> lloyd 10 10
<START> in da <UNK> is the first <UNK> of jeff daniels writing and directing talents br br i've seen worse <UNK> but this one isn't that great br br in da <UNK> starts off like as a decent parody of this part of american culture as we follow jeff daniels on the eve of deer hunting season 1989 he is getting close to the record of oldest to never bag a buck br br the film takes places in the upper <UNK> of <UNK> and has all the normal cliche characters but there is a warmth there that tells you this isn't being mean spirited br br well <UNK> is heading off to the deer camp and before his wife <UNK> norris <UNK> gives him a native american <UNK> his lucky hat and two forms of <UNK> you probably don't want to know about br br anyway she is really the only one who believe in him he finally gets to the camp where his dad <UNK> is waiting and his brother joey <UNK> is soon to show br br okay let's fast forward this in here there are some laughs a few moments when i <UNK> a loud but most of the jokes here are used a few to many times br br but the biggest draw back is the spiritual native american happenings just when you settle in with the characters these strange things occur but the special effects are so cheap all it is is a big flash of light and then head quickly <UNK> back in forth br br and the ending well it is worthless br br the move itself wasn't bad the quirky character and fun parody were good but it should've stayed at that instead of having stupid spiritual <UNK> that look like rejected scenes from some demon possession movie br br i give in da <UNK> a 4 5 out of 10
<START> yes thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie the acting is below average and the special effects are horrible in fact the worst i have ever seen it is a very low budget movie there is no way this movie will can scare you it has no creepy or scary moments mr bone eater was more of a funny creature for me it could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget the movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie lol i would name this movie the time eater <UNK> i am sure you would have a lot of better movies etc to watch still watch it if 1 you have nothing else to watch 2 you get to watch it for free not worth renting at all
<START> it is fitting that the title character in sydney white is defined from the beginning of the film by her <UNK> because the film like the character tends to begin every scene with a well meant but inappropriate statement then inadvertently making it worse and leaving the viewer in total confusion br br this scenario gets old quick now imagine a hour and a half of this throw on the most predictable storyline imaginable add some vague snow white and the seven <UNK> references and amanda <UNK> <UNK> in wide eyed <UNK> and you have sydney white for more of my review http www <UNK> com items sydney white review
<START> this film is hard to knock it follows in the tradition of pulp fiction yet succeeds further by <UNK> its own unique style the cast is awesome the script is great and things like the odd pulp fiction <UNK> time <UNK> is done brilliantly i particularly like how the images provided in flash back <UNK> dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time when it is one of the <UNK> criminals everything is flashy and cool but when it is the hero's <UNK> everything is <UNK> and disgusting br br this is an awesome film and so i am extremely annoyed to find that i cant buy it anywhere
<START> my companions were <UNK> to find that this movie was a documentary it was so funny it seemed scripted yet it gives a stirring picture of real life in the indie film life we felt moved to purchase <UNK> and wanted to meet mark and mike as college students this film gave us a much needed glimpse of real life
<START> i have seen this movie but not in a single sitting what happens it that it is playing on the tv i watch for a few minutes find that i have take all that i can take and then leave the room during those few minutes i do not laugh once experience no pleasure in what i am viewing and find myself more depressed that angry interestingly i am told the psychological states are <UNK> that is one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time this movie <UNK> that theory br br i think part of the problem is that i spent nearly ten years in chicago so as i am watching the scenes i am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus i am clearly bringing a lot of my <UNK> to the piece it is entirely possible i am willing to <UNK> that if you are not a chicago <UNK> you will find the piece amusing if so i envy you br br and yet john hughes set his films in chicago and those movies worked for me i think the difference is that hughes was a first rate writer i think it obvious he knew how to <UNK> balance his situations as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable in a comedy as distinguished from a farce this balance vital and it is not easy to achieve if it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to <UNK> as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear in adventures in <UNK> it doesn't i hated those characters br br there is a difference profound and real between sympathetic and simply pathetic br br for me every scene in this movie is a <UNK> there is no humor no humanity no people one can recognize just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to <UNK> themselves from screaming them out certain that finally hilarity will ensue this time for sure it's like watching the antics of very bad comedians it's embarrassing and after a while usually at the point when i get up and leave i start to feel pity for all concerned which is a kind of emotional connection i suppose elizabeth <UNK> is terrible she doesn't act certainly not act <UNK> and it's entirely possible she can't but lord how she tries she looks older than 17 and acts way younger like a seven year old <UNK> in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award and she is not alone it is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow as if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing br br now this was an early effort for chris <UNK> and he clearly would improve and having better writers e g john hughes himself certainly helped so perhaps some forgiveness is in order but the film just <UNK> of desperation yet like i said it may work for some if any of the above appeals to you and it clearly did some of the reviewers then go get the dvd and knock yourself out otherwise avoid this mess like you would a dark chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear <UNK> <UNK>
<START> mark <UNK> from the old late night tv show <UNK> plays dr daniel <UNK> a mild mannered surgeon who <UNK> a <UNK> that turns him into a drug crazed party animal this was not of course his intent he had higher aspirations but he goes with the flow this is actually a fairly stupid movie but it's also pretty fun of course once the good doctor realizes what he's done he's ashamed but he's also not above doing it all again running through hollywood as a crazed sex machine with out hair gold chains there's a few subplots like fiancée who is the daughter of the head doctor at our lady of suffering and pain <UNK> and there's tim <UNK> as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few real parts and a taste for men and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of howard hughes and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of <UNK> <UNK> including <UNK> yeah the humor is raunchy and silly and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless but if you're not above a quick <UNK> in the <UNK> you'll probably like it just fine now available on dvd too for the first time <UNK> 7 out of 10
<START> this was truly the most painful experience i have had in quite some time in a movie theater i will <UNK> such <UNK> criticisms as or or <UNK> <UNK> because quite simply our <UNK> would then immediately go out to these words if a director's to make a sweeping <UNK> love epic well for god's sake make a real damn sweeping <UNK> love epic why bother with such laughably unconvincing second rate <UNK> romances and such boring <UNK> between characters we could care less about when the most <UNK> battle on canadian <UNK> is taking place and for the pompous people thinking <UNK> well this story must center characters well you're wrong dead wrong
<START> <UNK> a big struggle as a story that is surreal this movie could've been great as great as it is rated by some here but mixed with the acting director and relatives playing major roles due to financial reasons i <UNK> found in here although calling this acting is not only a stretch of that word it's giving it a new meaning a whole new meaning br br if you are into surreal movies there are some that i do like actually see the japanese strange circus for example you might be able to overlook the flaws see above and enjoy this more there are great ideas here after all many great <UNK> and ambiguous scenes but while watching this with a group of friends almost all of us just couldn't stop laughing not the intention of the director of course again everyone has their own liking as one can see by the high rating of this movie but i could only recommend the movie if you're aware of the work that <UNK> <UNK> has done and or are a fan of his
<START> i have had this movie in the back of my head sense i saw it i have wanted to tell people about it time and again but never remembered now i found it now finally i can tell people precisely what the absolute worst most crappy movie i have ever seen in my entire life bar none is br br this movie is complete trash and is <UNK> for a garbage dump all <UNK> and other <UNK> of this movie should be rounded up loaded into a large rocket and launched into the sun only the <UNK> heat and pressure of the sun might be able to <UNK> the <UNK> this movie is <UNK> on so that they can be useful to the universe again br br i like movies i like bad movies and yes this is an opinion but this movie was pure trash filth and <UNK> of some beast that should never be seen let alone named by man br br i would rather watch a uwe boll movie marathon than watch this movie and i hate uwe <UNK> films
<START> let's see how many ways you can insult my gender 1 of course girl 1 is a horrible <UNK> who <UNK> on her boyfriend and sounds looks like a heroin addict br br 2 of course girl 1 sleeps with the guy on the first date after getting wasted br br 3 of course the lesbians are butch germans who are into s m br br 4 this one was actually a surprise ending the movie on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of characters was sickening seeing a woman beaten isn't my idea of comedy br br 5 director's commentary talking about <UNK> up with actresses in the movie just so you know is crass and incredibly <UNK>
<START> don't bother to check for logic there is none but on the other hand there are many really great movies that totally lack logic so why bother br br i both like and dislike this film i like it because the action sequences in the air are really great you get to see a lot of i also like the f 16 which is a very cool plane br br but there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it i guess it's not fair to wish for some sort of continuity as it is hard to make a really good fighter film but i also think there should be some sense of reason br br and i have a question do they fly from california to the middle east in f <UNK> without air <UNK> i'd like to see that happening
<START> there are a few scripts like this one floating around hollywood this one is not even close to the best just the first this is all production value no substance but the disney name probably will help it a good idea a wasted opportunity
<START> this <UNK> of derivative drivel stole from every soviet film of note and failed miserably i was left with an experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and the russian <UNK> <UNK> particular shortcomings mind you this comment comes from a person of faith even the outstanding cinematography left me uninspired i spent its most beautiful moments very aware of the <UNK> that it was poorly imitating i would not recommend seeing this movie unless you have a deep passion for the russian <UNK> church its traditions <UNK> in the face of communism and saints of the seventies it is a meaningless film from and about a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing for me
<START> i'm not sure i've ever seen a film as bad as this awful acting all over the place plot terrible special effects there are some <UNK> bad its <UNK> moments in here but not really enough to maintain interest the woman who plays <UNK> looks hideous there are some fairly worrying scenes with a dwarf which leave you feeling ever so slightly <UNK> on the plus side the operation scenes are fairly amusing for the special effects as is the car chase where one car is trying to force us off the road without actually making contact guess the budget didn't stretch to <UNK> cars oh and what looks like a <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> is shown every time they cut to the fictional foreign country
<START> this movie is so stupid that i want my 2 99 back that i paid for first this movie starts off with a bunch of wooden actor <UNK> with fill in talent like they got picked off the street somewhere because the real actors either did not show up because of the laughable script or they just couldn't get anybody desperate enough to do this movie the music in this movie is enough to put you to sleep <UNK> music made for dancing in the wilderness wouldn't even be good enough for this movie and the guy dressed up as satan looks like he's all dressed up in a k mart halloween special costume there are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes when i saw what the terrible killers looked like in those bath <UNK> with <UNK> faces i just laughed this is what the whole town is supposed to be running away from once a year this movie is one of the worst demonic movies i have ever seen avoid this one
<START> i absolutely <UNK> this movie for me the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like boston legal or ally <UNK> or even la law this is reality the law is not <UNK> won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt like the <UNK> defense on south park this is a real travesty of justice the legal system gone horribly wrong and the work by good lawyers not the <UNK> stereotype who use all of their skills to right it it will do more for <UNK> your faith in humanity than any frank <UNK> movie or to kill a <UNK> and most importantly i <UNK> during the film during the <UNK> included at the end of the dvd it's amazing wonderful film wonderfully made thank god the filmmakers made it
<START> king of queens is comic genius kevin james whom plays <UNK> doug is extremely funny <UNK> who plays wife carrie is incredibly hot 19 on stuff <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> woman list and very funny the true magic of the show however is the scenes with jerry stiller they are the funniest in the show jerry a comic genius plays <UNK> father arthur <UNK> whom lives in doug and <UNK> always cold basement i must admit that i never watched this show until this year 2006 whenever i had <UNK> by it previously it never seemed funny but with the <UNK> of friends still standing and yes dear i needed some new comedy actually giving the king of queens a chance i discovered that it was absolutely fantastic so funny in fact that i <UNK> the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8 hour <UNK> i strongly urge anyone whom has not seen this treasure to check it out you will not be disappointed
<START> there are many film now on dvd but producers had forgotten some of importance to many <UNK> the egyptian along with el <UNK> and other favorites of the era of the wide screen big budget epics had merit many people from my generation learn a lot about history of egypt medieval spain and even the <UNK> the first time i heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with charlton heston called the treasure of the <UNK> same happened to me with egypt or rome seen many bad epics of the era many production values excellent use of color the de color was more and sharp that the ordinary technicolor maybe the cast was wrong but in any case the film did to give us idea of the life in ancient <UNK> and was in a way the <UNK> to go out and buy the novel my one of the best if not the best historical novel ever published also <UNK> <UNK> was the superb score by alfred newman and bernard <UNK> i saw this film many times when i was a boy it was not the big box office hit that fox studios wanted to the <UNK> enormous hit in <UNK> and <UNK> was a wonderful eye popping i have the <UNK> disc version m the only way to see <UNK> its format soon i hope will appeared
<START> to solve a challenging problem you need to start by asking the right questions without these even the biggest library of information is useless this movie does just that where other movies guide your thinking along a story board this film pulls at your emotions and your understanding of justice and what's <UNK> these questions will <UNK> at you throughout challenging your <UNK> as the characters develop this movie is important it's relevant and a must see for anybody who stays informed of current affairs the fact it's highly entertaining and includes a slew of movie stars only <UNK> the execution my advice watch it with a serious crowd or better yet by yourself not unlike how you'd read an <UNK> from your favorite news magazine in this case there is one difference the answers will be your own
<START> the trio are a pleasant nostalgic journey to that first hint of desire when it was still about simple exploration of the unknown before we grew up and added those <UNK> of hiv status emotional <UNK> and gotta run my just went off into the emotional mix br br the angst portrayed is pure adolescent angst but it rings true in all three stories their <UNK> and <UNK> make you feel good that you are gay and those kinds of films are few and far between br br good news both boys life and boys life 2 are now readily available on dvd as of september 1999
<START> here he is a new horror icon for the new millennium better than freddy more dangerous than jason <UNK> more evil than michael myers hard to believe i know but his time is here br br ray the <UNK> br br yep the antagonist ray is a complete <UNK> this is partly because of the naughty things he does also because he has a <UNK> oh scary on his face but mainly because ray the <UNK> has been <UNK> br br yep ray doesn't channel evil he doesn't even become cursed not even by a voodoo spell nope ray the <UNK> has been <UNK> as deniro once said you can milk anything with <UNK> and ray has been <UNK> of evil br br how do you milk evil you ask snake <UNK> i <UNK> snake <UNK> br br why ray you ask because he's a <UNK> i <UNK> capital p br br watch out for the new line pictures <UNK> entitled freddy vs ray the <UNK> br br thought your new horror <UNK> was the <UNK> well not any more cause ray the <UNK> is here and i'm frightened br br pity about the atmosphere less pg 13 unoriginal <UNK> quality of the film though because <UNK> a star
<START> a genuinely odd surreal <UNK> of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the <UNK> page just what drew robert redford to the project one may never know sidney j <UNK> directs this <UNK> journey of an <UNK> motorcycle <UNK> taking a <UNK> juvenile under his wing the kid looks up to this anti hero and eventually begins to ape his <UNK> disjointed and off putting though for some the sight of redford <UNK> about to <UNK> or having been <UNK> might be enough to warrant attention lauren <UNK> gets naked too however all the sexy flashes are just <UNK> for the <UNK> minded there simply is no story perhaps <UNK> was making an <UNK> comment about <UNK> <UNK> and their flock circa 1970 if true then this pre blank generation approach <UNK> as the film was not a success 1 2 from
<START> this movie is a nice cute family oriented film if you don't like violence this is the movie to watch only thing annoying about this movie is the tune but it's a catchy tune repeats whenever c h o m p s leaps in to action
<START> it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job br br <UNK> an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south the crowd could really care less about the details they are just hell bent on a hanging and despite his commitment to the law the one lawyer in town who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and doesn't really want to know the truth just <UNK> the hanging until they could try and convict him and then have a legal hanging fortunately a young white man claude begins to wonder about innocence and begins seeking out the truth at this point the best character in this wonderful drama is introduced played by elizabeth <UNK> the old lady who later played mrs on i love lucy she single <UNK> steals the show as the white person with not only a conscience but the will and determination to stand up for the black man at one wonderful point in the film a mob is trying to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him but she stands very firm and forces them to back down there is a lot more to this rather complicated but intelligently written story but i'll leave it to you to see it for yourself see it with your kids if you have a chance it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years br br by the way apparently 1949 was a great year for hollywood finally addressing race prejudice head on as <UNK> century fox also released <UNK> an equally effective and strong film about racism <UNK> marriage and even rape see both films if you can
<START> on the face of it any teen comedy runs the risk of being <UNK> and obvious and fair enough most of them are there are a few that have <UNK> above the usual <UNK> of the source material bring it on and they give me hope that others can join that <UNK> rare crowd of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just an excuse to flash some boobs or be a vehicle for some never was like tom green br br enter accepted directed by john cusack pal steve pink and led by the likable justin long the smart nerdy kid in galaxy quest and more recently featured in apple computer ads about a bunch of kids who don't get accepted to college and decide as <UNK> in the trailer to fake a bogus one to get their parents off their backs when they go a little too far with the website and other kids end up the kids have a few problems to solve br br okay the set up is obviously preposterous but most comedy lives or dies in the execution and here accepted does pretty well <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mostly <UNK> to <UNK> is accompanied by enough well meaning <UNK> acceptable friends to help him share the load but probably the best supporting character is lewis no doubt named as an homage to rodney <UNK> dean martin aka uncle ben lewis black who is wisely <UNK> to short <UNK> where he can rapid fire his unique brand of <UNK> <UNK> humor black is terrific here frankly telling the kids what life is really like his <UNK> laden final line is hysterical and providing the adult face to the bogus university for the parents br br but long has to carry most of the film and he does so in <UNK> <UNK> is easily identified with and we take to him almost immediately a nice twist was provided by <UNK> <UNK> character hands an <UNK> who loses his <UNK> due to an injury and ends up becoming the de <UNK> art <UNK> at the fake college also noteworthy as hyper intelligent and sarcastic little sister is hannah marks br br yes the film does feel familiar in some spots there's a debt here <UNK> of all places to revenge of the <UNK> those who are rejected by everyone else find a home with <UNK> and his <UNK> and of course the villains are <UNK> enhanced <UNK> master race types who run a <UNK> well okay <UNK> are evil and seek to <UNK> and bury the <UNK> for the  gasp  crime of being different but that aside accepted has fun with the material and even asks a few decent questions about the expectations on college kids and the course of higher education not that it's a brain <UNK> by any means but accepted isn't just another mindless teen comedy or owen wilson vehicle it's a funny clever 90 minutes that while not a great departure from its genre is intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyable br br there is at least one moment of <UNK> brilliance in the film when <UNK> <UNK> out a nearby college in an attempt to <UNK> ideas for his own <UNK> <UNK> when he sees that the kids are all <UNK> out at the other school several refuse to even talk to him during class for fear of missing something he shakes his head thinking that there must be a better way as he moves to leave he is met by a stream of kids going the other way one person moving against a human tide while in the background the opening lines of <UNK> <UNK> play perhaps an <UNK> moment of brilliance but brilliance none the less
<START> well i have been to a british university in fact i went to the one in this very film and it was nothing like that this is a horrible badly made and acted film worst thing is it could have been really good if they bothered to spend more that on it in fact if it really wanted to represent true british students it should off acted like one and took out a 15 thousand pound <UNK> it says nothing about <UNK> life where was the bush diving the tea drinking till <UNK> the endless <UNK> about group dynamics where was the diversity and fun maybe i'm just being romantic but i don't remember week being that awful and i'm and in the end the question still remains a bed or a wardrobe
<START> unlike most reviewers here i hated this movie simply because the writer director's <UNK> ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic too many film fans <UNK> self to <UNK> genius ' but i don't buy into that cult of personality a film should be about its subject not its director unless it's a woody allen film of course spoiler which is just as well save your time there is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot long porn <UNK> you know what in the last frame that's actually called a tacky <UNK> that screams film school br br the flick has achieved <UNK> <UNK> status based on its <UNK> and <UNK> to the audience  which first and foremost is the writer director but the rest of the audience should look down on the <UNK> brutal nature of the porn <UNK> too the flick had an <UNK> angle to the porn industry looking down on each and every player it could bash no matter just love your writer director love those four minute <UNK> segments which are supposed to show the energy of the moment but somehow had all the <UNK> of an off switch love the story no matter how dull it is about the gee <UNK> rise and <UNK> fall of a porn star but look down on it too of course while the subject has the potential to be fascinating  innocence money <UNK> beauty your <UNK> writer director somehow managed to make it all look again dull partly because of its run time here is something your auteur hero didn't try giving the characters dimension or soul anything at all to give a hoot about aside from genius that paul is of course but i'm not buying i don't buy into indulgent <UNK> with astounding hype br br another overlong <UNK> hack piece with fifty times more hype than quality i know some of you agree the rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again not my problem
<START> as a rule there are few things more <UNK> than hollywood's attempts to be courageous mixing caution with heavy <UNK> message movies pat themselves <UNK> on the back for daring to tackle major problems <UNK> is not entirely free from this <UNK> it includes a <UNK> on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious assuming a level of <UNK> in its audience that's depressing to contemplate as late as <UNK> it was a big deal for a movie to <UNK> that anti <UNK> existed and that it was bad it was <UNK> of course for hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was victim was a homosexual nevertheless thanks to good writing and excellent acting <UNK> remains a <UNK> examination of what we would now call a hate crime br br <UNK> <UNK> was one of the major <UNK> of film noir and <UNK> <UNK> it directly the film is set in washington d c among soldiers still in uniform but <UNK> spending their days playing poker and bar <UNK> joseph sam <UNK> an intelligent and kindly jew explains that the end of the war has created a void all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now <UNK> and <UNK> up meets three soldiers in a bar the sensitive mitchell who is close to a nervous breakdown the weak <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a tall overbearing bully who <UNK> a young soldier from <UNK> as a stupid <UNK> the three soldiers wind up at apartment where the drunken monty becomes increasingly abusive calling his host jew boy is beaten to death and mitchell disappears making himself the prime suspect for the killing br br <UNK> the crime are detective <UNK> robert young dry and by the book and sergeant robert mitchum a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows mitchell is incapable of murder among the pieces of the puzzle are <UNK> gloria <UNK> a nightclub <UNK> who met mitchell and gave him her apartment key and <UNK> steve <UNK> who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy <UNK> house while there is no real <UNK> suspense the story remains gripping and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever br br the strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling <UNK> or <UNK> the cinematography is a striking shadow play with and harsh lights rooms often lit by a single <UNK> <UNK> by cigarette smoke world <UNK> is as <UNK> as noir lighting nothing interests me <UNK> says quietly to nothing is <UNK> in the nightclub gloria <UNK> the <UNK> of noir <UNK> nearly steals the movie with her two scenes <UNK> blonde jaded and <UNK> she's the quintessential b girl <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> mill where she works for laughs she says <UNK> her sweet face <UNK> when mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife now and then a <UNK> kindness <UNK> through her <UNK> shell as when she dances with mitchell in a deserted <UNK> then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment when he goes there he meets a <UNK> <UNK> faced man paul kelly who seems to <UNK> off <UNK> and whose conversation is a dense <UNK> of lies and false <UNK> gloria blows <UNK> good girl wife off the screen in a scene where she's asked to give mitchell an <UNK> slim and <UNK> in her with her <UNK> <UNK> she lets us see just how often <UNK> has been insulted and <UNK> as a tramp br br robert young is a <UNK> actor and he stands no chance against <UNK> charisma but he does a good job of keeping his <UNK> smoking character <UNK> with delivering the movie's earnest message this side of mitchum meanwhile gets some cool dialogue but not nearly enough to do still even when he's doing nothing but <UNK> in a corner you can't take your eyes off him the third robert ryan creates a fully <UNK> and <UNK> convincing portrait of an ignorant unstable <UNK> we see his phony <UNK> his bullying his <UNK> of anyone with <UNK> his am i right or am i right <UNK> how easily he <UNK> <UNK> on people and what satisfaction he gets from <UNK> them br br message seems <UNK> and dated now though not nearly so much as the same year's a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> speech about <UNK> cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white reminding us that irish <UNK> were once <UNK> next it could be people from <UNK> he says or men who wear <UNK> <UNK> or maybe blacks or japanese or <UNK> or <UNK> the script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems it its message by making the jewish victim <UNK> as though his innocence were not sufficient and it takes care to <UNK> the military having a superior officer <UNK> that the army is ashamed of men like <UNK> and <UNK> that served <UNK> in the war still it did take some guts to depict immediately after world war ii an american who might have been happier in the nazi army and the movie's basic premise is still valid if monty were alive today he would have gone out on september 12 2001 and beat up a <UNK>
<START> i gave soul plane the benefit of the doubt and thought there would actually be something of comedic value in it im not black but that does not mean i cant appreciate black comedy i know that because i happen to enjoy watching the wayans bros good times and other series br br i've seen crap movies and im not easily <UNK> as for soul plane i didn't even bother finishing it don't know if they managed to land the plane and i couldn't care less it would be unfair to say i didn't find some parts funny as i did laugh but i also laugh at youtube videos of falling on their nuts so that doesn't say much the men in the movie were like a bunch of howling horny <UNK> in <UNK> season looking to get some whenever and where ever possible and we wonder why all those stereotypes don't seem to disappear to <UNK> soul plane makes the harold and kumar series look like the godfather
<START> when i first saw this on tape about 10 years after it had been released i thought it was one of the better james bond movies however after seeing it again around the turn of the century i was disappointed br br i think it's a bit overrated only because critics were so happy to see sean connery end his 12 year <UNK> from playing bond that they didn't dare criticize the film i guess what disappointed me was the ending after <UNK> two hours into the film you expect a less hokey more satisfying ending and it may be <UNK> but i was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as miss <UNK> q felix etc br br on the positive side there was plenty of unique action scenes particularly early on and the two villains were interesting i thought <UNK> maria <UNK> was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low key and looked the nice guy next door he wasn't your normal bond villain br br this had plenty of skin for a pg movie especially with kim basinger starring never being an actress known for hiding her figure the language was very tame but most bond movies are pretty good in that department br br all in all it's a fair bond and nothing else just because connery is in it it doesn't mean it's automatically good roger moore and pierce brosnan have proved they could play the role well too
<START> br br the last is a superior western that <UNK> numerous <UNK> in <UNK> its tale of jed victor mature gus james <UNK> and pat hogan and their relationships with the army particularly captain guy madison colonel robert preston and <UNK> <UNK> wife anne <UNK> hired as <UNK> after losing their supplies to the indians jed gus and <UNK> <UNK> to living the life within a <UNK> on the edge of the last frontier ' jed who has been raised by gus both <UNK> and looks up to the gus and <UNK> and has an especially difficult time dealing with civilization ' his real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the <UNK> wife <UNK> colonel a reckless man who every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any <UNK> <UNK> a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility loves her husband for what he could be and jed for what he is caught in the middle is captain a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army his strong friendship with jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the <UNK> <UNK> br br what makes this movie so interesting as well as entertaining is that in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of the last are exactly the same elements forget the insipid title and dated music br br first the screenplay almost all of the subplots particularly the reckless colonel have been done better elsewhere but have rarely been assembled with such <UNK> just when you think you know what is going to happen next this one takes off in a different direction possible spoiler the last being a production <UNK> movie back in the day the word <UNK> was taboo it's very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature <UNK> manner i expected either jed or the <UNK> wife to <UNK> some <UNK> for their sin i was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn't exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending br br second the casting mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of jed the wild eyed innocent raised in the <UNK> james <UNK> who plays gus the man who raised is actually five years younger than mature nevertheless mature is very endearing playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time most notably burt <UNK> and kirk douglas none could have played jed better preston also <UNK> junior plays colonel missing the <UNK> and <UNK> one would expect from such a driven man however preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in to promote such a reckless fool to <UNK> rank <UNK> is an especially <UNK> choice as <UNK> <UNK> dark hair has been died blonde and this achieves the same effect as it did for <UNK> <UNK> edward <UNK> and christina <UNK> sleepy <UNK> that is i felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why i believe the answer is that <UNK> and <UNK> have considerably different skin tones and eye shades further <UNK> has always projected a <UNK> that borders on <UNK> here the blonde hair <UNK> her up a bit though this <UNK> the 24 year old <UNK> to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old mature and the <UNK> year old preston yep she could be a <UNK> wife madison walks a careful <UNK> act as <UNK> handling a complex role and sometimes dialogue playing a role similar to that of john wayne in <UNK> madison does a more <UNK> job at it br br this movie has a type <UNK> that alone makes it worth seeing it also has memorable performances beautiful and great action and direction i just hope a <UNK> version is available many have been lost because this movie takes full advantage of that format
<START> man alive is this game bad or what the graphics are way below par even if it were on a <UNK> 1 never mind a <UNK> the <UNK> is pathetic and the camera movements what a worthless game br br i totally love <UNK> batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games in this way batman vengeance could well have turned out great as they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors but they seriously stumbled when it came to and graphics the result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is no fun to play whatsoever i really must stress how bad the graphics are don't let the color schemes fool you i've seen better stuff on a <UNK> 64
<START> okay if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema it wouldn't be particularly worthwhile however in <UNK> films were in their <UNK> and they were almost all rather dull and had no real story to tell instead just showing normal everyday folks doing everyday activities if seen today almost all of them are hopelessly dull and very very short often less than one minute long and so in light of this this short clip of a movie is pretty <UNK> stuff and might just make you laugh two guys a miller and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into each other falling and throwing <UNK> and coal dust all over each other as they <UNK> that's all the film is over before you know it
<START> this movie is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins falls in love with one of her cousin and reject the advance of a amoral <UNK> who brings trouble on the family after seeing the 1999 version and reading the book i decided to watch the older version i found it did stay true to <UNK> character in the book but it was also boring character <UNK> character played by le was lackluster she often appeared to be about to faint i also did not like robert who played henry crawford i could not imagine him being interested in <UNK> or her cousin maria jackie smith wood who played mary crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly i lost interested in her acting and i kept staring at her wig i kept expecting it would drop off her head i could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig
<START> possible spoilers below br br what a long and mostly uninteresting movie who were these characters why didn't i care about them if i'm going to watch a movie for two hours i'd like to care about somebody or something br br we know that <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> to be found in the new world beyond that though we learned little about most of his family's hopes fears etc as they <UNK> on an adventure into the unknown br br and why was lucy even in this movie she said little we knew little about her or what she was doing was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship or what her plans were upon reaching new york to those who might suggest that she was needed to <UNK> the point that a single woman however <UNK> could not get into this country alone i say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time that point could have been made in five minutes with lucy as a <UNK> character br br more questions why wasn't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family we heard about the brother and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some <UNK> also how long was the journey from italy to new york given the conditions on the ship it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days someone said something about seeing land a week at one point but i think that was when they were already en route i needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through br br the only scene i really liked was when the boat filled with passengers left the <UNK> br br if you choose to rent this movie do so with remote in hand you may want the fast forward button handy br br finally may i suggest that with the right voice over providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrants particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside people walking etc this movie might have made an interesting public tv documentary
<START> the plot for a movie such of this is a <UNK> how can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of india a story like this writes itself i'll watch most anything but this was unwatchable the sad thing is the white folks are the most colorful in the film vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor and jack was great eye candy but everyone else was so boring jeffrey who was exceptional in my beautiful did what he could but the story was so boring the saving grace was really the background music which made it ok to laugh at the film instead of with the film or not at all there are many other better gay movies ethnic movies just plain movies i give a lot of low budget movies a pass but this shouldn't have been made or should have been made by someone else
<START> du <UNK> <UNK> les <UNK> 1955 can on the surface be described as a french variation on john <UNK> <UNK> heist film <UNK> jungle 1950 the difference between the two films is <UNK> 1955 pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence also the police aren't involved in the aftermath of the robbery in <UNK> as much as in <UNK> jungle in the end <UNK> 1955 is in my opinion a slightly better film than <UNK> jungle 1950 remarkable noir picture that <UNK> 1950s french cinema br br <UNK> 1960 may have been the one which broke down the infamous <UNK> but in my opinion <UNK> 1955 was the film that began to break apart the <UNK> hollywood <UNK> first film in five years for jules <UNK> who was <UNK> by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late 40s to early 50s he got some sort of <UNK> when <UNK> 1955 became a success around france and europe thus <UNK> the hollywood <UNK> in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same <UNK> 1955 is the most important film of <UNK> career because it not only restored his name but also gave him a second chance at making films br br jules <UNK> gave the and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions his handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless builds up tense situations with precise <UNK> <UNK> came full circle in the film noir genre by directing his best and last noir <UNK> 1955 marked the end of <UNK> period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing noir pictures br br <UNK> 1955 is the number one film in an <UNK> of thirty plus films for director jules <UNK> a masterpiece in acting cinematography directing editing and writing not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on as brilliant as anything by jean pierre <UNK> who was a master of this type of film masterpieces such as <UNK> 1955 are relatively small compared to the probably <UNK> of films made in motion picture history br br the one fascinating aspect of <UNK> is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the minute duration the main characters plan and <UNK> the jewel heist in the same way a film director <UNK> for the pre productions production and post production of a film shows how difficult a jewel heist like in <UNK> 1955 is in committing and why very few would do something like it the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picture br br lack of unnatural sound in the landmark minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism any dialogue or and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream patience <UNK> a level of <UNK> that never once lets down br br maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence <UNK> to perfection the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence that's rarely <UNK> in most robbery scenes from heist films jean and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing the robbery sequence of <UNK> 1955 reaches a <UNK> level of suspense and tension br br many filmmakers from the years following du <UNK> <UNK> les 1955 have been influenced if not inspired by it one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre <UNK> original choice for director of <UNK> who used variations of the heist sequence in le <UNK> and le <UNK> 1970 another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing 1956 also quentin tarantino whose debut feature <UNK> dogs 1992 was inspired by this film other film directors influenced are john woo michael mann paul <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc br br du <UNK> <UNK> les 1955 is comparable to bob le 1955 in many ways one jules <UNK> and jean pierre <UNK> directed groundbreaking films in <UNK> 1955 and bob le 1955 two each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist three bob le and <UNK> finishes in <UNK> fashion four each film shares many <UNK> and situations that <UNK> the two as film <UNK> br br part of charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le jo le mario and <UNK> le most of the violence is <UNK> yet effectively brutal the main characters led by tony le <UNK> by a strong outdated code of honor that is of sam <UNK> and john woo jean becomes the role of tony le with his cynical <UNK> and tired looks du <UNK> <UNK> les <UNK> 1955 became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end
<START> somewhere in usa the young <UNK> <UNK> her friends <UNK> billy and john showing a letter that would be sent by bob to her and the group cowardly beats bob and <UNK> kills him with a piece of wood in the forest <UNK> feels sorrow and decides to tell his mother what he did but john and billy <UNK> him with tragic consequences br br i believe the wind is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the awful screenplay is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary since there is no story or plot only sequences of <UNK> scenes the amateurish direction and acting are amazingly poor and terrible it is unbelievable how producers <UNK> money in such garbage <UNK> release this crap worldwide and viewers like me buy this dvd i waited until the very last scene because i was curious to see how bad this film could be and i was impressed since it is worse than i could imagine in my lowest expectations in the end i question why imdb does not offer zero in the vote system since the garbage really deserves this vote my vote is one br br title brazil invisible force
<START> do you liked dead man don't wear <UNK> what about top secret and a chorus line well is a fantastic <UNK> of all three of them as unlikely it may seem very funny tongue in cheek movie noir <UNK> with stunning songs and great dancing you have to have a little odd humor for this movie but it is very well worth seeing it i've voted it a nine if the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten thats how good that movie is
<START> it's along the line of comedy of errors mistaken affection <UNK> from one to another <UNK> and passes cat and mouse <UNK> of passion sparks of fire <UNK> and put maybe she loves he loves or they circle of emotions <UNK> yet not to let him know wanting to let her know let them <UNK> good ensemble cast in spite of the seemingly confusing mix of emotions from different parties involved br br it's a refreshing <UNK> casual free and easy and rather down to earth not hollywood glamorous like <UNK> hill but lots of human feelings <UNK> vulnerability a flowing yes all revolving around an accidentally lost found love letter kate <UNK> as the owner of the town's <UNK> with a variety of characters portrayed by ellen <UNK> tom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tom everett scott gloria stuart alice <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the seemingly <UNK> mrs romance is in the air love lurking everywhere you get to appreciate the talented kate <UNK> the <UNK> is another quirky little movie which is fun to watch <UNK> has a wonderful chemistry with david arquette and arquette with stanley <UNK> br br <UNK> hill is satisfying in its story revolving around the <UNK> pairing of julia roberts and hugh grant and the wonderful support of his circle of london friends love letters is delightful in its quirky small town <UNK> and its story involving kate <UNK> <UNK> effects on her friends and neighbors both maybe fantasies somehow the latter felt more <UNK> if it should happen to you and if you appreciate words or poetic lines it could be the movie for you
<START> universal studios the name <UNK> up so many memories to horror fans of beautiful <UNK> paintings er landscapes fog <UNK> full <UNK> howling wolves <UNK> and torch wielding <UNK> yet it is quite strange looking back on those films how little the era which produced the true classics lasted the <UNK> had it's masterpieces but those were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today the <UNK> produced more <UNK> fun <UNK> films than it did high art and most fans agree that the classic era of the gothic horror films ended in 1945 with <UNK> of <UNK> around with the <UNK> <UNK> comedies and was officially dead by the 50's and the coming of the atomic age br br so it's strange that perhaps one of <UNK> finest was made in the <UNK> that alone makes the film an <UNK> since costume dramas were on their way out everywhere it may not be comparable to the all time classics like the james whale films and 'the but damn does it <UNK> all the fun elements of those films into one delicious treat get ready for nothing but pure entertainment since various social <UNK> had changed the film also <UNK> in violence that would not have been allowed in earlier <UNK> there's no blood but we see characters shot and stabbed directly and there's even a burning torch to the face br br the film may not really be a horror film but it sure has the atmosphere look and feel of one it begins in the dead of night with howling winds and wolves as two men seal the <UNK> of two apparently dead young lovers but wait one of them is not dead but he can't move he's trapped but talking <UNK> in his own mind unable to communicate what is his story now that is how you start a horror film br br english businessman sir ronald burton richard greene giving one of his best performances sets out under the <UNK> of richard <UNK> to investigate the disappearance of two friends of his who disappeared at the castle of one eyed <UNK> count von bruno did <UNK> baron cohen see this it seems many years ago von bruno <UNK> as a god to the natives in africa to steal <UNK> he was exposed by <UNK> men and the natives <UNK> him now he is <UNK> for revenge br br the film has all the clichés a jonathan <UNK> style ride to the castle an <UNK> full of <UNK> villagers death traps and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr the torture chamber scenes are genuinely suspenseful including a <UNK> in the floor that <UNK> a <UNK> door which makes for an ingenious <UNK> scene later on a hunting expedition involving an <UNK> <UNK> and even an alligator pit and then there's the romeo juliet style fake death that leads to the film's prologue br br the plot is cliché and the world view is black and white but it's still incredibly entertaining with director nathan making every scene pile on the atmosphere and seem fresh and new there are several plot holes too why does ronald attempt to leave the castle so early and he never does solve the mystery of what happened to his friends even though it's obvious but he doesn't know that when he gives up and he seemed so sure earlier weird br br all of the actors are great despite being a rude richard greene makes burton one of the most likable protagonists i've ever seen in a horror film rita is excellent as the <UNK> <UNK> who becomes <UNK> love interest she may have the stereotypical in love with just a problem of all film <UNK> of this era but her portrayal of a long suffering woman in a <UNK> marriage to a sadistic monster is very convincing she also shows a suspicion and wit few film <UNK> of this era do even seeing a forced attempt by burton to quiet her and to <UNK> at her <UNK> although it is simply to analyze it as it has an important clue as a rape attempt yet she never seems nasty in her paranoia the audience <UNK> with her even though he fails to make von bruno seem truly foreign and <UNK> he is a villain in a horror film after all stephen <UNK> gives a truly chilling performance as the sadistic <UNK> when he reveals his burnt eye and laughs <UNK> it is truly scary <UNK> <UNK> jr is also great as his mute henchman br br but the best performance is undeniably by boris karloff as the mysterious <UNK> dr he has little screen time at first but steals every scene he is in it is a performance that is both creepy sad mysterious and ultimately heroic as he <UNK> <UNK> as he applies <UNK> to one of <UNK> henchman spies on our hero and speaks in that famous <UNK> know i'm up to no <UNK> voice only karloff could make you wonder whether if he is a hero or villain always <UNK> about and although he does function as the main agent of our hero's escape he still shows human <UNK> such as greed and for his own life even cold <UNK> <UNK> a man for <UNK> benefit before he even gets burton to agree his plan to help our hero heroine escape also puts them directly in the <UNK> of von bruno as he <UNK> an amazingly sadistic if unbelievably flawed death for them that had to have inspired similar scenes in <UNK> poe series he may not have much screen time but this is easily one of best performances br br while the ending may seem abrupt and anti climatic for some half the fun is getting there and there's much excitement to be had kick back and <UNK> the days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains it's no masterpiece but it's <UNK> fun at it's best
<START> may contain spoilers but of course it does not matter br br <UNK> <UNK> is one stunning spectacle of haunting images the visual direction is well and has been inspiring the sheer scale of the film is impressive and the technique is certainly <UNK> what is really amazing is to my mind the depth and <UNK> of a film devoid of proper literary script sound save the soundtrack decent image quality the faux profound self of today exceptional acting <UNK> etc what you get is a purely visual experience to be remembered br br btw the previous poster noted felt after a lot of suffering to give the heroes what they wanted the problem is that you think <UNK> is building up to a big final fight and then he tricks you it's a little cheap i would've rather seen a huge final action scene br br i must warn you that the end is not cheap and <UNK> wasn't being generous to the heroes history however was <UNK> really did go through the <UNK> as it was shown in the film br br finally i'd strongly recommend seeing <UNK> <UNK> to anyone more or less seriously interested in cinema see it with a fellow movie buff it kept me talking for hours however if you tend to consider films generally accepted as great or classic to be slow or boring this film might not be for you yet not much cheap entertainment here br br for me though it is a full 10 10
<START> i read a <UNK> hidden remarks on a previous comments stating that this film showed a bunch of gay guys <UNK> around their <UNK> br br this couldn't be more misleading <UNK> is not a gay film it has only three gay characters in it and one of them is the victim of prejudice of people like the one who wrote the comments despite his confession of fairness br br grandfather was not gay the tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is male bonding at the crucial moment of death but some people gets appalled by a kiss and welcome scene of guts flying out of a man killed by a bomb br br the focus of the film is the straight relationship of <UNK> and that sweet girl and their facing their social <UNK> and <UNK> br br ralph www info

<START> my favorite show of all time yeah i thought this was so cool and was the first crush i ever had it was well written funny except when it it wanted to be serious and just a great show overall but since we couldn't afford to keep nick i couldn't see any episodes after <UNK> 1996 and maybe that makes me think more of the show than i should to me it's more the <UNK> now that doesn't look spelled right of having to say goodbye to someone that you love and know you'll never see them again and i still think that because as far as i know there are no plans to release this on dvd any time soon yeah life is mean i've found that out for sure though you can find an odd episode every here or there but i never liked the <UNK> copies of things much either br br so enough of my sad life most kids in <UNK> grade don't need powers like alex gets to get them through life unrealistic for sure but then again how many towns have a super evil chemical plants that is willing to do anything for progress at any cost gee this show was fun to watch though i'd agree the is a bit over developed and even a little politically correct sometimes my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant a video tape or something like that like a kid's version of tom <UNK> six which years later i got hooked on that game series for probably the same reason almost then you've got the <UNK> security team who are trying desperately to find the kid from the accident very mean <UNK> at least when i first watched the show they seem more sympathetic to me now i feel rather sad for not sure if she minds this role type casting her but it's what i'll always remember her by br br oh and btw the actor that plays aaron from 24 is on here too as a school coach or something too cool maybe he can get the producers of that show to get in next season of 24 i only bring it up jack bauer is my other tv hero and i'd just love to see cross over things lol both are set in california so i'll just keep on i can see it now let me alone with that suspect for a few minutes no i don't need a car <UNK>
<START> six stars for paul <UNK> portrayal of general negative four for the inclusion of a highly <UNK> event where the truth is well documented michael <UNK> did not really exist his character or at least his fate is based loosely on that of louis a canadian <UNK> who did not come to los until after the war he <UNK> his lethal tail of the dragon experiment in may 1946 this is a critical point the effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> had anyone died of radiation <UNK> at los before the <UNK> test it's very possible that the scientists would have abruptly stopped their work and history would have been changed whether for the better or the worse we can only <UNK> someone should ask the producers and the director whether they added character for dramatic effect or to deliver an anti nuclear message for a more even handed and accurate treatment of events at los during the manhattan project see the tv movie day one or better yet read the peter book on which it is based
<START> it's been over 30 years now but i still remember that this movie was the worst i've ever seen i would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but i was mistaken i just finished watching starship troopers and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than poor cow
<START> in the aftermath of september <UNK> in new york this drama about american <UNK> was conceived as a <UNK> and tribute to their <UNK> the story is told with a series of flashbacks where after <UNK> jack <UNK> <UNK> phoenix has crashed through the floor of a burning building and only <UNK> with captain mike kennedy john travolta via the radio the flashbacks basically show how jack grows from being a <UNK> seeing kennedy as a father figure to being a <UNK> legend of course in the present day jack's fellow <UNK> are trying to reach him but they are too late and in the end he lets them leave him and it <UNK> to his funeral where he is praised as one of the best <UNK> they have known also starring <UNK> as linda <UNK> terminator <UNK> robert patrick as <UNK> <UNK> morris <UNK> as tommy drake billy burke as dennis <UNK> <UNK> as ray and tim as tony <UNK> the <UNK> of the film are ultimately all i could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them the rest is a bit too <UNK> for my liking adequate
<START> fires on the plain directed by <UNK> <UNK> and written by <UNK> and <UNK> is a world war two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the <UNK> powers but the japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the <UNK> the main characters name is <UNK> played by and he is a soldier leaving his <UNK> because of him being sick all he has on him is a hand <UNK> his gun and some <UNK> like this he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease but since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed he begins a long walk throughout the whole movie <UNK> remains a bit but very civil when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival <UNK> is still remaining human and would not <UNK> a scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is when <UNK> comes into a village which is completely deserted there he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of japanese soldiers <UNK> up in front of a church this makes <UNK> think and even more scared than he already is that shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly after he turns away from the corpses two a couple or brother and sister very close relationship return to the village in order to get their <UNK> of salt back the main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first although he walked up to them with his gun but shoots the woman once she starts screaming her brother boyfriend husband then runs away in fear and after a moment <UNK> follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing <UNK> he does not hit him after <UNK> picks up the bag of salt something very precious he drops his gun into a river this gesture is very important in order to understand <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and the war comparing this movie to other world war 2 movies it is not typical at all of course all movies have suffering heroes but their heroes are more heroic than <UNK> he expresses everything that is human he is getting manipulated he is weak he gets scared he has hope this is typical for japanese world war two movies and for japanese society since world war two is not a discussed theme in japanese society japanese are likely to put japanese in the second world war in the role of the victim this is also very visual in this movie one of the examples is <UNK> another one the <UNK> up bodies of japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is when the japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike in my personal conclusion i have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual it also has no <UNK> propaganda which could've been easily built in once you have watched the movie fully you will be able to see the horrors of the second world war to its total extent
<START> not the funniest movie ever but i have to watch this film at least once a year just so i can fall in love with michelle johnson all over again she never looked better than she did in this film by the way the story is good too
<START> at the time that this movie was made most <UNK> knew exactly who barbara <UNK> was <UNK> today only some women over 50 probably remember <UNK> whose <UNK> wisdom ran in family circle magazine from before world war ii until the 1970's she lived on farm in and her <UNK> were <UNK> into a number of books seasons etc the lines that barbara <UNK> <UNK> as she types them for her <UNK> are quite typical of the ones that began a typical <UNK> <UNK> besides cooking and country living she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times she talked a lot about her favorite dogs mostly <UNK> you might say that martha stewart is the <UNK> of today br br christmas is <UNK> may not be any cinematic masterpiece but it is pleasant lighthearted entertainment <UNK> to the <UNK> out mind and that is good enough
<START> i can't help thinking that this is <UNK> to the marquis de <UNK> one thousand days of people in this case women <UNK> to serve as slaves to a <UNK> elite check kinky sex check torture including <UNK> check victims chosen at random to be killed check br br thank goodness franco didn't go the whole <UNK> and introduce cinema audiences to the <UNK> of and indeed another <UNK> that <UNK> up repeatedly in de <UNK> <UNK> long and disgusting saga br br i rather hoped that this film would fall into the <UNK> bad it's <UNK> category but even the <UNK> of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters didn't make up for the dismal dialogue dreadful acting <UNK> plot and just to put the tin hat on it dubbing and english sub titles a belt and <UNK> approach missing from the women's costumes the gave a very professional performance though br br of course i could be wrong about the de <UNK> angle after all i failed to realise that the actor playing the head warden at the was a <UNK> sexual i must pay more attention to the size of people's hands in future br br according to another reviewer the film was banned in the uk well it clearly isn't any more though i fancy that the <UNK> scene was cut to satisfy the censors on the dvd i watched it was only clearly visible on the spanish trailer which in case you're wondering i watched to compare it with the english one br br the dvd also features an interview with jess franco though you'll need better spanish than mine to understand it unless i'm much mistaken it's neither dubbed nor sub titled and it points out that the person <UNK> the character played by franco is wilson disguised using a <UNK> kind of ironic given that s he had had the requisite <UNK> <UNK> removed
<START> i first saw this in the 70s on <UNK> tv and admired its production values which were high tech for the time the <UNK> video is rich and colorful far more intense then the pale 35 <UNK> tv <UNK> this movie deserves more attention it <UNK> the way for <UNK> space 1999 and even star wars with its detailed <UNK> and cleverly conceived <UNK> sure the story of an alternative anti matter planet earth has been recycled a hundred times since star trek but the beauty of this film is its self conscious european flair for design from the rolls <UNK> space <UNK> to the euro <UNK> business paper or as it was called in europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of europe in space in the shadow of the <UNK> <UNK> and sylvia <UNK> ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the american astronaut finally realizes that he is on the <UNK> earth and everything is literally downhill after the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sequence a mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great barry gray the john williams of britain
<START> this is the story of a news investigator who hates his job which prove why actors even as weak as tom cruise and denzel washington are on the big screen and your neighbors are not br br i'll say this though the better moments show some basis for being really funny not just wacky to keep trying maybe taking some classes and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie dude where's my car and the scary movie sequence have it all over this college attempt br br the lighting wasn't the production wasn't and the script had moments the conversation from space very nice try <UNK> executed this reminded me of dark star which is about being lost in space but this movie is just lost br br the talent was the bartender he said so annoyingly that i knew he had to be acting wasn't he now that's acting the mark <UNK> guy and marty i guess i gave the movie a point for each one of them 3 10 br br <UNK> br br br br my faith http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i completely understand the historical significance of x m but that doesn't make it a good movie to begin with the plot or what there is of it is dull and lifeless five <UNK> blast off for the moon  they get knocked off course and end up on mars huh  <UNK> looking martians throw rocks at them  they return to earth and meet a fiery death  the end believe it or not but this <UNK> plot description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is to make matters worse john character dr karl feels it necessary to give long drawn out speeches on everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons it's just a thrill a minute sarcasm intended br br looking back at x m almost 60 years later i would call the portrayal of women funny if it weren't all so sad and misguided there are a number of examples i could <UNK> but there's one exchange of dialogue just after take off between the male <UNK> pilot <UNK> played by the irritating plastic haired lloyd bridges and dr lisa van horn the only female <UNK> and the constant object of <UNK> often creepy attention that illustrates the film's attitudes toward women quite nicely br br <UNK> <UNK> i've been wondering how did a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place br br <UNK> dr van horn i suppose you think that women should only cook and <UNK> and bear children br br <UNK> <UNK> isn't that enough br br i think <UNK> should have stayed behind with the <UNK>
<START> i did not expect to enjoy this in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited knowing dylan thomas and really being <UNK> of his poetry but aware and rather <UNK> by the man i didn't feel i needed to see a <UNK> adaption of his lame <UNK> life laid bare and this was not it critical and yet <UNK> it was it made me cry <UNK> knightley was superb even with that slightly strained <UNK> accent and it is a sad tale that they tell dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> it is cillian the william of the movie a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore his challenge to with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor i this film is underrated because it was <UNK> so badly dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less and well that is how it was <UNK> it is not a film about dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it
<START> this was a very strong look at prejudice and group mentality the cast is composed of superb actors doing a remarkable job the sets are beautiful and just a bit stylized the art direction is top notch along with great cinematography the story is taut and shows how prejudice and <UNK> can <UNK> easily it is disturbing for its realistic violence and of a fairly typical community i was very impressed
<START> spoiler begin the movie focuses on three friends samantha summer phoenix chris nick <UNK> and owen aaron paul the movie starts out with sam and owen as the drug <UNK> and chris the track star as the one who takes care of them as things get increasingly worse at home for chris he asks sam what the drug is like sam is out of <UNK> and sober by this point and tells him it makes everything better chris then catches up with owen and they start using it takes chris two times till he is a full time member after some trouble with a dealer and a confession to sam she gets in again so begins the <UNK> spiral for them chris <UNK> when he breaks a promise to sam i want some of the movie to be a surprise he dies sam gets in to college to be an architect and owen gets arrested so ends the story br br spoiler ends minor spoilers throughout br br nick <UNK> is amazing he will have an oscar one day his portrayal of chris was heartbreaking he was the only one that felt real in the movie as far as drug use goes aaron paul who played owen acted as if he were on speed not heroin summer phoenix was fine she is talented but what can i say nick <UNK> stole the movie his drugged eyes his slow movements everything was perfect br br the writers needed to show in the movie that is a main reason why people don't want to quit other then that there are hilarious scenes the mall scene and the <UNK> boy scene man <UNK> nailed the reactions right on the head touching sad scenes like the scene between sam and chris in her bedroom after he gets beat up i and the park scene it was realistic too like s am using again when chris wanted to <UNK> the drug down the toilet and chris using again after he goes to even though he had been clean for two weeks the pull was too strong it is all realistic br br watch the movie for a great cast great music and a semi truthful account of drug addiction
<START> now please move on because that's getting on my nerves br br seriously the man behind brilliant pieces like my own private <UNK> and to die for and others not so brilliant movies i e the unnecessary psycho remake started an experimental phase with <UNK> which reached its peak with the thought provoking elephant last days had some interesting aspects but was very uneven while paranoid park his new film also has good looking 15 year olds walking around and not much else some cool references to fellini the soundtrack some beautiful pieces by <UNK> and the elegant cinematography by the legendary christopher doyle in the mood for love are the highlights but the movie is just too artsy <UNK> and meaningless for its own doom we've had much better coming of age stories and paranoid park brings nothing new i don't see anything artistic about seeing excessive shots of <UNK> in his underwear or <UNK> or when and 13 year old taylor <UNK> the little girl from how the grinch stole christmas who plays his <UNK> girlfriend have sex for the first time just because she felt like they had to do it and after they're done she calls her friend to say how amazing it was and you can say from face how traumatic it was everybody knows that they're starting earlier and earlier nowadays movies like thirteen and even elephant itself which shows how lost their minds are in general not only when it comes to sexuality have done a better portrayal of that gus tries to be <UNK> and artistic but the final result is just boring and uninteresting his next project milk a biopic about harvey milk starring sean penn will hopefully bring the good old gus back because frankly this obsession over <UNK> kids is almost creepy 4 5 10
<START> hey remember when hal hartley was brilliant what a time that was i'd say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went <UNK> from this one a movie that looks like it was filmed on someone's cell phone wouldn't have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartley's spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a <UNK> <UNK> in a trying to be hip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half it's never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley
<START> kennedy miller could hardly have done a better job at <UNK> a very challenging exercise making dry political events work as human drama and providing an even handed representation of <UNK> controversial subject matter br br the key to its success on the first count is brilliant acting although i was less impressed by max performance as <UNK> than some other <UNK> here the clear <UNK> for my money were john <UNK> as malcolm <UNK> and bill hunter as rex connor the latter must have been one of the <UNK> casting choices in history hunter could not have been more perfect for the role on the second count the series avoids the myth of <UNK> trap through a narrator who the <UNK> of the director phillip who more recently demonstrated his left wing <UNK> in rabbit proof fence while being carefully even handed and sympathetic in its dramatic portrayal of all parties the <UNK> to the lady kerr lady <UNK> theme popular among labor <UNK> was perhaps a little partial though not <UNK> so in particular credit is due for the sympathy shown to kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position he was placed in whatever one might think of his actions br br however there is one sour note for which the producers were perhaps not entirely to blame the portrayal of the jim <UNK> affair those who come to the series with no background to these events will get the impression that <UNK> and were the innocent victims of a <UNK> campaign by a <UNK> <UNK> press the producers may have been restrained in this respect by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> laws and the recently demonstrated <UNK> of <UNK> and to use them against those who suggested their relationship was sexual which <UNK> would eventually admit to a year before his death however more could have been made of the bizarre fashion in which managed office as <UNK> br br speaking of <UNK> there are a couple of <UNK> occasions where dialogue is <UNK> due to taken out by offended principals by a <UNK> noise on one occasion and a very loud <UNK> ring on another a further curiosity the dvd release a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer played by the late paul serves on his arrival at sydney airport next in the <UNK> is a <UNK> looking hippie who now receives only a <UNK> <UNK> from when he presents his <UNK> in the original version said something along the lines of drug bust in <UNK> eh obviously this line no longer rings true in the wake of the <UNK> <UNK> case which dramatically illustrated that those <UNK> for drugs in <UNK> can expect far worse than <UNK>
<START> i remember watching this when it was made and thinking it was brilliant at the time watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later i still think is brilliant and much better than the us film that was based on this drama br br it should also be watched by all our come today gone tomorrow politicians who think they can win the war on drugs as the issues raised in this film are as <UNK> today as they were back then at the end of the 80s and unless they change their <UNK> will be so in another 20 years br br well written well made beautifully acted and superbly filmed a thought provoking drama that entertains as well as brings to light some of the hard realities of the criminal drug trade
<START> <UNK> acted and completely laughable haunted house horror flick that has an out of place anna <UNK> playing a neurotic teenager fighting off the things that go <UNK> in the dark that are <UNK> her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in spain little more than a <UNK> re planted rip off of the shining and most notably the others the weak plotted darkness is basically your typical run of the mill b horror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by audiences a mile off so to speak in retrospect i suppose i shouldn't have set my personal expectations quite as high for this movie to actually be good considering the well known fact that it was <UNK> for nearly three years before finally being released around christmas of last year in american cinemas across the country to what was ultimately <UNK> ticket sales and very harsh reviews from critics when will filmmakers ever learn that there's more to making movies be it horror or otherwise than just the <UNK> possibility of a little financial gain turkey zero stars
<START> i was a little to old for this show i was 6 when it first came out first off when i was a young child there were a few children's shows that were on <UNK> street which i did watch and learned from but other than that there wasn't much else my cousins were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one more came latter barney was a very big part of what they watched when i first saw this show i told my grandmother how it doesn't teach anything just uses magic to fix everything i was 9 at the time how many 9 years old have any idea what is really going on with a tv show more and more that i saw or heard what the <UNK> of barney were the more and more i told people how bad the show was the funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the mid to late 80's which was me by the way they agreed and said the same thing as i did the sad thing about this is my cousins who are older now 13 and such still agree with what they saw its not cheating its creative its not right to think differently than what someone tells you to its o k to steal if the person wont find out or mind that it is gone lets be honest with ourselves barney is out to make money not teach children anything the more flashy the program the more inclined children will be to watching it children are stupid not because they are not educated they just do not know any better second barney put on a show and parents bought it i never believed that tv could affect people the way barney does if you have a young child read to them watch a show that teaches them numbers do not let them get involved in this show barney is like smoking once is to much smoke a few and your hooked let your kid watch this show they are hooked and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought
<START> this film was the worst film i have ever seen it was a complete waste of money if i had not been in the cinema was my two young cousins who also thought it was disappointing but not as terrible as i thought i would have left the cinema there were two points in the film that i almost laughed but the rest of it was either boring ridiculous or painful i thought it would be a spoof on all superhero movies which i love but in fact it was mainly based on <UNK> with a few <UNK> references to other superhero movies such as fantastic four and batman i really cannot think of one good thing to say about this film do not waste your money with this film there are many other better films out there
<START> i bought this dvd as part of a set of 50 historic classics it's hardly a classic and as the plot was updated to the time of its release is not historic either the actual title on the dvd is <UNK> and additionally subtitled the private life of <UNK> sharp myrna loy is not very convincing although in her defense she is <UNK> with an awful script and trite dialogue as with many early <UNK> and especially ones made by smaller studios there is little skill demonstrated by the cast and crew loy does wear a few <UNK> that are quite stylish but her costumes and make up in the later scenes are overdone the one saving grace is a tolerable performance by billy <UNK> who plays one of her many <UNK>
<START> i decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on imdb it is <UNK> that john woo a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre american years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest made in us films plans to remake it well here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever the plot of the film is simple and even clichéd by today's standards but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads unique direction by cinematography music and its style there is no way any director today can make such film it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's box office targeted movie business br br john woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from <UNK> le <UNK> the killer but remember it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive in <UNK> but cheap in acting merits actors so what i'm saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made together with another film by <UNK> le <UNK> watch it and even if the remake will be made try to avoid it before seeing the great original first
<START> renowned czech actor mostly known in north america for his leading role as <UNK> in the original <UNK> german czech production of <UNK> the liar der 1974 gives us a last brilliant performance as a 80 year old <UNK> who refuses to admit that he is about to die br br <UNK> screenplay is exquisite funny moving and well developed it explores well both the subject of advanced old age and the motivations of characters that are <UNK> strong and fragile happy and <UNK> br br <UNK> and his best friend <UNK> are up to all types of <UNK> and are making sure to make the best out of their dying days meanwhile wife is preparing for their death saving up for funeral money and <UNK> <UNK> for his endless <UNK> and irresponsible attitude their son is about to take their apartment over and put them into a retirement home but <UNK> doesn't want to hear any of that he wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh he wants to help and love and give but at what cost br br sure to <UNK> adults of all ages this fine piece of film by talented director <UNK> is both touching and funny it makes you think of how we live our lives and why we live our lives it brings the simple story of a charming stubborn old man to the <UNK> and allow us to reflect and feel what life is all about br br after an active career lasting more than 40 years it is somewhat <UNK> to know that died in april 2002 no longer in the grip of <UNK> cancer it is however uplifting to think that he had the chance to be a part of such a moving script and to be the <UNK> of this <UNK> to <UNK> old age that has not even started to make the waves it is about to create in north american <UNK> cinema br br after the international success of jan divided we fall 2000 it is starting to be clear that czech cinema has indeed something to offer to the world this film at least is a must see
<START> a wonderful semi humorous homage to <UNK> black and white films of folks like <UNK> <UNK> fritz lang carl <UNK> marcel <UNK> and others allen plays a character caught in a <UNK> nightmare at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect the writing is a little forced this is after all woody allen trying to be a <UNK> <UNK> but the point is made and no harm done the cinematography is interesting about 100 shades of gray but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen or details will get <UNK> in the fog this is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually <UNK> of uh huh the acting is fine considering the odd vehicle and it's worth watching if you are big woody allen fan also of interest to those <UNK> about <UNK> films i'd give this a 6 5 out of 10
<START> there were but two reasons for me to see this film first of all <UNK> and marisa tomei were in it who are both good actors and i had nothing better to do while seeing the film though i immediately thought of something better to do sleep this film is a complete waste of time it is a standard ex cop flick the ex <UNK> is the best there ever was but he was fired he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day all big surprises not go to sleep or if you have insomnia try this one br br 4 out of 10
<START> although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release i feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast the issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough especially when looking at the mini film br br i also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable the issues are still crucial but boys from the cannot fully aid the cause of understanding the problems in britain in the 1980s
<START> this has got to be one of <UNK> best productions i completely disagree with the comments made by br br this series shows the depth of australian and the <UNK> they went to to help each other out episode five is a great example of this and it really captures the australian spirit br br the music used throughout the series only <UNK> the situation that the men were faced with their longing for home and their loved ones the numerous amusing <UNK> of the road to captures the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home and that it was little elements such as the singing of a song that took them home for a short while br br as for the comment about it being racist towards japanese people the only thing to be said is that you can't change what happened the japanese did treat the <UNK> very poorly in and to represent it as otherwise would be very misleading indeed the comment about the screenplay being in accurate is also false these six stories that are told in the series are composed from real p o w experiences br br the actors were superb the best being in my opinion matthew <UNK> his performance as david in the first episode was gut wrenching from being a city boy to being another <UNK> face to his <UNK> we see him change dramatically in the first episode because of his violent attack in the jungle and in further episodes we can see how that one event has changed him he is more aware of what is really going on and is always one of the first to help out the other members of the secret nine br br stephen <UNK> also deserves a mention his performance in is amazing going from the <UNK> of the group to being sick weak and unable to take care of himself the displays of in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud to be australian br br i study wwii at university level and have found this series if not physically truthful <UNK> truthful as it captures the true spirit of what it was to be an australian soldier br br well done to john doyle for capturing the spirit of
<START> we also found this movie on the <UNK> rack and made the mistake of <UNK> it because sandra <UNK> was featured on the cover the cinematography was terrible and the back of the dvd box told more about the plot than the movie itself oh and i love the <UNK> <UNK> not br br
<START> based on book this second <UNK> movie ever made is full of rich color beautiful music and <UNK> spectacle the plot sometimes gets muddled in <UNK> <UNK> but all in all it has a strong social content man is ruled by his emotions and that every action has an equal consequence but to truly enjoy this film first see the movie then read the book although different it <UNK> light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen and gives breath to some more of the depth of
<START> i am from texas and live very close to where the actual deaths occurred so i might be a bit biased in saying that wasted is a film that you just can't get out of your head br br <UNK> phoenix and paul all play their characters very realistically you truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin <UNK> the drug content is handled very <UNK> as well although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose and each moment the characters spiral further <UNK> is heartbreaking i definitely recommend this film to anyone once you watch it it sticks with you
<START> batman returns is more gothic and somber than its predecessor and i like it a lot also the scenery is more darker and the entire environment is <UNK> along with the soul chilling music composed by the so talented danny <UNK> br br however i didn't like the idea to make the penguin a monster unlike to the comic books where he's human even if he looks like a monster he shows well that he possesses a human dignity and i felt very sorry for him when he saw the <UNK> of his late parents but still he was a dangerous villain in fact and he needed to be stopped br br michael keaton made a tour de force with his return as the dark knight and this time he's powerful as in the original batman it's not difficult to understand why he's called batman in public sometimes br br also michelle pfeiffer is so sexy and well <UNK> in her role and she gave a <UNK> performance as the female villain <UNK> dressed as a cat really the actors did all a masterful work with batman returns which made it a successful movie br br if you liked batman watch its awesome sequel cause it's very worthy for all the dark <UNK> hard core lovers br br steve
<START> i had to get this movie since it didn't come to where i live i waited <UNK> and it was worth the wait i totally fell in love with this movie the chemistry between <UNK> and you could see since they also worked together on the harry potter movies the woman who plays his overbearing righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a <UNK> she is i think she did a great job playing the role i only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it lol but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down <UNK> i totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch rent this movie i do have to say that rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see that he's doing movies outside of harry potter even though i totally love him as ron the whole cast did a great job and i hope rupert continues to act outside of harry potter to <UNK> his skill
<START> spoilers spoilers there's not much that can be said about this early <UNK> era flick i'm <UNK> to call <UNK> a film because i feel that the word is too <UNK> but what can be said about it mainly speaks against it br br take for example the <UNK> of portraying indians as bad folk in one scene the little boy of the <UNK> lead character an overbearing and over ambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business is playing just outside of his father's office an indian <UNK> down in front of the child hello the boy says to the indian in a very polite manner the indian gives him a <UNK> stands up and walks off br br <UNK> <UNK> jr <UNK> runs inside the office <UNK> <UNK> he shouts holding up the gift look what an indian gave me br br how many times do i have to tell you she <UNK> at the boy you aren't ever to talk to those filthy indians br br <UNK> <UNK> sr richard <UNK> comes across as a man who speaks with a <UNK> tongue at the start of the story he seems to have a definite plan for giving his family a better life but we soon enough discover he's no great over much less a totally good moral minded man his slave child <UNK> eugene jackson is one tell tale sign of this br br upon his family's first trek to a sunday morning church service one br br at which curiously enough <UNK> is to give the <UNK> <UNK> tries to come along dressed up like <UNK> long tail suit <UNK> gun and all <UNK> tells him to go home <UNK> all doesn't want me to come with <UNK> <UNK> church <UNK> says with a <UNK> br br no <UNK> <UNK> him <UNK> him on the shoulder you don't understand i want you to stay and guard the house and if anyone at all comes along you shoot him dead br br the characters not to mention the actors in <UNK> couldn't br br act their way out of <UNK> <UNK> despite their obvious efforts and nothing in the script was any too commendable either granted the <UNK> <UNK> may oliver notorious for playing the red queen in alice in wonderland also released in 1931 actually manages to look good pulling off her portrayal of a pompous old woman which is what she's also been best known for but aside from that well br br <UNK> <UNK> isn't popular in town from the first week he arrives br br and one of the <UNK> decides to shoot white hat off as he and his wife irene dunne are casually walking by despite her anger with the man who fired the bullet <UNK> just takes it completely in <UNK> br br not only was this story not shooting for realism but it was very br br lacking in several key areas e g newspaper isn't ever really seen <UNK> and posters yes but not any newspaper br br perhaps strangest of all though this is set in a small town in br br kansas yet for some reason or other <UNK> <UNK> is dead set on br br calling his paper the <UNK> wig br br really good westerns have always been very few and far between the only exceptions being clint eastwood's so called spaghetti westerns of the late '60s to early '70s cliche westerns on the other hand are a dime a dozen br br if you like cliche westerns <UNK> will do you proud but as for me it did me embarrassment br br
<START> i was so disappointed in this movie i am very familiar with the case having read not only mark book but also the far superior a wealth of evil the true story of the murder of martha in america's <UNK> community by timothy <UNK> anyone who watches murder in <UNK> should be aware they're watching the mark story not the martha story this film is nothing more than an ego trip for just watch his character <UNK> around as if he is the second coming yes even being by women the actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing if there is any hero to this story it's <UNK> family her mother dorothy and brother john they kept this case alive for two decades before walked into it in order to make a name for himself they and martha deserve to have the true story told
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in ages i watched for about 20 minutes slightly puzzled by what was going on then i started to laugh and didn't stop <UNK> long after the movie ended such deadpan satire is rare indeed christopher guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves about 90 of white <UNK> males to start with as in waiting for <UNK> guest nails middle america's idiotic self importance to the wall i can hardly wait for his next film
<START> this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i've seen in a long time br br it's <UNK> as as sci fi when in fact it's nothing more than a christian <UNK> tool br br it tells you quite a bit about the state of the christian church when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch but then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great <UNK> to help protect such an enormous amount of child in their organization br br religion is full of nothing but sexual <UNK> <UNK> and war <UNK> let's not forget our bumbling former president actually came out and said that god told him to <UNK> iraq and nobody <UNK> if he was hearing voices or seeing things br br anyway going of the subject here no this movie has nothing to do with <UNK> whatsoever it's nothing more than a religious production
<START> this movie was just plain bad i can forgive low budget films for being low budget but it wasn't funny it wasn't smart it had no redeeming qualities at all unless you really like looking at fake boobs i don't know what this genre is classified as possibly erotic horror but if so well it's neither sexy nor scary <UNK> it into the <UNK> party massacre movies was useless i'd never seen the previous movies myself and except for one scene that attempted to tie it together i had no way of knowing who the escaped psycho killer in was or why they were bothering with including him especially because and i don't think i'm revealing anything here it was really obvious that the <UNK> killer in this film wasn't him as for the actual murderer all i can say is lame really lame when you find out why the killer is <UNK> the <UNK> squad and the coach and two <UNK> who happened to be on the bus trip they're taking and the bus driver just for the heck of it apparently you will sit there and go wtf worst excuse for a murdering spree ever the actors two <UNK> why i added the quotes generally looked like low budget porn rejects which they most likely were those poor people trying to break into legitimate film one of my friends had this to say about the actor who played <UNK> the bus driver he looks like the guy who you know gets really into it and his face gets all red and stuff we had a good at that half of the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors in the sixth grade production of annie i just saw the other half pretty much seemed bored to death especially in the deleted scene this one <UNK> and by ten minutes into this movie i was too br br a note the dvd contains one deleted scene which would've put the movie from r rated to <UNK> 17 if it had been left in it was entirely gratuitous and as adult entertainment goes of no quality whatsoever the only reason to bother with it is to laugh a lot at the badness
<START> the commercials for rat race made it look too juvenile for me to enjoy but since my boyfriend <UNK> this movie and the soundtrack i finally <UNK> and watched it with him tonight i make him watch david lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff i recently forced <UNK> on him so i felt i <UNK> him an <UNK> hollywood product br br i didn't want to hurt his feelings so i saved my <UNK> for yeah rat race has its moments but a great deal of it irritated me let's start at the beginning rat race was <UNK> as a family film so i was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie i can hear it now <UNK> what does <UNK> <UNK> mean this scene has no purpose in this movie other than to <UNK> some <UNK> into a pg 13 movie br br and while we're still on the segments in the casino it's pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play within the same time frame the <UNK> that held the gold <UNK> what would have happened if they didn't would those millionaire <UNK> just sit around and wait and how did they get those gold <UNK> in the <UNK> in the first place br br but i'm a plot point that's necessary for the movie to exist so i'll press on about whoopi and her long lost daughter they're meeting for the very first time yet throughout their whole ordeal they don't discuss with each other anything about themselves why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one couldn't they have just been say a mother and daughter on vacation together why the business concerning a long ago <UNK> and why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman <UNK> to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character <UNK> br br this illustrates the main weakness of this movie the characters are inconsistent and <UNK> it's <UNK> when everyone is equally zany and with no <UNK> traits and another thing the events aren't plausible oh sure the characters can do some quirky things but the characters themselves have to be believable take the naked gun another jerry <UNK> movie for example frank has some pretty exaggerated moments but everything he does is in theory possible in his world jane is also funny but it's a different kind of funny which makes all the difference a character in rat race <UNK> natural laws by <UNK> onto a <UNK> train destroys any <UNK> the movie may have these clearly aren't real people so why should i care about them br br another problem i have with rat race is a moral one the characters obtain their <UNK> of transport almost totally by <UNK> i know i know this is just a silly comedy and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when i saw million dollar mystery but there's a lot of in rat race and it bothers me now and i won't delve into the whole airport <UNK> sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didn't consider the real life <UNK> of such an action was that scene funny before 9 11 br br i'll skip over the <UNK> bits concerning the heart the <UNK> of one's family and the nazis whose <UNK> and payoff worked better in an episode of seinfeld and move on to complain about the acting <UNK> <UNK> started out annoying and ended <UNK> i don't know when i liked a comical character less and the three oscar winners need new agents whoopi came off best but she didn't have much to work with loved the <UNK> <UNK> and purple <UNK> though kathy <UNK> part was shrill but mercifully brief cuba was oh man cuba babe please fire your agent following instinct and chill factor this is your third strike be glad i haven't seen pearl harbor or snow dogs it's time to give your <UNK> best supporting actor oscar back to its <UNK> owner edward norton for primal fear an actor of your stature has no business running half naked through the desert and being checked out by a <UNK> lucille ball <UNK> do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at random br br there's other small points that bother me how did <UNK> and the hooker get to the <UNK> so fast but basically rat race amounts to little more than your basic <UNK> of character types being <UNK> by <UNK> obstacles on their way to a rather <UNK> and inexplicable ending they give the money to charity what kind of ending is that yeah it's the noble thing to do never mind the <UNK> of cross promotion <UNK> <UNK> smash mouth do they ever say no to selling out putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the new mexico desert but who would honestly do such a thing yes they say it's the journey not the destination that makes a trip worthwhile but there's no journey without a destination if there was ever an example of a wrong happy ending this would be it what a <UNK> end to a movie that despite my <UNK> here i did enjoy parts of i confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue <UNK> at first i thought his <UNK> speech would run me up a wall but he grew to be my favorite br br but as far as my boyfriend knows i found rat race quite funny and charming br br
<START> warning may contain spoilers let <UNK> help mario lead the way and smile because this game will <UNK> your day br br <UNK> stars will require luck and skill but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill br br <UNK> through stars show mario and <UNK> and what <UNK> they now are br br walking upside down has never been more fun especially a final battle with near the sun br br this is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in <UNK> hall of fame
<START> what on earth like watching an episode of <UNK> after drinking two <UNK> of <UNK> medicine nightmarish and making no sense at all i was waiting for the clever part where everything fits into place and saves the film maybe it was there and i just missed it or was lost on me br br my strongest suspicion is that it is a <UNK> <UNK> attempt to market a new drug thats about to hit the streets i wouldn't say don't watch it but i will say its pretty poor on every level like am in high <UNK> <UNK> unless you drink two <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> then it's just dandy
<START> so forgive the really lame game play scene cardboard background and studio like stadium for this part i should have give the movie 5 instead of 7 but read on br br from the premise to plot there is a lot similarities with the <UNK> some say this movie rip off the <UNK> while some say this script wrote before it br br both movies require some sort of suspension of disbelief on the basic premise and this is especially difficult for second string since it has <UNK> license team and all the history behind it food poison excuse may sound too lame for some people and not to mention in second string bills has to overcome big scores again and again with the limit budget in shooting the game play scene this make it look even bad br br in <UNK> the premise and the league is fictional yet you know it happen in real life i believe it is easier to accept fictional story and setting with real event oh yeah this happen before rather than real setting background with fictional scenario there is no way bill can win a <UNK> some of the scene were actually shoot in pre season game of <UNK> games real stadium real audience and some <UNK> match alike shooting angle br br but let say both movies came out on the same day and we <UNK> the budget factor thus forgive the game play action scene overall i like second string over <UNK> not by much but i like this more br br it has relatively better character development in <UNK> keanu character is too out sync with the world and all he care is maybe get a girl in second string you see the struggle of the from getting the job back and deal with his past with coach or the <UNK> guy problem this hold the ball all day long solution of course is not new but we see progression in <UNK> it br br how about those trick play i think it is relatively realistic than <UNK> the dan <UNK> like fake <UNK> pass flea <UNK> wild cat full back rush all real except sometimes this look a bit too easy but for me it is better than replacement 's center catch and <UNK> for 50 <UNK> call or how a 60 <UNK> field goal look too easy oh btw i am glad they didn't force the <UNK> <UNK> made his shot br br of course if you <UNK> review this movie over other football movies all there this could easily be a 5 out of 10 movie but some say this is the worse football movie try the <UNK>
<START> some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure i loved this flick but i don't feel guilty about it you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie but jack frost 2 won't go over well with some people right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it well if you get the <UNK> to watch this movie after watching it remember that jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure not a guilty pleasure now because i can't fill up ten lines <UNK> some great scenes br br spoilers br br the three women on the beach had great deaths the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop <UNK> on one of them he kept missing so he dropped an <UNK> on her the next woman fell on a bed of <UNK> the last one was stabbed in the eyes with <UNK> br br the other great one was where two surfers <UNK> are hanging out near a frozen pole one of them gets their tongue stuck on it of course jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying tongue a dude well you have to see it for yourself br br and of course the <UNK> children kicked ass br br end spoilers br br <UNK> stars
<START> this film is sometimes called 'the story of o <UNK> <UNK> which tries to pass itself off as a sequel of sorts to the french erotic s m thriller 'the story of <UNK> although i've never seen the original version i did however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual social politics i guess the <UNK> angle comes from the occasional s m overtones which were never as explicit and unpleasant to watch as the ones in <UNK> kinski is the only recognizable face in this french japanese production but speaks his lines in english at least in the version i saw the unnecessary use of <UNK> only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water it's obvious that after the whole porno <UNK> trend in cinema <UNK> out <UNK> sorry bad pun about 1975 producers had to <UNK> the bottom of the barrel trying to please the <UNK> of adult cinema not to mention foreign art cinema so film goers had to <UNK> with dreck like 'the last <UNK> and others like it
<START> this is such a <UNK> and studied film a classic among hitchcock's many it takes no <UNK> to want to watch it again yet you think can it hold up even when the huge and clever and amazing trick of the plot is no surprise br br yes br br and for starters there is the start a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story the <UNK> of it two <UNK> two men shown with their shoes each walking onto the train sitting then across from each other and <UNK> a mistake a little <UNK> and the conversation begins and we see the men themselves they are <UNK> br br the tone here is characteristic of hitchcock as it is in many horror and suspense films <UNK> and light we know entering the film however that this won't be the case so already we are worried what after all is about to go wrong br br a lot in truly hitchcock fashion it is a purely innocent man nearly always a man who faces injustice who is trapped by <UNK> threatening what is most valuable to him the innocent in this case <UNK> player guy <UNK> is played with an innocence that is believable his <UNK> <UNK> in that first scene for example as he realizes the other man is a little <UNK> is just what you or i might do the not so innocent man is the self absorbed and <UNK> intelligent spoiled child bruno anthony played with utter brilliance by robert walker this uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another hitchcock <UNK> played by anthony <UNK> in psycho so from scene one on the train and the train really gorgeous we have the two leads and we have the mind blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot from the first novel by patricia <UNK> who also wrote the books behind the two mr <UNK> movies and it doesn't hurt that the screenplay was co written by raymond chandler himself who knows something about economy and clever dialog and crime br br and of course there is more than just the first scene what to note well that <UNK> of a <UNK> daughter i thought she was terrific is hitchcock's daughter patricia who is still with us as of 2009 she also had a role in psycho and there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film the <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> known to us as the site of the u s open the fantastic last full scene with the <UNK> is the only place where hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage building up the suspense by making it surreal the fear gets positively with the laughing children and the old man <UNK> underneath it all and when it <UNK> in a crash that's all on a set one of the more <UNK> uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back <UNK> br br the photography is that perfect hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized as in some noir films that it is an object in its own right look again at the first scene or the shooting and editing of <UNK> entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder this is sophisticated construction when we are not completely surprised that it's bruno in the bed that only proves that the director has us on our <UNK> something unexpected is always expected br br are there <UNK> who knows it depends on what kind of <UNK> you can accept or embrace as beautiful style the scene where bruno is <UNK> the old woman at a party is both brilliant the woman played by norma is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away and marred by his looking at the <UNK> daughter and being <UNK> into a deadly <UNK> by her glasses and her resemblance to his earlier victim this is a mid 20th century idea of psychology that <UNK> on many of hitchcock's efforts the end of psycho for starters br br the <UNK> article on the film <UNK> <UNK> the consistent <UNK> of things in the movie from the main characters to the murder victim and the <UNK> daughter this echoes in lots of little ways two men trail him to the <UNK> court two men <UNK> the victim to the amusement park and so on there can be too much made of this but it does supply an aesthetic <UNK> above and below our consciousness don't forget there are meant to be two murders it is the lack of the second murder the inability to create a <UNK> in that case that causes bruno to unravel br br walker the actor had emotional problems and was <UNK> in the year before this movie was shot and just afterwards he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his <UNK> though he appeared in other films strangers on a train is easily his tour de force <UNK> granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom though his style can have a peculiar nervous <UNK> that really works especially in they live by night br br and if you watch this one for the first or third time do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the <UNK> match where the <UNK> heads all move back and forth in <UNK> except for <UNK> he is staring out without moving his head straight at us as the trailer for the movie says after this movie you won't be talking to strangers on a train
<START> <UNK> hyde starts like any other normal day for individual jackie hyde co producer <UNK> hall until her boss robert <UNK> fires her for taking personal calls at work however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer <UNK> her that her grandfather malcolm bennett has recently died that he left her his mansion fortune why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me sigh very excited jackie heads on over there makes herself right at home while looking for the <UNK> late one night jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her grandfather <UNK> the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance being a bit on the <UNK> side jackie finally <UNK> on the glamorous <UNK> <UNK> however <UNK> better looking alter ego starts to take control br br written co produced directed by <UNK> <UNK> i thought <UNK> hyde was complete total utter crap from start to finish it's as simple straight forward as that according to the opening credits <UNK> hyde was by the classic robert louis stevenson novel 'the strange case of dr <UNK> and mr frankly if mr stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he'd turn in his grave for a start i think <UNK> hyde was is intended to be a horror film the imdb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is i would say that <UNK> hyde is more a soft core porno than anything else extremely tame with it why sit down watch this <UNK> than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard core stuff that actually delivers the goods why that's the question i ask here it's not even good porn either besides being far too soft it's dull boring the not worth mentioning sex scenes are few far between the most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the <UNK> hyde 1998 title during the last century judging by the <UNK> plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish this is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity br br director <UNK> was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap the few instances of cgi look like they came from a <UNK> <UNK> the final <UNK> twist has probably the worst <UNK> effect i've ever seen is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when <UNK> breasts grow via more terrible cgi that's another thing the film takes itself far too seriously the subject matter sucks is far too predictable makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch alas it isn't so it isn't forget about any decent horror violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly <UNK> <UNK> at the end br br technically <UNK> hyde is home made film type stuff the photography is of the flat hand held point shoot variety the music production design special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script the acting was awful seriously this is bad br br <UNK> hyde in my opinion a load of crap there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that i can think of any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap definitely one to avoid
<START> <UNK> i mean <UNK> i mean <UNK> <UNK> br br i saw this movie <UNK> back when i was eight in 1996 back then cgi films were a <UNK> and good ones even more so also back then we listened to things called cd players but i <UNK> i used to like this movie a lot way back then and up till viewing it again i've held <UNK> fond memories of it hey it's don <UNK> anyone who hates all dogs go to heaven is clearly a robot but again i <UNK> br br then i saw it again this really isn't one of his best i can say now eleven years later i've seen a lot more films and i've garnered a little bit more knowledge now sure the voice acting is good i'll give 'em that story's okay i mean we see it all the time a lot but it works the musical numbers are what <UNK> me this would've been more at home in the eighties with these kind of musical numbers in <UNK> most kids movies had epic numbers like the lion king which came out a year or so previous but whatever or stuff like that you get <UNK> here vaudeville style br br the animation kind of hurts too at times choppy and at others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot it's really hard not to notice br br i still like all dogs go to heaven but this could've been <UNK> better br br 4 10
<START> as a zombie fan i really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters <UNK> is also an excellent tie in to chronicles of <UNK> <UNK> the gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness there are so many <UNK> in the story <UNK> is this bad guy but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow paced folks the muslim guy <UNK> relies on the <UNK> positions for the five times a day <UNK> but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule overall i recommend this film to any sci fi fans you won't be disappointed
<START> steven <UNK> movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema i have been <UNK> bored with every one of them as soon as i realized that they were even more unrealistic than jean claude has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit i mean give me something to root for a hard fought battle with a bad guy who's scary twenty years and he's still filming the same fight scenes fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act the boring choreography of a segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief worse yet he's woefully out of shape just what we need a fat stiff who thinks he's a leading man there's not one <UNK> of redeeming cinematic value in all this movies ninety or so minutes do not watch this unless you feel like throwing away an hour and a half of your life
<START> a beautiful film john <UNK> character is a distant relative of les <UNK> 's jean <UNK> while detective <UNK> recalls victor <UNK> <UNK> the ruthless arm of law br br like in many films <UNK> the city <UNK> evil whereas the country and the nature represents <UNK> redemption and a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomed but even in the <UNK> daylight danger may appear suddenly as the excellent scene at the <UNK> shows john garfield an actor who as leonard <UNK> points out should be <UNK> i've never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in <UNK> <UNK> but it was not his fault gives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is <UNK> accused the first sequence shows a rather <UNK> <UNK> person but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective <UNK> colorful characters grandma and the kids add a lot of <UNK> de <UNK> which is necessary humor is also present in the strip poker game as the dead end <UNK> <UNK> a rich kid br br i recommend this movie
<START> it's hard to believe that oprah <UNK> produced this piece of junk the show couldn't even hold a candle to cooking shows of the past including <UNK> ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show host in tv history not since has had a terrible cooking show host i've watched at least has some good moments and some style this one has no style at all she's terrible as host the kitchen looks atrocious the writing is horrible the <UNK> is over the top and the opening credits are so bad it makes me sick now i enjoy cooking shows that had a cool sense of style but this has absolutely none of that br br this is one of the worst tv of the year
<START> three distinct and distant <UNK> lives <UNK> with the brutal killing of one by another the one hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over i have seen other segments of the but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure br br the film opens with a law student practicing a mock <UNK> of defense for a man charged with murder obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full <UNK> lawyer but this is never shown on screen at least in the short 1 <UNK> version of 5 we are made to imagine that this must have been the case a cab driver who is a <UNK> has two <UNK> to his character the good side <UNK> a <UNK> dog <UNK> his cab <UNK> picks up dirty <UNK> thrown by people who lack <UNK> sense and remembers his wife while dying the bad side <UNK> small <UNK> refuses to give a ride to a drunk probably worried that he will <UNK> in the cab and <UNK> at pretty girls the repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic and pushes strangers into without any <UNK> is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh <UNK> film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters br br yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a <UNK> on killing the fifth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not kill is explored <UNK> even god <UNK> cain ' <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> to children and poor <UNK> dogs and psychologically after effects of drunken night with a male friend that led to the accidental death of his sister whose photograph he carries with him what makes ordinary persons turn into killers this is never fully explained but <UNK> are legion br br in <UNK> world there is a pattern where events and people are <UNK> in a <UNK> sense note the resemblance of clown to the killer as it hangs from the mirror in the cab <UNK> and the young <UNK> lawyer seem to ask us to look at the <UNK> literally and <UNK> why do we kill are the people <UNK> killed truly bad is there a force beyond society the drunken night that led to life of a girl that makes us into <UNK> murderers br br it would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two detailed killings in the film both without mercy the film invites the viewer to contemplate why we are asked by god not to kill br br i understand a longer full length version of the film was made by <UNK> but even this short 1 <UNK> version is superb with its bleak and sparse script intelligent editing interesting cinematography and top notch direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts br br this segment <UNK> the more wholesome 6 7 and 8
<START> this is the first time i'm entering a comment for a movie i haven't viewed till the credits reason for this is simple people need to be warned this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium i usually stay away from a good deal of comedies that are in bad taste but i <UNK> this to be watchable a <UNK> decision which was based on other <UNK> <UNK> comedies that were semi enjoyable such as a lot like love and guess who br br where those two movies had their charms and laughs this had none and i mean none the acting is horrible especially the <UNK> tara reid was no surprise how dare she call herself an actress the premise is thin and the plot doesn't at all not a problem if you manage to keep it funny and or sweet but as you probably already guessed this was not the cast at all the script felt like it wasn't quite finished and i wouldn't even be <UNK> if the director did some <UNK> while shooting my dog could've written a more coherent script seriously and he's not exactly <UNK> either br br stay away from this tripe even if you like silly goof ball comedies at times like i do this low quality movie will not be enjoyed by many br br i almost never give a one so therefore a 2
<START> well i must say i initially found this short to be quite average but having watched it nearly 5 times since its constantly shown on <UNK> i've developed an enjoyment of the simple plot elements and reality of the situations presented <UNK> coppola contributes a solid addition to the category
<START> i guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term cult flick it is totally a bad movie but i can't help it i like this movie richard <UNK> has made better and so has joan van arc but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that don't make you think to much this one is for you
<START> can anyone give me a reason why only one american dies in this movie and when he does it is supposed to be a very emotional scene yet when the operation <UNK> force team kills hundreds of russians in slow motion action scenes or thousands of <UNK> also in slow motion action scenes you are supposed to cheer and say take that you non american monsters i know i used slow motion action scenes a lot but that is because every action scene in this movie is in you guessed it slow motion every last one of them and this squad should be called <UNK> slow motion bullet <UNK> force since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them to dodge bullets and if this supernatural power fails they have some kind of <UNK> <UNK> which is all they need to kill the complete non american army that stands between them and victory by this point nobody cares since they have been put to sleep by another laughable slow motion action scene that is if they are not laughing out loud at the bad acting cheesy dialogues and incredibly poor story which is what i did the cast is made of unknown actors which will probably remain unknown since they don't even play characters they are just playing guys with guns and lets not forget <UNK> the only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not that bad although they are in slow motion for a tv movie but it still sucks and at the same time is so bad it's good ok maybe at the end it gets a little too repetitive br br 25
<START> in 1984 edgar surprised film lovers all over the world with his epic <UNK> a <UNK> of germany eight years later he came up with a sequel the second <UNK> of a youth which is even more astounding than its predecessor br br actually it's not really a sequel it's more of a as it covers events that took place between the <UNK> and <UNK> episode of the first cycle br br the second begins in 1960 four years after <UNK> simon henry arnold was separated from his first love courtesy of his <UNK> mother and elder brother the controversy had to do with him being a minor while she was about 25 still <UNK> by those events the young man <UNK> never to fall in love again a <UNK> if creepy scene and decides to move to <UNK> like the director himself did in approximately the same period hoping to become a professional composer after a few years spent at the music academy he stays in <UNK> for ten years and the thirteen two hour episodes of 2 cover that time frame each of them focusing on a different person among <UNK> fellow students people who like him are searching for a second home country be it music film or something else in which they can finally live <UNK> br br like the first this second cycle is a perfect union of film and television the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera in fact the second needs to be seen in its entirety to be successfully <UNK> whereas some chapters of 1 could be viewed as separate stories in particular the one concerning <UNK> teenage years the style and content however is pure auteur cinema with the familiar black and white color transitions actually a tad more predictable this time around and ambiguous characters the latter element being <UNK> by the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> player <UNK> <UNK> they clearly love each other yet they keep <UNK> on affairs with other people <UNK> the inevitable until it's too late this time seems to be more <UNK> regarding his characters at one point <UNK> is so <UNK> he says the beatles are much better than us building entire episodes around dark controversial themes such as abortion and suicide the decade he's exploring is not suitable for everyone as some are <UNK> in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the '60s the <UNK> revolution especially br br also seems to have made this mini series specifically for movie buffs given the numerous film references including a brilliant casablanca quote and clever in jokes one episode is set in <UNK> whose film festival had an important part in the success and since 1992 film lovers have never <UNK> to thank him for delivering 26 of the most compelling hours ever committed to celluloid
<START> massive spoilers ahead ok the movie in a nutshell so this girl goes out buys drugs gets pulled over by a cop the cops name is wolf the cop feels her butt then he eats her okay he beats her up and eats her then this woman is at home and this guy come with <UNK> <UNK> and he does her up then the woman goes into the other room and this black guy is there and she <UNK> then the movie turns into a porno he starts sucking on her breasts then she gives him head then wolf walks in with blood all over him and says honey i'm home then he realizes his wife is blowing some black guy and he kills her the black guy kills him cuts the girl out of <UNK> stomach and the go home the end and they lived happily ever after that is the movie br br now after reading this do u really think there is anything to like about this movie the only thing i liked in the woman had a nice body but the performances sucked the story sucked the dialogue sucked the whole movie just sucked
<START> even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group i really enjoyed this movie it's a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star i know it was mine to be sure the first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy once you get over that you can really start to enjoy it i loved the relationship between <UNK> and jane it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other the soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well i also liked the family set up for jane her sisters seemed lovely very well made film
<START> this in name only sequel to the classic <UNK> has a <UNK> agent john <UNK> coming to the rescue of his uncle will <UNK> when the uncle is badly beaten up by a local drug gang headed by that wooden indian of an actor jake busey the gang wants to take over the poor guy's bar for <UNK> reasons patrick <UNK> is sorely missed here <UNK> is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an ass kicking <UNK> the fights here are <UNK> and not nearly as powerful or vicious as the fights in <UNK> the finale is equally weak some good looking women keep things <UNK> for a bit there is a terrific fight between a daisy duke type who turns out to be handy with both <UNK> and weapons and a nasty looking babe of <UNK> who is handy with sharp <UNK> there's also a scantily dressed gal at the beginning who is a fellow agent of <UNK> but unfortunately she never <UNK> in the film too bad she does a brief lap dance for <UNK> that had my full attention if nothing else <UNK> 2 kicks off with a strip club scene that comes <UNK> close to what a real strip club looks like a rare <UNK> in any movie the rest is <UNK> time
<START> contrary to most of the comments in this section i have to say this film just barely escapes the definition ' the only readers who seem to be aware of what a <UNK> of clichés it is are those who like me live in the north east and know at first hand what the area is like i am totally sick of films that are supposed to be <UNK> yet portray the working class of wherever as stupid criminal low <UNK> but then excuse them because of their social background and funny i <UNK> briefly twice and laughed once but that was at the <UNK> of two boy actors with accents supposedly trying to hide their <UNK> accents from football fans there was only one likable character in the whole film and that was the <UNK> grandfather played quietly but very competently by roy the only non <UNK> in the cast br br as for the writing well i just wonder what university <UNK> department the author studied at he certainly had no ear for the local accent and i too have never heard the expression and not only am i a native i'm a <UNK> who's written <UNK> on the local <UNK> br br don't waste your time and <UNK> on this garbage it isn't funny it isn't realistic it isn't entertaining and it is <UNK> <UNK>
<START> most of <UNK> most famous films are his full length features and i assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts this is really a shame as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century br br if someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of <UNK> better shorts because chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film this is great for several reasons first in <UNK> earliest films from <UNK> <UNK> his character of the little tramp is still in its earliest <UNK> or is absent altogether plus even when he is there he was often mean spirited and self centered something very alien from the little tramp we have grown to love second because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition if you watch this film you won't need to worry about watching <UNK> film with gaps and lousy musical <UNK> that doesn't fit the action a common problem br br so for a great look at <UNK> shorts at their finest give this film a chance it's sure to provide you some excellent laughs
<START> quentin in my opinion has written and directed only really one good movie and that was the multiple award winning pulp fiction however most of films especially of recent have been real real <UNK> people still rate him and his stuff today and i really can't see why there are many other directors and writers nowadays producing far better entertainment in all aspects of their movies from this point on i shall not believe the hype that is a tarantino movie br br <UNK> was too long and worse still you felt it the humor was well minimal and not that humorous the violence was nothing new minus the end scene the dialog was sometimes very very drawn out br br for some they'll love this movie and for others they'll hate it br br and i thought the subject matter of nazis was finally put to bed with the awesome 2004 german movie der <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a <UNK> famous <UNK> noir that's a murder mystery with a strong message it stars robert young robert mitchum robert ryan sam <UNK> and gloria <UNK> and is strongly directed by edward we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film young as the detective <UNK> in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why the victim joseph sam <UNK> is someone the soldiers meet in a bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and winds up dead br br i don't know about <UNK> but seeing <UNK> today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects i don't suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started nevertheless the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and anti <UNK> language br br the characterizations are vivid including that of gloria <UNK> in a role she's a woman who meets mitchell george cooper one of the suspect soldiers in a bar and can provide him with an <UNK> the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan but everyone is excellent robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife br br truly excellent and a must see
<START> this film rocks so hard br br the cameos the drug references the sharing the love the <UNK> when jack and kyle first met in tim <UNK> actors' gang theater company years ago who knew that such a legacy of awesome music and <UNK> would ensue all that door to door <UNK> paid off br br although anyone who enjoys classic rock will get a major kick out of this film i would definitely recommend renting the original 6 hbo episodes at your local video store before going to see the film in the cinema they're on the <UNK> d <UNK> dvd which is available for rent at pretty much every video store there are some inside jokes in the film that refer to these earlier episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall viewing experience
<START> i love this film dont know why it is called pot luck in england what a rubbish and entirely irrelevant name i spent 8 months in <UNK> not as an <UNK> student but living with other <UNK> so it felt just the same it brings back so many great memories of the fun i had with all the friends i made from different countries and of the city itself i really want to see the <UNK> <UNK> ' the russian dolls i'm guessing it wont be released here my brother saw it in france and said it <UNK> wasn't as good but had a lot of the same cast the brother of wendy gets married apparently anyone know anything about this film and whether it may be released
<START> maybe our standards for movies have <UNK> since born on the fourth of july full metal jacket and platoon this movie has a predictable plot bad writing bad acting bad directing bad special effects etc compared with other vietnam movies this one is completely unbelievable
<START> margaret colin stars as the principal figure in this story as i watched it i remembered her bit part in adrian as diane <UNK> neighbor in a tony ny neighborhood br br this movie was surprisingly good and diane <UNK> deserves credit for an accurate portrayal of class crimes and which actually occur in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the thought it is real but not over <UNK> the audience lives through her accident the pain it has caused denial and the ultimate resolution br br it is more than just a question of what is a good person as colin speaks to her husband is a person's character defined by one single act and should they be condemned forever because of their action the questions are <UNK> it is also amusing to see several cinematic references to martha stewart i e the <UNK> <UNK> mother colin is <UNK> by her sometime friends to be a perfect <UNK> with perfect <UNK> gag and a scene <UNK> colin is confronted by police the friends also <UNK> her later br br the denial and <UNK> of american society are addressed oh murder doesn't occur here similar to the theme in season in <UNK> by author dominick dunne about the true murder of martha in <UNK> <UNK> colin is aware of her crime but <UNK> finds herself <UNK> the <UNK> until she finally breaks down rent or buy this film she is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles
<START> the german <UNK> broadcast station has shown both the general and on saturday i've seen the general and i thought it wasn't very bad but not very good too but yesterday i've seen and i switched it off after about an hour although kevin spacey was the main actor the movie was totally confusing and seems restless the general told the story straight and ordered but just wanted to be cool there is a reference on the guy ritchie movies lock stock and two smoking <UNK> and snatch but doesn't have the <UNK> of these movies br br so in the end i would rate it 3 of 10
<START> given this film's incredible reviews i was expecting something truly exceptional it certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue and a fine cast in place a series of robert altman style <UNK> stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes i found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly it <UNK> like a pack of cards a series of ludicrous <UNK> and right on messages stack up until i'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about paul <UNK> has <UNK> the subject of race in la and that alone seems to have <UNK> this movie to a new level of interest given that most of the academy voters live in la and have experienced racism to some extent this film is sure to have an impact on them that means the oscar for best picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie let's hope it is the latter because <UNK> mountain is a <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece that deserves recognition
<START> why would this film be so good but only gross an <UNK> 95 000 000 and have no award nominations john travolta knows what he's doing he knows he's michael a <UNK> smoking <UNK> magical arch angel that came down to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of the national mirror and their dog <UNK> on the way to chicago it then turns into a road trip that's both horrible and great i don't even think the death scenes 3 to be exact make this a <UNK> the soundtrack is the best with heaven is my home up around the bend and chains of fools i have very great expectations about this and i say that it should have had a little more respect in the 90's read my comment bye
<START> i cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie i thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen it my have been b c i am mel brooks biggest fan i know almost all the words and get very <UNK> when they <UNK> them when it is played on a family channel this is one of my favorite movies so i dont know why any one would disagree thanks <UNK>
<START> i can barely even remember what decade i saw this film it was when i was a teenager i think i'm <UNK> now i started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s and so much of it has stayed with me ever since seeing other comments i had no idea it was shown at theatres or that anyone else even new it existed i don't think i've even mentioned the movie to anyone else br br but half a lifetime later i still remember much of the movie that i watched late at night so long ago i think the innocence of the their situation their mutual affection over a long period of time left a long term <UNK> for reasons i don't quite understand maybe it is because i was a teenager at the time i saw it and it touched me somehow i really don't know i also really wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened oh the agony br br i've not seen it before or since but i would love to i keep a casual look out for it but i now doubt it will been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion but i'd miss it in the tv guide even if it did show up br br reading the reviews here has <UNK> my interest if anyone knows of its <UNK> in australia by all means email me and let me know br br oh and sean bury nice to see you make an appearance on the comments here i've had a look at your movie history and noticed your last appearance in a james bond film what are you up to these day oh and do you have a copy of the film cheers
<START> i just thought i would add another observation here while there are a couple of visual sub references in this episode to the possibility of <UNK> feelings between jim kirk and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is a special physically tender moment toward the end when the enterprise is <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> speed in an attempt to <UNK> a possibly fatal <UNK> ball <UNK> perhaps <UNK> that their life is about to come to a dramatic end seeks comfort by placing her head on <UNK> sympathetic shoulder as they observe the <UNK> of their impending doom on the main viewer i thought it was sweet and <UNK> of course is gorgeous br br p s goof several times while supposedly firing the film shows <UNK> <UNK> being launched
<START> there no doubt in one <UNK> that this movie is stupid and unfunny joke but tell the truth it is quite entertaining if you re first time viewer and try not to <UNK> anything over all the movie have a very good ideas but badly written br br the story of the two losers waking up to find out that they can't remember what happen to them the day before only to find out later that they are after by the angry twin girl friends aliens <UNK> stripper aliens <UNK> and some gangs members br br isn't it like the bourne identity yeah yeah i know how can i compare the two movies but what the hell they both have no memories peoples were after them and so on br br anyway the movie is stupid and is only for the viewer that like stupid movie br br reason to watch <UNK> loads of young talented actors <UNK> very stupid after all you know it a stupid movie why not make it extreme br br reason not to <UNK> if you like to <UNK> then forget it <UNK> talented young actors turn bad <UNK> good <UNK> turn really bad br br rating 4 10 grade e br br br br <UNK> where's my <UNK> wait what do you expected from <UNK> movie i think almost every people got the same answer for this guy 'a really stupid <UNK> apart from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this guy really has nothing to offer his fan he should thank the series for his reputation <UNK> where's my <UNK> is one of his trademark somehow his film is even worst than adam <UNK> movies can you imagine that the movie is really non sense no story line and no nothing <UNK> jennifer garner alison <UNK> and s w should not have wasted their talent on this garbage they even came up with dude where's my <UNK> this shows how the movie companies are dying of making money rather than quality br br max 4 10 br br recommendation borrow it from your friends or just forget about it
<START> i saw this movie five times and never get tired of it this features <UNK> of the giallo genre but also with a vivid italian countryside setting where ignorance and <UNK> are <UNK> than any serial killer featuring excellent location reminiscent sometimes of fellini sometimes of the <UNK> brothers good characterisation and some of the finest genre actors including the great <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in an unforgettable role this is not euro trash just a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation it recently <UNK> great acclaim at the paris <UNK> at a double feature tribute to lucio fulci
<START> i've always been a fan of chuck norris for what he's accomplished and his movies for while i had been meaning to watch this film but for whatever reason didn't have chance apparently i didn't miss much this has to be one of <UNK> worst films so this <UNK> billy is given the chance to make his delivery but on the way he is and forced into a town where a foolish local corrupt judge <UNK> <UNK> who runs the whole town has him arrested and phony charges brought up on him he <UNK> the charges and makes a run for it the local <UNK> cops beat him and he disappears but now his brother <UNK> john norris another <UNK> goes looking for him he soon finds that the town is run buy the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found not long after he begins to beat off just about everyone in town in the meantime the female of the film calls on local <UNK> on a <UNK> radio and they all come <UNK> into town <UNK> it lol with there big <UNK> eventually norris finds his brother and beats off more thugs br br this movie was pretty bad it actually starts off ok and you feel great when norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt cops because there such losers but there is virtually no story the acting is bad and the ending  well it doesn't really have one the judge has his house <UNK> into by a big <UNK> and you never know what happens does he live norris never even gets to trash him in the meantime norris takes on some thug cop at the end who cares norris also manages to take on everyone in town gets his hand broken and shot in the side and goes on to keep fighting come on this movie was apparently made to cash in on the <UNK> <UNK> of the time why there was one is beyond me they <UNK> even use the in the movie adding to this the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet this movie is bad but if you're bored and need something to watch it will pass the time as far as norris he went on to make much better films than this 3 out of 10
<START> some spoilers included br br although many <UNK> have called this film surreal the term fits poorly here to quote from <UNK> surreal means br br fantastic or <UNK> imagery one <UNK> explain to the unimaginative how many ways a <UNK> ten year old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the <UNK> seat of a red <UNK> could be fantastic those curious might read james <UNK> but if you asked said <UNK> how he were <UNK> behind the wheel of a sports car he'd surely protest no way what fantasies and <UNK> the film offers mostly appear within the first fifteen minutes thereafter we get more <UNK> of the same in an ever <UNK> and more <UNK> progression that far from <UNK> soon proves predictable not that it were on the other hand literally believable but it were unfair to tax in particular with this flaw any plausible suspension of disbelief having fallen <UNK> on the typical film <UNK> and viewer's scale of values ever since <UNK> of the lost <UNK> became a blockbuster br br <UNK> how do we know what a <UNK> is if part of having one is not knowing that we are having one at any rate some people know that they enjoy <UNK> drugs but if <UNK> the result of doing so then i'm at a loss as to why anyone would take them more than once there is of course the occasional bad trip the movie must be one of those pun and all br br <UNK> of words that was startling how many times can a ten year old <UNK> you by <UNK> oh my god when he likes something or damn when he doesn't these two are about par for the course with this script sadly any sense of the surreal in what passes for dialogue could only reveal in direct <UNK> one's <UNK> regarding the speech <UNK> of the rising american generation br br a world completely defined and <UNK> depicted but that makes no rational sense world indeed makes no sense but it is about as completely defined as a cartoon in an <UNK> school newspaper the numerous guest stars in the cast all have cameo roles even less intelligent than our little hero who <UNK> damn in the blink of an but needs several seconds to <UNK> the <UNK> lie and even his character despite appearing in nearly every scene gets no significant development here's <UNK> reward for any viewer who <UNK> as i must enough to wish to know him better and understand <UNK> he's coming from ' one vaguely senses a far better story and protagonist struggling to get out br br fully recognizable realistically painted images are removed from their normal <UNK> and <UNK> within an ambiguous <UNK> or shocking <UNK> no we see a succession of stereotypical and ever more <UNK> <UNK> filling stations <UNK> <UNK> cheap <UNK> and their <UNK> along country <UNK> exactly where they <UNK> belong br br largely responsible for <UNK> the traditional emphasis on content there is little content moment to moment in br br to sum up picture british <UNK> dressed as <UNK> or pirates on the way to a posh costume party sitting <UNK> and mute as <UNK> <UNK> inch their rolls like fragile through a <UNK> sea of desperate humanity chinese who <UNK> them through the windows and <UNK> the glass with blood or imagine a stadium full of abandoned <UNK> <UNK> like those above now <UNK> and white <UNK> by ghosts into this <UNK> wander an exhausted boy and an <UNK> woman to whom he <UNK> as mother figure becoming girl friend who fall asleep side by side on the grass he is <UNK> on the feast of the white and day 1945 by a brilliant flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun finding that his <UNK> has become a corpse he first believes that he has witnessed her soul going up to heaven later he explains only a little less <UNK> 'i learned a new word today <UNK> bomb it's like god taking a photograph ' now there are just two <UNK> of cinematic <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> <UNK> out far enough to <UNK> its film's very title empire of the sun if you seek surreal please don't miss it alas however hard he <UNK> on the <UNK> to race his <UNK> through and beyond the desert no scenes so <UNK> strange rich subtle or gorgeous <UNK> poor little gus in his quest br br none of the above necessarily <UNK> a thumbs down on this film though somewhat disappointed i can't dismiss it in view of the <UNK> of another genre that it does <UNK> one influenced to be sure by <UNK> but also by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> amidst <UNK> power <UNK> let's try on for size theater of the absurd br br turning to e b 's article on this style i am amazed by how to the extent that theater of the absurd is a valid artistic style the above <UNK> to <UNK> like a <UNK> of smoke i'm tempted to quote the entire text as support of the <UNK> br br theater of the absurd attempts to show that the human situation is essentially absurd devoid of purpose <UNK> is left feeling hopeless <UNK> and anxious having <UNK> achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among <UNK> parents gus finds himself <UNK> until he drives past a <UNK> <UNK> reading and decides to win the <UNK> that it promises as others have already revealed this ambition proves <UNK> although the game never <UNK> the <UNK> corporation has no intention that anyone should ever win and has ways to trick confuse and leave <UNK> any <UNK> to the reward he like others is ultimately disappointed in his dream br br <UNK> <UNK> therefore did away with most of the logical structure of traditional theatre there is little dramatic action as <UNK> understood however <UNK> the characters perform their serves to <UNK> the fact that nothing happens to change their existence a timeless <UNK> quality emerges language in an <UNK> play is full of <UNK> repeating the obvious until it sounds like nonsense underneath a sometimes dazzling comic surface we find an underlying message of <UNK> distress obsession with a silly game his inane language the plot device <UNK> he a bleak future and or returns to an earlier moment and takes a different but still bleak turn so much fits now while an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films anyway of spielberg <UNK> of as it really is should find fellow <UNK> not instead but addition in the works of <UNK> <UNK> and br br but one can't quite stop here after his <UNK> with the game gus returns to phil i e love the first attendant he had met and the one person who had treated him <UNK> although he had also <UNK> him at a service station advertising be full filled under <UNK> <UNK> he learns a life of waiting for cars we might note here that the <UNK> playwright <UNK> had entitled his most famous play waiting for <UNK> and that for <UNK> we should read god god is one of <UNK> <UNK> too furthermore as the <UNK> result of his previous encounter with gus phil is badly <UNK> and goes about in a cast with his arms straight out in the last scene gus now <UNK> <UNK> says that he wants to hear music we hear none but we see phil <UNK> his fingers at the end of his <UNK> arm <UNK> gus closer and gus responds the end br br finally on to an author whom i happen to be reading currently the <UNK> <UNK> william <UNK> if this rebel lawyer is not acknowledged as an architect or of <UNK> <UNK> which is more a roman catholic than an <UNK> movement perhaps he should be police brutality and corporate greed are a cliche in cinema and literature including but <UNK> supports and <UNK> such sentiments with impressive <UNK> from <UNK> tradition and reason br br his most significant work is an expose of the <UNK> activities of those fallen angels whom the bible refers to as and powers wrote <UNK> are behind all of our popular three <UNK> images <UNK> and <UNK> all of these <UNK> themselves to our worship by making false promises the more deeply involved with an image an institution or an ideology any person becomes the more his own becomes <UNK> and be becomes a slave to them promising power control and <UNK> they <UNK> deliver <UNK> chaos and death as essentially fallen defeated powers they can do no more than that yet they humans with that <UNK> over the earth promised by god in the book of <UNK> while in fact no one of us controls an image an institution or an ideology bent inevitably on its own <UNK> and self <UNK> they take on lives of their own <UNK> happens to be a <UNK> a more accurate rendering of the <UNK> would be <UNK> but this is a <UNK> beside a more fundamental problem most of us neglect to notice that god had this power to adam before the fall we have no reason to assume that we his <UNK> still exercise it now on the contrary it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us br br one might add two observations of c s lewis first that man's conquest of nature is a mere illusion and a <UNK> to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as the <UNK> and secondly contrary to popular belief satan is no kind of good time charlie he may <UNK> out pleasures at first but he is very with them and will <UNK> them from any human firmly in his <UNK> perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and <UNK> with <UNK> br br now <UNK> these insights to we seem them <UNK> remarkably in experience he is if not nice at least a pretty little boy prior to falling victim to the game the first signs advertising it <UNK> <UNK> the longer he continues however and the deeper he <UNK> towards the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the more <UNK> they become he's lonely meeting no one else who plays the game the stations giving out the cards have either fallen into ruins or are <UNK> by zombies the people he does meet along the way are more and more ugly <UNK> and hostile the fact that the answer to a common dictator does not mean that they can <UNK> one another humanity is out of him as he becomes not only totally self centered and oblivious to the needs of others but partially <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aged while <UNK> in the literal sense of <UNK> challenged eventually even his precious <UNK> is taken from him in a crash and he must continue in a dead man's wreck yet at long last having done everything he thought was expected he presents himself to the <UNK> in its proud tower to receive his prize using the biblical power to confuse <UNK> by those who have built such <UNK> to their own vanity its agents <UNK> him disappoint insult and finally throw him from the top floor he falls long and hard landing finally in a body of water in other words in classic symbolism he dies he has met the inevitable bad end of anyone who has put his faith in such a <UNK> br br but this fate proves to be only a warning look into a <UNK> future he <UNK> and returns to phil and upon seeing him performs the very first generous <UNK> act we have seen from him for almost an hour and a half noting that phil is now handicapped and hardly able to insert a <UNK> into a gas tank he asks can i help you with that then seeing the help wanted sign he decides to apply for the job explaining to the <UNK> with whom he was <UNK> <UNK> that he <UNK> he'll get out here because it doesn't look like too bad a place to work br br this interpretation is <UNK> of course and it may surprise or even outrage the film's cult classic <UNK> who see quite different points in it br br if isn't quite my cup of tea i'm at least convinced now that it's hardly the worst film ever made
<START> this movie was jerry <UNK> idea to sell some records no seriously it was the thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a <UNK> sell it and make even more money for the studio you could also release a few tracks as <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> video with clips from the movie so that when mtv play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie this is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about hollywood movies from the 1980s and i rate the mid 1980s as the <UNK> time in artistic terms for american film making and <UNK> opened the door to this let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie type film making br br jennifer <UNK> plays alex <UNK> a dancer who works as a to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice <UNK> is a fairly sophisticated trade it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes there's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and being somehow similar ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot dirty the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job it's kind of like saying that screen writing novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not br br but i guess none of this <UNK> to jerry when he asked director adrian <UNK> to make the movie actually <UNK> almost makes a very sexy movie is very sweet and innocent looking fortunately i out why her face is <UNK> lit in close up while her <UNK> is darkly long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body that's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man i bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that
<START> this is an old dark house movie a young couple creep around a weird mansion said to be run by satan where they run from and into one after another of an ill <UNK> crew a lady in distress an ape an ape man a midget various odd looking people and for some reason two chinese they end up in a throne room where the hero is required to play a price is right sort of contest involving a climb up seven steps with seven <UNK> <UNK> hence the title for my taste it's too much of the same thing the <UNK> around fun house corridors is amusing for a while then becomes repetitive by comparison with harold lloyd or buster keaton or laurel and hardy doing the same bit in two <UNK> it isn't truly funny it's not frightening either and apparently wasn't intended to be the household is too absurd most films in this genre balance the comedy with a genuine threat and usually two one that the characters are led to believe is real and another for which it's a cover here the cover isn't to be taken seriously and neither is what covered a few moments of fun emerge from the mix but it's rather heavy fun the novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and i think could have been played straight to better effect and still could be
<START> the soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts you must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes you must know the story through various other reviews so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie br br firstly the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities the first being a woman who has <UNK> out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way the second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance you hate the former and your heart <UNK> for the latter br br the second thing about this movie is the entire concept of loving one for who one is <UNK> of gender so would you still love your partner if he she were to change his her sex the movie explores that idea and it is a beautiful one br br but there is one point where the movie fails i wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way that what they feel is love doesn't come across till the end but watch it and post your thoughts on it here
<START> mean spirited and down right <UNK> adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its <UNK> but lacks any talent what so ever mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor i have seen a lot of bad film this year but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made
<START> very reliable entertainment as las vegas <UNK> as well as <UNK> very light hearted and very much <UNK> by josh i like this television show and i think that many people watch it as a form of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in this case is very positive and many females in this series are very nice to look at this show <UNK> las vegas legends such as wayne <UNK> as <UNK> characters to the las vegas genre there have been <UNK> depictions of sin city this is one of the better efforts the producers and directors are lucky to have james <UNK> in the show as he is very much a totally accomplished actor by and large i like the t v show las vegas and i watch it on <UNK> i watched it on <UNK> as well but with monday night football i could see why nbc switched it to <UNK> nonetheless i like las vegas a lot
<START> for those of you looking for the crazy stunts that <UNK> a harold lloyd silent comedy this is not the film for you what the <UNK> <UNK> gives us is an interesting and <UNK> character for lloyd who was trying to establish himself in sound br br for me the closest movie comparison to <UNK> character is that of peter sellers in being there for all the education that lloyd has received in dealing with the world he might as well have been brought up in isolation as sellers was br br but where he was brought up was as a <UNK> child in china and i don't know how much christianity he and his family were able to teach the chinese but young harold has learned the wisdom of chinese <UNK> lin <UNK> whom he quotes constantly like a fortune cookie as it turns out lin <UNK> turns out to be one wise dude br br anyway <UNK> father samuel s <UNK> has decided his son needs some education in the modern world of 20th century america and he sends him back to be the guest of the <UNK> of the home church which <UNK> the mission the <UNK> there is the <UNK> candidate of the movement of that town of but no sooner does lloyd arrive and the <UNK> dies br br now the <UNK> movement is a <UNK> and the <UNK> a <UNK> of the political bosses who need a straw man <UNK> in every election they decide lloyd just might be a better <UNK> than the guy who just died br br of course as it goes in these type of films the <UNK> proves to be not so easy a <UNK> in fact lloyd constantly <UNK> from lin <UNK> the way charlie chan used to <UNK> wisdom proves quite the <UNK> for the crooks who run in addition lloyd <UNK> the admiration of <UNK> <UNK> as cynical a dame as jean arthur was in mr deeds and mr smith br br the <UNK> <UNK> is still a nice political satire though it did not establish harold lloyd as big a comedy name as he was in silent films a nice cast of players was selected by director sam taylor topped by george who plays a political boss who discovers lloyd and actually proves to have a streak of honesty in him
<START> this movie is very violent yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters it has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life the movie start off with action star leo <UNK> as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption black mail and murder this is where the killings start from start finish <UNK> delivers in this must see action caper this movie also co stars richard <UNK> br br i really enjoyed this film as a child but as i got older i realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good i would not recommend this film and the action is very very bad
<START> this is the last film of a trilogy by the brilliant turkish director <UNK> whose last film which was very was shown in <UNK> film festivals <UNK> from his previous films the story of is set on <UNK> which is one of the most crowded cities of the world however in film we do see only minor <UNK> of that huge crowd rather he choose to focus on two characters one photographer and one of his relatives who comes from his small village to find a job on <UNK> ships the photographer who we understand that has also to the city seems to be inhabited the customs of the city life not only in material sense in his relation to his relative we see him first as caring and <UNK> however when he could not find a job our character starts to be disturbed for sharing his private <UNK> with someone whose leaving date becomes ambiguous i will not reveal the tactics he develops in order to pull his relative out of his life to prevent any harm on your viewing pleasure but it is enough to say that shows us the tactics that we <UNK> within the routine of life to keep our own private space in order not to communicate with other people to prevent our relationships from gaining a complex nature since our own experience we believe that is complex enough br br film presents a clear picture of what a human being becomes within the borders of modern or <UNK> city by depicting the two characters in different manners but he doesn't <UNK> any of the two characters for doing this rather he uses the power of cinematic language to <UNK> this difference for example in search of new opportunities we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces even within the house he prefers balcony as his favourite space on the other hand we see the photographer always within the closed spaces and generally at his home although there are more than 10 million people out there and lots of adventures lots of interesting things to discover or are there any he prefers sitting at home watching tv etc his home is like his temple a kind of sacred place br br everyone living in a big city and conscious of the experience he is living through will find something <UNK> to himself in if you like this film i am sure that you will like other two films the clouds of may and the town go and find them
<START> i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill br br watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people i have br br been always looking forward to seagal movies and unfortunately i was first disappointed by <UNK> man which i found really bad the <UNK> is probably one of the worst seagal has ever br br acted in horribly boring badly edited soundtrack and so on dear reader do yourself a favor an stay away from this br br honestly stay away
<START> wow this is a touching story first i saw <UNK> i didn't <UNK> it and now i have seen the person <UNK> about whom this story is being told by <UNK> very <UNK> <UNK> is a driven human being who encountered the most opposite emotions in his live on this earth what an extraordinary life this person has led his tale about the capture by the <UNK> <UNK> and thus his suffering is horrifying but what's most impressive is his incredible will to survive how could he find the <UNK> in a haunting way <UNK> is telling us in full flowing sentences about his terrible ordeal during his <UNK> he is a great <UNK> and <UNK> does him the justice this brave man deserves br br in my opinion <UNK> <UNK> needs to fly ' tells it all leaving nothing to the imagination thus making ' rescue dawn ' a superfluous film the horror doesn't get more real than in the words of <UNK> himself he totally succeeds in painting the picture
<START> its really been a long time since the last time somebody created a movie such as like this on a so called b movie maybe it was not a great movie but it is fun to watch classic bruce <UNK> it has its good parts funny ones disgusting ones even artistic ones br br spoiler ahead br br br br the part where his wife as a <UNK> robot <UNK> is about to die i don't know about you but it made me feel so weird so sad and disgusted in a good way i compare this scene with the scene form the fly 2 where his dog as a monster dies makes you think oh my god br br br br no more spoilers br br if you are a bruce <UNK> fan you definitely wanna have this movie in your collection if you are generally interested in movies you might wanna just think that the movies target is to make you smile gross you out don't worry not that bad though and make you have a good time with your buddies attention i said buddies not possible future girlfriend
<START> hoot is a nice young person's film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a <UNK> house chain from a plot of land that is home to some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost <UNK> it is a film for the young crowd perhaps 5 to 11 years of age i thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that the screen these days there is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids it's just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed if you can remember back to the day when you weren't fight for a buck you may remember that money isn't everything not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series
<START> i used to work in a video store i saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one night br br this movie was truly awful there is no redeeming quality about it because it actually takes a well respected sub genre of film and just goes about destroying it if the first film wasn't low budget enough then this film truly takes the <UNK> being <UNK> mostly <UNK> and at night therefore avoiding the <UNK> cost setting of the first film in the first 5 minutes of this film a college <UNK> <UNK> runs over an attractive student rather than be <UNK> the <UNK> half <UNK> <UNK> and the girl mentions that despite being thrown across the cars <UNK> he <UNK> up as he approached her that there is nothing to worry about after which he attacks her with a <UNK> and kills her if this isn't strange enough he wants to perform an experiment upon her bringing her back from the dead and so feels the need to remove her clothing to do so br br soft core female nudity and <UNK> hair is rampant throughout the film and is to be honest the only real thing to hold the average male viewers interest like the swimming scene in the first film but even having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting crappy dialogue and absurd plot turns why introduce a pivotal character who has survived <UNK> days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutes its just a very very bad film
<START> scarier than any horror movie ever made because you're in controlled of this blood fest which make it more scarier than watching other people doing it on the big screen or on your television screen this game got two <UNK> which make the game much more entertaining br br each cd contains a different character with a complete different story line which make the game much more fun i recommend you to buy this game and the first game too isn't as good as this game still fun though br br br br
<START> a savage <UNK> lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival he suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it at first he thinks bugs <UNK> home is belong to a <UNK> yet when he wakes bugs up from his sleep <UNK> him up to the ground there he meets with bugs his next <UNK> br br if you ever wonder how bugs would turn a savage lion into a <UNK> <UNK> dancer with traditional <UNK> on you should watch this cartoon director bob offers endless <UNK> by means of absurd and unexpected <UNK> humour br br the signature scenes include br br 1 the look of bugs <UNK> home cross <UNK> to donald duck with the b b name <UNK> on the <UNK> of bed br br 2 bugs <UNK> short journey with the mine <UNK> climbing up to the ground floor br br 3 when <UNK> the lion calls his friend the elephant for help bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the elephant since the elephant needed a <UNK> to that toy mouse he uses <UNK> as a <UNK> br br 4 bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make up and the practical clown jokes that he makes br br 5 the <UNK> scene while <UNK> chasing after bugs br br 6 the famous human <UNK> scene after which <UNK> the lion starts dancing <UNK> <UNK> br br the magic moments which keep bunny fresh at all times in our memory br br 1 when bugs comes out of his bunny hole he thinks he's in the <UNK> tale and starts acting to save <UNK> out of the giant <UNK> stomach br br 2 when the lion <UNK> to scare him bugs replies back to him with roaring br br 3 bugs arguing with the lion for he's making so much noise then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him br br 4 wearing rubber heels at the circus bugs starts to <UNK> like toy <UNK> and causes <UNK> to <UNK> br br those are the 10 main reasons that keeps bunny as a bugs bunny classic and can be found in the bugs bunny mgm <UNK> video 1989
<START> to <UNK> this movie nice for tv but too small for the theatre i enjoyed watching this movie at home but i wont watch it a second time the concept is good but what ends up in the movie is just a summary the end had a <UNK> twist but is still unsatisfying maybe it was the intention of the director but it wasn't worked out like a it should be but then again it's an ok kind of movie
<START> is an animated series about a girl named <UNK> jones voiced by pamela anderson who lives a double life as a stripper at a <UNK> club known as the tender <UNK> and as a sexy crime fighter known as a k a agent <UNK> who works for a government organization as <UNK> fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast <UNK> that either explode or make them fat and <UNK> a criminal who steals from 99 <UNK> stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun the creator of the character and the series is stan lee of marvel fame and creator of spider man br br back in late june of 2003 spike tv then known as the new <UNK> premiered a <UNK> night block of three animated shows those shows were <UNK> <UNK> adult party cartoon new adventures of classic kids show characters <UNK> and <UNK> for adults done by original creator john gary the rat about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring <UNK> of cheers and <UNK> fame and the adventures of a stripper who <UNK> as a superhero voiced by pamela anderson and created by stan lee i remember seeing all three of the <UNK> i was anxious to see <UNK> and <UNK> as i love the original show i was a little let down it was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much though gary the rat wasn't bad the best of the three was easily the animation was really good it had an awesome intro song it had some good talent behind it and it was funny as hell the show was just so silly i don't even know how to begin explaining it after four of five weeks if not a little less the animation block disappeared which was weird because i know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere i was disappointed to see go but several months later i found out about new episodes that aired at like 1 00 am i only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and i was glad to see the show back after all that time something seemed a bit off br br in the beginning of it's short run had great animation it was dark moody realistic and somewhat sexy too the <UNK> looked good too the character was drawn well after the long <UNK> and during the rest of the episodes the animation was very different instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish received the biggest changes though before she had normal long hair now she had hair bigger than peggy married with children if even possible also the eye mask actually shows her eyes now before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more also the upper part of her costume was kind of a <UNK> type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue that changed to her costume being a <UNK> <UNK> color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison in short the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand but the second half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh out loud hilarious it became more zany as well for example there was a later episode about a were <UNK> yes a were <UNK> br br anyway instead of complaining about the mid series changes only ran one season but it was a very good show like the tales from the crypt film <UNK> of blood it may be really campy but it's really fun as long as your not a <UNK> you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show i haven't seen every episode because i haven't got the dvd yet for two reasons 1 paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released tv shows even though this was the entire show i would have liked to see some <UNK> explaining the animation change and interviews with pamela anderson and stan lee and 2 the awesome kid rock song during the opening was replaced now i'm not a fan of his but that intro sang was the theme for the show if your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack <UNK> the show also had a few interesting guest stars such as john <UNK> as <UNK> and mark <UNK> as the plastic who hates models also tom kenny <UNK> was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode stan lee has a cameo in one episode too br br the breakdown br br pros had a great look to it at first funny as hell a very fun show great voice talent for the most part chief watch the show and see some of the stuff he does and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier br br cons the mid series animation change and the crappy dvd described earlier aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times i have nothing really negative to say about this br br overall is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season it was a very funny sexy <UNK> packed cult series that i hope to see air on adult swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like family guy check it out even if it is on the lousy dvd you will laugh yourself silly br br rated tv ma crude and sexual humor and nudity runtime about 25 minutes per episode score 9 10
<START> i've just been at the cinema in down town <UNK> watching this film br br not due to the poster i found very old fashioned heroic br br style not due to the high level starring which remind me that most br br of those high starring french films are usually pathetic but just br br because there are not so many films in my french mother tongue in a br br city like <UNK> and because i love <UNK> depardieu and br br <UNK> then i decided to write up this small comment because i think br br i really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdb br br i was not disappointed the film just look like the poster the br br characters are just as stupid as they look like for a while i br br thought <UNK> would be like a caricature just a funny character br br you can laugh at no she is not for example when she decides to tell br br depardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at the br br beginning of the film then come the <UNK> in a big fat pathetic br br music which should make you cry and realize character is a br br deeper person as she looks like maybe this was humor at the <UNK> br br level but i am sorry my sense of humor is not that high if i want to br br see some funny french film on the wwii i watch once again la <UNK> br br it is <UNK> more fun i have also read on imdb br br that <UNK> is making a great performance in this film i have to br br say i have never seen a so bad acting well i have never seen any ed br br <UNK> film nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good br br very <UNK> scenes like the one with the <UNK> in the morning br br when the german army arrives at paris or when the <UNK> settle down br br on a bridge in <UNK> i think is a good filmmaker but br br that he does better with a good script it was easy with <UNK> he br br had not to write the dialogs br br i give 1 10
<START> this film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at <UNK> in the big california theatre in san jose it's a musical which normally i don't like but i have to say this one was different robert peters who directed the film and <UNK> in it did such a wonderful job during his q a he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew most of the <UNK> was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in germany i can't say enough great things about this movie the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the camera work and it shakes a bit if you happen to come across this film check it out
<START> not being a fan of the <UNK> brothers or george clooney anyone can see the <UNK> i took into the theater once again someone in hollywood <UNK> to create something different this time it was those for a temporary lack of a better word doing their thing to one of the great works in literary history who would've ever thought homer had this in mind i don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of hollywood but it will be in both mine and many others dvd or vhs library it is one of those films that you can watch over and over the story is brilliantly written clean and entertaining with a couple of <UNK> with fame great performances by clooney <UNK> nelson and a brief but hilarious holly hunter being born in <UNK> and raised in other parts of the south i wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this they even <UNK> a soundtrack fitting for the rural south you are not doing anything better this weekend go see this movie br br
<START> <UNK> island filmmaker andy <UNK> is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than ed wood and with this as a dim example of his <UNK> i'm apt to agree with them in the ghastly ones we basically have three <UNK> couples traveling to their childhood home located on a conveniently secluded island to collect an inheritance there they are killed off one by one and the events unfold in murder mystery fashion with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> butler added to throw you for a loop the film is in such bad shape that it looks like someone just ran it through a <UNK> the sound is terrible the dialog is <UNK> bad there's some primitive <UNK> gore plus some <UNK> and guts and it's technically inept in every possible way it can be inept but is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way sort of it's excruciating to watch but oddly entertaining in a train wreck fashion approach with caution if you're not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one
<START> shameless screen entertainment is a relatively new and british i think dvd label <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> violent cult movies  mostly italian ones from the glorious <UNK> when everything was possible namely from the late 60's up until the mid 80's the selection feels like a <UNK> between the <UNK> of <UNK> and no shame they probably even borrowed the name of the latter and they already released some really rare sick italian <UNK> like <UNK> my dear killer killer nun phantom of death and <UNK> the frightened woman was completely unknown to me but since fellow reviewers from around here whose opinions i hugely value described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro <UNK> movies of its era i didn't hesitate to pick it up this is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99 of the average cinema loving audiences if you're part of that remaining 1 however you're in for a really unique treat the style atmosphere and content are similar to jess <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> yet they're both widely considered as classics whereas the frightened woman is virtually unknown it's all a matter of <UNK> and good marketing i guess the story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion owns multiple old <UNK> cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy <UNK> including a life size <UNK> doll <UNK> of himself with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women he considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping <UNK> and sexually <UNK> random he picks up from the street dr <UNK> then <UNK> the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit but he slowly falls for her just he starts to believe in actual love she strikes back with a vengeance this really isn't for everyone but if you can appreciate moody sexy bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal you can consider this one a top recommendation it's slow <UNK> sleazy and totally shameless entertainment all right
<START> the polar express director robert <UNK> i love back to the future forrest <UNK> contact and who framed roger rabbit no question mark after that movie title and tom hanks one of my favorite actors the reviews of this movie were almost <UNK> saying that this is an instant holiday classic ebert <UNK> give it two enthusiastic thumbs up even <UNK> written review gave it a full four stars wow ok this i gotta see but wait the motion capture used looks really weird hmm maybe i'm not so interested in seeing this anymore br br well you says the train conductor to the boy in the polar express the boy is reluctant at first and the train begins on its course without him the boy soon changes his mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time br br now most of you have probably decided to not jump aboard this train and wait for the tv train or rental express <UNK> <UNK> i'm so witty and clever i on the other hand was like the boy who was skeptical at first but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about br br i just wasted 10 and two hours of my life br br i can't even begin to explain the pain in my stomach the polar express was so painful to sit through it's not even funny there's no story there's no pay off you sit there through these series of events and you wonder is there any point to all this it'd be one thing if the scenes were entertaining but they're not br br this movie is void of any emotion any soul any ounce of <UNK> and most of all any fun this movie is not fun br br and let's talk about the way these characters look for a second saying that it's the same technology motion i'm sorry performance capture used to make <UNK> is a real shame because <UNK> was believable photo realism just does not translate well in this medium you're using animation why not design the characters to be more <UNK> or why not just film it all with real actors they certainly could have we as people know all too well how we walk talk interact with things seeing it on the screen done <UNK> is not impressive caricatures done convincingly is all the more believable as the <UNK> has proved the result of the polar express now is as if they took corpses of dead children and turned them into puppets they're moving and talking but where's the heart where's the soul that's what we're seeing on the screen ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh this movie is so horrible br br there's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it he wants to give it to her but you sit there going why just leave it she's coming back he of course loses the ticket and adventure ensues and then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time and they bring him hot chocolate but he can't come up and join the rest of the kids and then there's this annoying know it all kid with the voice of a 35 year old it's all so very disturbing br br oh and there's songs one girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is he's singing a song to himself and then she <UNK> and joins in they end the song as they're holding hands looking into each others eyes as if they were lovers very awkward i won't even go into details about the song about serving hot chocolate while <UNK> dance around the train keep it hot keep it hot the one scene where tom hanks <UNK> on his knees with his arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most <UNK> bad scenes in the history of bad scenes br br i have to stop now or i'll just kill myself i need to watch something crappy to <UNK> the palette yes crappy is better than the polar express br br the one thing about trains it doesn't matter where you're going what matters is deciding to get on br br don't get on this one for the love of god i have decided for you this is just another film taken from a children's book stretched incredibly thin into movie form it happened with the grinch and the cat in the hat and those were horrible also but who can blame them i bet if i took the book the <UNK> too much junk food and turned that into a feature film it'd probably be pretty dull also but at least <UNK> be a story and a point which is what the polar express is so lacking of
<START> had she not been married to the producer jennifer jones would not have been the most obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic tale of an affair between an american soldier and an english nurse set against the backdrop of the first world war her british accent is not perfect and in the fifties it was unusual for a big romantic lead to go to an actress in her late thirties even one as attractive as miss jones especially when she was several years older than her leading man there were a number of beautiful young british actresses in hollywood around this time such as audrey hepburn elizabeth taylor jean simmons and joan collins any of whom might have been more convincing in the role but miss jones had one important <UNK> they all lacked namely a marriage <UNK> with david o <UNK> name on it in the event the film turned out to be such a turkey that they were <UNK> grateful not to have it on their <UNK> br br the film tells at great length the story of the romance between <UNK> an american <UNK> serving with the italian army as an <UNK> driver and catherine a nurse with the british red cross after the italian defeat at the battle of <UNK> is wrongly accused of being a german spy and sentenced to death the film paints a very harsh picture of italian military justice it would appear that italian <UNK> martial had the power to pass the death sentence after a trial lasting all of thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without allowing the <UNK> to be <UNK> represented or to speak in his <UNK> <UNK> manages to escape and to cross the border into neutral switzerland accompanied by the pregnant catherine br br <UNK> novels have not always been a great success when filmed howard <UNK> succeeded in making a good version of to have and have not a film that is considerably better than the book on which it is <UNK> based but that is because he largely ignored <UNK> plot and turned the film into a remake of casablanca set in rather than french <UNK> like the 1943 version of for whom the bell <UNK> a farewell to arms is overlong and <UNK> slow moving it is also miscast jennifer jones never makes catherine come to life as for rock hudson his assumed christian name could be unfortunately appropriate he could be as solid as a rock but also as <UNK> as one and in this film his <UNK> seems an <UNK> of the great stone face despite the passion and emotion inherent in <UNK> plot the emotional <UNK> is always far too cool the picture has little going for it apart from some attractive picture <UNK> views of italian and swiss scenery it is hardly surprising that it was not a success and that its failure ended <UNK> career as a producer 4 10 br br a goof shortly before the battle of an italian officer states that russia had already <UNK> a separate peace with germany that battle started in october <UNK> at a time when russia was still fighting alongside the allies the russian revolution did not take place until november it was only the october revolution by the old julian <UNK> the new <UNK> regime signed an <UNK> with germany in december <UNK> but a separate peace was not signed until the <UNK> of in march <UNK>
<START> <UNK> another bad film by larry <UNK> that guy did not learn to stop did he first he gives us zero budget sci fi movies and lies about famous dead people and now he is <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> monster as being vicious br br the plot is basically about some <UNK> of the usa pretending to be scottish camping out at <UNK> <UNK> alas out on the fishing hole <UNK> i mean lake of <UNK> <UNK> there is a killer monster that <UNK> itself to be going out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason br br i am surprised that the crew of mst3k never heard of this movie yes it is that bad too
<START> do the writers that <UNK> up these type of comedies have such empty lives that they have to <UNK> them in tragic shows like this br br why the talented and gorgeous busy phillips is amongst this trash is beyond me i cannot stand the hispanic girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so unfunny and annoying as is the other african american girl with the shrill voice br br the jokes are often stupid the jewish guy yells a lot and the show never goes anywhere one particular episode with the <UNK> looking for love was just terrible br br i don't believe there would be that many working in a looking for love office and only one man of course all of the woman are in tight fitting tops and tons of make up to make up for their lack of talent br br i actually found holly funny in her older shows and i have always admired busy but this show is dumb empty and had nothing going for it
<START> the very first time i saw this i in horror at what was being presented as modern <UNK> women br br sorry but i cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives <UNK> around <UNK> sex and the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and louis <UNK> the <UNK> thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in nyc it's definitely not these women are incredibly shallow and <UNK> and as another reviewer said they act like gold digging br br this is not <UNK> <UNK> and i'm glad it's gone 0 stars and just plain awful
<START> yes i admire the independent spirit of it all but it's like road trip with a bad cast and no budget br br i chuckle when i watch american comedies i don't laugh this movie made me laugh but only because of the <UNK> obvious attempts to <UNK> high budget american high school pot flicks br br if you want good independent american comedy with pot references go watch kevin smith or richard <UNK> flicks or something don't waste your time on this piece of movie br br i mean how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot br br and by the way in <UNK> it's called dude where's my pot
<START> the movie is an adaptation of a japanese story by the respected author <UNK> <UNK> it simply doesn't make the transition into a credible story about brits and americans br br the story moves <UNK> especially the part where miles and kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a <UNK> cutting through the waves and the little route line filling in on the <UNK> while their letters are heard in the film moves so <UNK> that i even fast <UNK> through the sex and masturbation scenes which although long are not really either passionate or erotic the film did achieve a measure of <UNK> when <UNK> then wife divorced him for extra <UNK> activities with miss miles during the filming i guess they enjoyed the sex scenes but it isn't quite the same for a viewer br br there are no characters to hang on to the sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable the little kid is <UNK> kristofferson is <UNK> enough but he just doesn't have the acting skills to bring much to the role although perhaps we don't really want get too involved with him considering his ultimate fate br br as for the little kid well he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his <UNK> life now this is a really bad crowd they don't just and smoke <UNK> they slip a mickey to a cat and it this is shown in gory detail but of course this is only practice so they can do the same thing to kristofferson br br so the movie mostly moves slowly with no characters to relate to and when something does happen it is <UNK> morbid br br the ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you'll ever see br br this all might have made some sense if the japanese locale and cultural context had been <UNK> as it stands it is just abysmal br br
<START> hey i didn't order no cab yeah well you got one what can i say about hack what a man among men he was a <UNK> ex cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold if you were able to and fortunately for america's tv viewers one person per week was <UNK> the cold hard surface of exterior you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice the show was superb i laughed i cried i <UNK> all in the same episode my arms would break out in <UNK> when our dear friend hack would exit his cab in another dark alley with nothing more than his <UNK> ready to avenge a <UNK> <UNK> a smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark <UNK> facial expressions when the taxi of <UNK> <UNK> upon his face week after week i canceled my duties as president of the <UNK> association to in the warmth glow of brilliance i have never seen a better show and i <UNK> the loss of one of america's greatest <UNK> when the show was canceled in other hack related news i would like to <UNK> to the world that my wife and i are expecting hack <UNK> to come into the world in about three weeks
<START> the movie razor blade smile has an interesting title as well as leading role now most may not like this movie for the plot and acting was a little cheap but that is the appeal of a movie like razor blade smile in a way it was suppose to be bad movie br br however if you watch this movie all the way through the end you'll see it is as i said a cheap vampire flick with a little humor also how they manipulated colours in a few scenes is very interesting br br so in conclusion this movie is a type you rent and laugh at with your friends and enjoy it for what it is for no movie is <UNK> bad br br as <UNK> silver says humans just don't smile enough
<START> ben <UNK> an ex green <UNK> stops off at a little town called to visit an old friend <UNK> <UNK> soon after riding into town on his <UNK> and <UNK> in a motorcycle gang known as 'the who's led by <UNK> <UNK> and finally take over the place <UNK> doesn't want to get involved but that changes when he friends become the actual targets br br is there anything good to say about this <UNK> item tough call as the only fundamental reason to watch this low budget car wreck is for the tremendous b cast the crew managed to get hold off for this project while i don't think it's a complete <UNK> job it's not terribly good either now what a cast lance <UNK> being the main character he strangely doesn't have top billing but the final one karen black george kennedy richard lynch bill forsythe mickey jones and leo gordon now what went wrong with this <UNK> low budget <UNK> the <UNK> of the material is too one dimensional that it heavily borrows ideas from better movies namely mad max and comes up with a complete mess of ideas that just don't <UNK> and could have been better thought out the clichés that are used can be manipulated into a good viewing despite being predictable but savage dawn seems to let it rush all by without letting the viewer <UNK> it all up the cast are mostly wasted in nothing roles a <UNK> blonde <UNK> is <UNK> solid and even with his <UNK> presence that provides an enigmatic glow to his character he doesn't get up to hell of a lot and sometimes goes missing in action too much <UNK> action but when he did kick some ass the good times <UNK> karen <UNK> <UNK> performance is a very odd one and is all about the screaming and <UNK> although she does get into one memorable <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character katie a wheelchair bound george kennedy <UNK> around <UNK> until the final assault and richard lynch looks embarrassed as a <UNK> priest town mayor in a very redundant role an on edge bill forsythe simply <UNK> it up as the head <UNK> of the notorious biker pack br br the <UNK> story written by william <UNK> and max bloom has that cheesy comic book and very much is influenced by the western genre just look at the villains for that how they came up with their names is mystery maybe they drew them out of a hat it's pretty second rate material that more often moves onto one <UNK> scene after another unfunny comical elements are <UNK> in and as well a bit of sleaze tacky exploitation that doesn't get gritty enough and the deaths are quite laughable a clumsy script is filled convoluted details and unbearable trite simon <UNK> direction was by the numbers and <UNK> laid out one or two intense scenes can't makeup for its <UNK> like pacing and many <UNK> handed stunts the cardboard sets had down <UNK> dirty look but lack that <UNK> sense the <UNK> like cinematography by <UNK> was better handled when the main focus wasn't on the town but on the desolate backdrop like the beginning and ending climax of the film with some neat camera touches <UNK> clunky music choices are drowned out by its own incompetence br br savage dawn is a forgettable <UNK> midnight movie that's a definite misfire for most part there are better and more convincing <UNK> of the same <UNK> out there
<START> leonard <UNK> directed star trek iii which wasn't half bad maybe william shatner thought seeming as how <UNK> did it he could after seeing this film he should have <UNK> that decision br br star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and <UNK> is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain br br the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it <UNK> bear thinking about which basically involves a <UNK> stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention <UNK> does a belly dance to distract male guards she looked like she was taking part in a <UNK> competition if they meant to make her look sexy they were wrong she looked grotesque br br how this got to production or even written well it <UNK> bear thinking about the only place good for this film is in the garbage the worst one of the series
<START> imagine a film the complete opposite of lawrence of <UNK> instead of having an all male cast it has an all female cast instead of being set in the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> it is set in the <UNK> metropolis of new york city and instead of it being one of the greatest films ever made it is one of the most pointless boring and forgettable br br the film concerns mary haines meg ryan a perfect wife and mother the envy of all others in her high society <UNK> social circle she is painted as a women bearing the weight of the world on her shoulders despite the fact she needs a live in <UNK> and <UNK> to cope with her one child but i don't want to be too hard on her mary does all this whilst taking a <UNK> attitude towards the fashion <UNK> job her father has given her this <UNK> lifestyle cannot last forever though and things start to crash in a very real way br br <UNK> husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough she is quite naturally upset and breaks down a little br br mary needs to <UNK> back though for the sake of her <UNK> young daughter and for herself she does this through <UNK> hair <UNK> and <UNK> her own line of clothes though amazingly for this kind of film not a montage mary succeeds her daughter loves her her mother loves her her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now she decides to take her cheating husband back after <UNK> it was her fault he cheated as she didn't <UNK> on him enough br br the films one saving grace is that it doesn't go down the all men are evil route
<START> <UNK> on the success of the 1975 hit this film is a cheaply made story of a plantation where gets down with the slave women and the <UNK> gets down with the big black stud and with son also in fact there is so much getting down going on that i really don't know why anyone bothered to get dressed br br so if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes then this one is for you br br there is a funny sad story in here but it only comes at the very end so as to not <UNK> with all the hot <UNK> sex going on on the plantation
<START> i'm new to <UNK> but i would have started much sooner if this film had been around i caught it at gen con last year a trip made only as a favor to my husband and loved it even to a non <UNK> like i was at the time it's funny and accessible so much so that i finally <UNK> and started sitting in on my husband's <UNK> group br br i don't want to give away any plot details but if you're a <UNK> you need to see this film and if you're not you're going to have a great time despite yourself there are certainly in jokes but the vast majority of the film is accessible to anyone br br my only complaints wish it were longer and wish it were available on dvd soon perhaps
<START> a sadly predictable clichéd story about a woman who was no better than she should have been sadly too the screenplay is by the once great experimental novelist john <UNK> from an original by french exotic <UNK> pierre this time marlene <UNK> is <UNK> a manipulative cold hearted spanish beauty don <UNK> lionel <UNK> raises her from the cigarette factory but she <UNK> him he warns his tall young friend antonio <UNK> romero against her but to no <UNK> a duel ensues <UNK> <UNK> for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for so he doesn't he points his pistol at the sky but antonio shoots him but instead of going off to paris with the young victor she goes back to the man who would have died for her with an unexpected bit by edward everett <UNK> as a spanish <UNK> <UNK> plays the part of a spanish woman by moving constantly <UNK> at the <UNK> and <UNK> and then <UNK> back <UNK> her head and so forth and she makes faces and has a <UNK> in the middle of her <UNK> the photography is strangely crowded no <UNK> scene can be shot except through a <UNK> of bare trees no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room no <UNK> scene of <UNK> can be shot without a major wardrobe change the carnival scenes are so full of <UNK> and <UNK> it's almost like an underwater scene in the <UNK> sea
<START> this is primarily about love in wwii yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life br br the movie's timing is just great it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed while it may prove boring to some the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it br br at one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors cillian murphy is on fine form here as is matthew rhys both are polar <UNK> and it makes for an interesting watch the relationship formed between <UNK> miller and <UNK> <UNK> characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank and watch out for a cameo by of <UNK> br br despite all of this it's a rather slow movie coupled with the fact it's just shy of two hours it's quite a <UNK> to get to the conclusion br br overall it's a solid non fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well known british names behind the scenes but it really does <UNK> on for too much at times still a worthwhile watch 7 10
<START> the original review i had planned for this movie was perhaps a little over harsh so i'll <UNK> with the good sleepy hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer and pizza or <UNK> movie the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no one's really focusing on the movie the visual elements are beautiful and it is kinda fun in parts but horror my friends it is not i made the mistake of watching it expecting something to <UNK> at with all the lights off if this is your intention send me a personal message and i'll offer you a list of alternate <UNK> that's a serious offer by the way true horror fans deserve better now my complaints complete with spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers why bother even making a movie based on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense feel tone or theme of the original listen carefully between the lines of ill written dialogue and you'll hear the slow <UNK> of washington irving rolling over in his grave i will even accept the big city detective bit but <UNK> drawing around the bed come now not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in the legend of sleepy hollow but it's historical <UNK> i don't care what neo <UNK> axe you have to <UNK> but in the 18th century witchcraft meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for diabolical powers this whole <UNK> white witch <UNK> worship <UNK> it harm none approach to witchcraft dates back historically about as far as the british invasion parties interested in real old school <UNK> practices are referred to james the golden <UNK> if you don't believe me this creates such a <UNK> element thrown into the context of the film that the very <UNK> of the sleepy hollow legend is <UNK> so we wind up with a totally different story altogether if that was <UNK> idea i wish he'd warned us in advance also i wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here and he might as well have dropped the irving <UNK> altogether and at any rate the movie isn't scary not once not at all the <UNK> tree came close but was more than <UNK> by the laughable effect of the farce comedy <UNK> and finally yes i too wanted christina <UNK> for christmas but god clearly never meant her to be a blonde
<START> great chris has got to be the best williams that i have every seen he acts it up perfectly this was like watching williams as he really was and is it almost made me cry watching him br br i had no idea that robin was as close a friend to john belushi as he was the portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits very sad what both of them went through br br i really felt for both val and robin during his rough times i am glad that they ended it in a high note br br i hope robin puts a 100 bill in this guy's hat br br and it was great that it was filmed in <UNK>
<START> this is possibly one of my favorite films it tells the tale of a girl named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who lost her mother at a very young age so has been bought up by her father she falls in love with the bell boy named <UNK> however on her birthday the snow queen bridget fonda comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps <UNK> then goes after <UNK> and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him br br i thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast it has wonderful special effects and the story fits together very well and is easy to follow i think that it is a great film for all the family to enjoy i have watched it every time t has been on since it came out and have never tired of it which is why i have given it a 10
<START> opera the u s title is terror at the opera is somewhat of a letdown after some of other movies like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i still can't find <UNK> anywhere it's one of those movies that has a great first half but <UNK> through it's like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logic br br the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion he <UNK> and gags her and tape tiny sharp <UNK> under her <UNK> so if she tries to close her eyes she'll <UNK> out her eyes this forces her to watch while the killer murders her <UNK> in typically brutal and gory <UNK> fashion br br unfortunately about <UNK> through the film becomes <UNK> and illogical this is especially directed towards the killer's motivations i still haven't completely figured out why he's such a nut the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sense br br but for about the first hour or so this is some of best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking too bad it couldn't maintain it through to the end br br rating 7
<START> historical drama is one of the areas where the british just can't be beat so while i'm not a huge fan of the genre i can usually be <UNK> to watch something <UNK> this if it's british and with decent actors br br i have never read anything by sarah waters which is of course something i should do hence i didn't really know what to expect from this i had heard that there would be a lesbian love story but not much more while watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well crafted although there were almost a twist too many somewhere it took me a minute to get everything straight br br production values are good the actors are very solid and the pace is decent although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half hour that might just be me though i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished all in all though this is a fairly enjoyable three hours i recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas
<START> this movie has one of the best club scenes very good soundtrack if you like <UNK> <UNK> music br br some situations as the main character carl begins to take drugs for example are a little off reality but the plot is entertaining but the characters are all a little shallow br br i'd not recommend you to see this film if you don't like <UNK> music br br for the plot acting alone this movie is a 4 10 with the really cool special effects and the club scenes and soundtrack it's a 7 10 but if you would want to go to the movies just to hear nice tracks and grab a little club feeling it's a 10 10 br br the special effects are sometimes hidden sometimes clearly visible i e fast moving clouds sun moon <UNK> background <UNK> cuts br br i for one enjoyed it very much a shame there was no in the cinema
<START> this is a very very boring and uninteresting action film and without chuck norris it would have been unbearable plus the low budget shows big time some of the fights were good but the story is laughable and there no menacing villains at all the dialog was laughable i had some trouble finishing this film but chuck norris made it somewhat bearable i really have nothing more to say since i was only paying half attention because it was so incredibly boring however it did pick up a tiny bit towards the end the direction is terrible don does a terrible job here with lousy photography an awful pace and overall the film looked dull there is no gore the acting was terrible chuck norris is very good here he kicks that ass and he made the film almost bearable chuck rules george <UNK> is terrible as the main villain and very unconvincing terry <UNK> is decent here and had okay chemistry with chuck michael is decent as <UNK> brother overall it's quite simple avoid out of 5 chuck saves it from the bomb rating
<START> the film that gave us john waters is one of the funniest films ever yes it may be gross but it's filled with hysterical moments that nobody has done since the infamous dog scene has to be one of the highlights of cinema not a film for the easily offended it's one of those movies where you always see something new performance is worth the reputation <UNK> stole is hysterical this is the film responsible for the <UNK> brothers and the entire gross out comedy genre i know that sounds a bit extreme but think about it before this comedies were very run of the mill and almost identical after this movie comedies became strange and weird but in a good way i'd give it 15 out of 10 if i could
<START> i would not recommend this movie even though it is rated g and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing including the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> words this kind of language doesn't offend me particularly but in a kids film come on br br there was also quite a bit of implied sexual content between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along including a prostitute br br the acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old <UNK> that it was <UNK> br br despite having elizabeth <UNK> this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> when he went out to the west coast in addition to his dreams about las vegas he <UNK> with the idea of acting he was a good looking guy and about 7 years younger than his pal george raft so it wasn't such a crazy idea br br warren beatty was <UNK> when he made this movie and despite the hair <UNK> he's too old for this part beatty was miscast <UNK> should have been played by someone like alec baldwin <UNK> was a tough guy feared by his <UNK> beatty just doesn't <UNK> menace br br this was a vanity project for beatty who hasn't come to terms with the fact that he's no longer a leading man br br the other big annoying miscast is <UNK> as george raft raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms none of which <UNK> even attempts to match you never once believe that <UNK> came from the streets br br warren beatty and robert redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair <UNK> and now it ll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts
<START> the unpleasant home invasion genre can be <UNK> back to wes craven's early <UNK> last house on the left with such nasty off shoots as i spit on your grave wrong way and the <UNK> soon following in the footsteps of that film here in this early '80s italian offering the same plot is <UNK> once more with the twist being that this one is set on a <UNK> train la <UNK> del  known in english speaking countries as terror express  starts out surprisingly well but about twenty minutes in it takes a turn for the worse as the sex scenes start to gain <UNK> over the more serious action and suspense br br david phil and ernie three rich <UNK> who <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> others board a <UNK> <UNK> express in italy the train is full of other passengers among them prostitute juliette <UNK> who rides the train frequently and has struck up a deal with one of the <UNK> to act as a kind of <UNK> <UNK> the male passengers to part with their cash for a night of passion in her sleeping <UNK> the three <UNK> quickly set about <UNK> the passengers with their aggressive drunken behaviour but matters get more serious when they <UNK> control of an entire car on the express and <UNK> themselves in from the rest of the train pretty soon they are <UNK> in their temporary a young wife is raped by two of the <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault and later the <UNK> trio force the male passengers to role a <UNK> in order to decide which one will rape a 16 year old virgin travelling with her parents a concept made <UNK> tasteless by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game the only passenger who seems prepared to fight back is a convict who is being <UNK> to germany but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs br br la <UNK> del gets off to a decent start various intriguing characters are introduced and the three <UNK> are shown to have a genuinely unsettling influence over the <UNK> though the story is clearly the stuff of exploitation the opening scenes are built up carefully and the film seems to be rising above the usual <UNK> level of its genre things fall apart during a horrid scene in which is sex <UNK> in a toilet <UNK> by two of the thugs the scene is <UNK> filmed and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the instead we are being asked to feel turned on this is <UNK> at its worst further <UNK> rapes follow but the rape sequences involve too much lingering camera work over acts of <UNK> sex and the female <UNK> one sequence featuring the 16 year old girl <UNK> on the brink of hard core and feels particularly wrong by the end of la <UNK> del it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller for the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense lovers of sleaze will <UNK> in it others might want to look elsewhere
<START> legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad <UNK> played with wicked <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> dies of a heart attack a bunch of drama school students steal corpse from its crypt and take it to a <UNK> mansion so they can party with it comes back to life and picks off the rude <UNK> for his grave writer director norman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a fresh original and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise offers a neat <UNK> of the <UNK> hollywood <UNK> and does a <UNK> job of maintaining a <UNK> misty and spooky <UNK> atmosphere the kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods with a gal being set on fire a <UNK> <UNK> the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a <UNK> can peck away at it and another poor <UNK> being crushed with a <UNK> coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar b flick faces <UNK> has a deliciously eye rolling ball with his flashy role leon contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed up director <UNK> <UNK> adds some class as <UNK> psychic medium mrs rohmer plus there are nice turns by <UNK> as jerky drama student <UNK> saint jennifer <UNK> as the sweet meg jeffrey combs as the geeky <UNK> and scott <UNK> as the nerdy <UNK> popping up in cool bits are chuck <UNK> mitchell as a detective patrick wright in one of his <UNK> policeman parts and <UNK> as a corpse joel king's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look the moody score by jerry <UNK> likewise hits the <UNK> spot a fun little fright flick
<START> after renting one true thing the other night i have learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted i have never seen such a real life portrayal of a cancer victim on screen like meryl delivered she deserves the oscar nomination but she has some tough <UNK> in the running all i can say is beautiful film great acting from streep and meryl streep revealed her one true ability in this excellent film
<START> this isn't exactly a complicated story it's not a mystery or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an <UNK> part of the dialog claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you <UNK> get <UNK> may apply to a very few films however this isn't one of them those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked with ghosts this doesn't apply the main flaw in this movie is an absence of detail it jumps from one character to the next never giving enough substance to any one set of scenes to allow the involvement of those watching because of that you don't connect with any of the characters you don't get to the point where you care either the main actor is gone just as the movie seems it's going to redeem itself or their actions are despicable and you're not inclined to anyway <UNK> to go very far to help is a good example his <UNK> to commit himself further mirrors the overall tone of his part the only characters you may <UNK> feel for are when she's being <UNK> and then tortured after her rape by <UNK> any focus on her character is pretty much gone following that the only other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the movie centered around <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> with family and her fathers all out attempt to force <UNK> into <UNK> a bogus confession and getting his daughter back then just as things start to be developing again they're gone from the movie i've read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didn't know what it wanted to be etc i found that basically it succeeded in not being much of anything from <UNK> return and the <UNK> viewing of daughter by <UNK> everything seemed nothing more than contrived without much of a storyline no effort to really examine the <UNK> times they lived in took place the essence of who <UNK> was didn't <UNK> other than his actions or lack thereof proving him to be more self centered than anything else as for his art the movie seemed intent on <UNK> a few of the paintings he did but again away another opportunity in <UNK> the reactions to this work rather than the work itself to sum things up best the movie had no <UNK> it grossly lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered and upon ending left you feeling like what you'd just seen was a series of <UNK> attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without adequately engaging the viewer in any of them you can't watch something like this several times expecting it to improve with added examination there's just not enough to it to waste the time it's not a case of your missing out on something it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good just aren't there as for best film ever made it's not even the best film i've watched today
<START> and atmosphere this film has but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes almost <UNK> so in early scenes in his which he <UNK> in for a <UNK> to investigate the creepy mansion of dr <UNK> <UNK> what wasn't clear to me was why would have wanted his <UNK> dead if as in the case of helen angela <UNK> he didn't want her to run off to get married he would have accomplished the same thing by having her <UNK> br br other abound as well after setting an early wedding date with helen the fiancée is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture the presence of a band of <UNK> at the time of <UNK> death provides merely a <UNK> and what could have been an interesting murder tool a <UNK> snake is <UNK> by the fact that it was not a <UNK> the musical <UNK> of the indian man servant notwithstanding br br stewart competently portrays <UNK> <UNK> dr watson though he takes some getting used to if <UNK> bruce is more your cup of tea as <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> menacing a <UNK> that would be put to good use as <UNK> nemesis professor <UNK> in two later films <UNK> the triumph of sherlock holmes and <UNK> murder at the <UNK> br br with repeated and an <UNK> camera it's surprising that the story line isn't more <UNK> than it is it's integrity is generally <UNK> even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps i guess that would be my main complaint with the film as mentally <UNK> some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the

<START> i rented this dvd because i'm a big science fiction fan but this thing i won't call it a film because it was obviously shot very quickly on video seemed like they made it up as they went along i'm still not sure what it was about there's these guys dressed up in some weird s m outfits and i guess they're from another planet anyway not much makes sense in this low low low budget film if it was their first film i'd cut them some slack but i think it's like their <UNK> film and it's really really bad br br very bad acting not one good actor is this movie this director must have been out of his mind to even work on a horrible film like this don't waste your time or money on this dvd please people don't it is not even worth the 99 cents i paid to rent the dvd in fact i'm going to tell them the dvd was messed up to get my money back i don't believe in giving anything at all a bad review but i must here my advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship please find another profession to get into how could you make a rotten movie like this i would give this negative stars if possible it's that terrible

<START> the film opens in a <UNK> british men's club full of <UNK> in leather <UNK> smoking <UNK> this is world a <UNK> delivers a small box to him which he opens to find a pair of gold <UNK> the site of the <UNK> sets off a <UNK> about the time he spent in the company of <UNK> the rest of the film is flashback br br golden <UNK> has been a long time favorite of mine and is probably the most romantic movie i know <UNK> plays against her usual type here she's dark haired <UNK> and not in the least bit mysterious instead of a femme fatale tower of strength and <UNK> sets out to use all her resources to help survive and reach his goal to make sure that he's a really convincing gypsy she <UNK> his ears and has him wear her dead <UNK> golden <UNK> with his clothes and some grease she transforms him from an <UNK> british gentleman into a wild and sexy looking man br br when i was growing up i used to hear the song golden <UNK> which is sung in the film i think the tune is a little by <UNK> there's a story the <UNK> know is true that when your love wears golden <UNK> she belongs to you
<START> a clever and bizarre angle to beauty is in the eye of the <UNK> at times you think this is campy and over the top but the underlying poetic soul comes across strong and believable thanks to the performances of the two leads one worth tracking down
<START> i was given this film by my uncle who had got it free with a dvd magazine its easy to see why he was so keen to get rid of it now i understand that this is a b movie and that it doesn't have the same size budget as bigger films but surely they could have spent their money in a better way than making this garbage there are some fairly good performances namely jack beth and <UNK> but others are ridiculously bad <UNK> for example this film also contains the worst fight scene i have ever seen the amount of nudity in the film did make it seem more like a porn film than a sci fi movie at times br br in conclusion awful film
<START> this has been edited for space br br chan <UNK> <UNK> new film is a complex film that is not easy to <UNK> <UNK> a horror movie the central character is a vampire the film actually has elements of comedy <UNK> melodrama cultural invasion and its <UNK> of <UNK> invasion of a body romance and few other things as well it's a film that has almost too much on its mind the film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic european literature in this case <UNK> <UNK> it's an odd mix that doesn't always <UNK> but none the less has an incredible power here it is almost 24 hours since i saw the film at lincoln center with a post film discussion by the director and i find my cage is increasingly <UNK> its not so much what happens is <UNK> its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of <UNK> in retrospect br br the plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to <UNK> for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease infected with the disease he eventually <UNK> and dies but because of a <UNK> of <UNK> blood its not explained he actually survives <UNK> as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been <UNK> to the sick unfortunately all is not well the priest finds that he needs blood to survive he also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire and its no not possible for him to go out during the day things become even more complicated when he becomes <UNK> with a childhood friend and his family the priest some of his animal passions <UNK> becomes taken with the wife of his friend from there it all goes <UNK> br br an ever changing film this is a story that <UNK> through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been <UNK> altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was it's a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever <UNK> into something else its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways br br the film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the film br br the two of the strongest parts of the film are its <UNK> elements and its romance the vampire part of the tale is brilliant there is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the <UNK> that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside sitting in the theater last night i found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked i think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life it's <UNK> with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn't going to work its not the dark world of twilight or lost boys rather its something else i personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and <UNK> the sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool the romance is also wonderfully handled sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but it's the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special i love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other <UNK> for each other and unable to act the disappointment and <UNK> of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible <UNK> this is one of the great screen romances of all time it perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love and lust if you've ever loved deeply i'm guessing you'll find some part of your hear on screen i know i did the statement i just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad <UNK> to it it's both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion the tragic romance will break your heart br br i won't lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great especially the actors who i have <UNK> failed to <UNK> as amazing the whole doesn't always come together the various genres <UNK> elements and tones occasionally <UNK> against each other frequently i was wondering where the film was going i hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about <UNK> br br i liked the film a great deal i loved the pieces more than the film as a whole its been around in my head since i saw it and i'm guessing that it will do so for several days more like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward one of the <UNK> and most filling films of the year
<START> mr <UNK> left our common forum in june of 2008 shortly after going to the hospital for pains in the chest he had a history of heart trouble the media and comics everywhere covered the loss more than i or he would have ever expected but he was the grandfather of <UNK> comedy br br this recording was his last production and contains a large section dedicated to the topic of death and the <UNK> of life thereafter filming of the project occurred shortly after his birthday which he was happy to have <UNK> observed i have followed <UNK> career from the days of fuzzy black and white television and enjoyed his <UNK> record albums br br it is a <UNK> for any <UNK> fan to at least see if not own a copy of this particular show he was still fast moving and with great timing even at 70 as he would say he is not smiling down from heaven on you if he's doing anything at all it's not taking <UNK> lessons perhaps he's looking up
<START> a very bizarre bringing to the screen of william shakespeare's tragic love story br br the <UNK> family and the <UNK> family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence the hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy in the middle of all of this insanity are <UNK> and juliet <UNK> most famous star crossed lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems <UNK> when they realize whose family the other belongs to br br the film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original or close to original lines but the infamous troma <UNK> <UNK> the film from beginning to end that makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes but it is nonetheless pretty inventive <UNK> <UNK> in shakespeare has a particularly funny death scene 7 10 br br many differently edited and rated versions exist each contains violence profanity drug use and sex all with a big dose of <UNK>
<START> did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews i mean really it's a bit hackneyed and spike isn't that funny he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny there are so many mediocre <UNK> in this show like once the opening sketch was talk show apply directly to the <UNK> over and over and another that featured spike and another dude getting high and it wasn't even funny they didn't even do anything but sit around and laugh over and over ha ha and another that featured spike talking to a korean guy who ate duck and told him that he had a pet duck ha ha i mean really spike just gets funny guests on his show that's why people like this show
<START> i live in rome where the turkish director of this film lives and works from my italian friends i have heard many good things about his films so after seeing the preview i really wanted to see i am deeply disappointed one of the most pompous pseudo religious highly improbable and naive films i love film but this one is really heavy and bad the main character is really crazy and should be locked up in a <UNK> made me <UNK> with the negative character of an aunt who runs a dirty dealing company that only wants to make money and i consider myself an anti <UNK> that bad
<START> do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of any sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour is there even just a single genuinely funny parody film anymore all i see are zero quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera these movies are not funny they're not clever they're not entertaining they're just useless in every <UNK> way br br the <UNK> was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself sports movie it's the same thing though there are a few different writers for these films the wayans did some and <UNK> did some others and i'm sure there's another pair i can't even tell the difference in direction or humour to be honest it all seems like the same people wrote and directed them i can't tell if the <UNK> was done by the people who did scary movie or the guys who did epic movie or someone else it's just the same jokes from all the others br br if you have any shred of taste or value for humour don't see this movie if you have self worth don't bother seeing it if you have any respect for film making don't even consider watching it don't see it in any broke down <UNK> theatre that may still carry it don't rent it don't order it on netflix or pay per view don't it and don't even watch it for free on <UNK> avoid it like the plague br br the only <UNK> reasons i can see to watch this film are as follows br br a <UNK> if you like torturing yourself there's very few better ways b seeing a prime example of why to avoid anything that says fox atomic c you're being paid considerably high amounts of cash br br i really would not watch the entire thing if someone offered me 100 to do it it's just mindless mental <UNK> torment br br you might as well watch
<START> the <UNK> head is one of those peculiar <UNK> i've noticed that when something doesn't make sense people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings which its creator never intended such is the case here br br the movie is a stream of consciousness spectacle of the <UNK> floating in and out of various sketches <UNK> set pieces etc similar to the ones on their tv show but while the tv show was played for laughs this doesn't seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep <UNK> pseudo intellectual state that this brand of <UNK> <UNK> all in all it's the <UNK> doing the same <UNK> but now it's consciousness raising because the laugh track is removed there is not a <UNK> of humor or meaning to the whole thing it just <UNK> on with colored lights br br the music in head should prove to anyone beyond the shadow of a doubt that the <UNK> had not a <UNK> of <UNK> ability the tunes are mostly garbage the only one that's even <UNK> is song which opens and <UNK> the film but the thing is that was a <UNK> carole king song and while it's above average for the <UNK> it's below average by and king standards it's like hearing one of the old peter and gordon songs that paul <UNK> wrote for them you might think it's a pretty good song but then you find out who composed it and you realize it's a throwaway mike <UNK> song is maybe passable the rest is worthless <UNK> jones has i guess what the filmmakers imagined to be the big number in the picture since it's the only song presented as show <UNK> and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence but it falls flat too just because the song isn't any good br br i have to admit i always liked the <UNK> so the movie is a real disappointment sure they were cheesy but they were so cheerful about it br br they knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it but then they got ambitious in head they actually joke about being a <UNK> pop product but the truth is they wanted something more they wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists maybe not like the beatles but something approaching that head proves that they failed on all counts 1 out of 4
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film i had read the book a good ten years ago and was intrigued about how it would translate to film br br the screenplay is very true to the book which i was <UNK> by this is a <UNK> in itself these days the <UNK> were solid and <UNK> and the kept me shifting in my <UNK> even though i already knew the ending from the book br br an intelligent and well crafted film
<START> this movie is very good and the whole family would enjoy watching it when <UNK> q is of to her big night at prom she dies in a fatal car crash on her way to prom by kids who are drunk and high as the years go by house gets sold and a family moves into the house that she loves as the boy who now lives in the house sees <UNK> and is the only one who can the two team together with his little little sister and try to save parents from being broke staring amy jo johnson as <UNK> q this movie will fell your heart with comedy sadness and laughter i hope that you see this movie because it is very good but no one seems to have it on dvd or and it no longer comes on tv
<START> warning spoiler this movie is absolute crap it is not entertainment i haven't the words to describe the disgust that i felt at the end br br this is a badly made movie about the <UNK> of society during the whole movie i kept waiting for it to get better it didn't instead it just kept getting worse and worse br br when i see a movie that is as bad as this one i always try to find at least one good thing to say about it in this case it proved impossible i have not one good thing to say about it how bad did it get well here's an example towards the end dan <UNK> <UNK> and kills vincent <UNK> while reeves and diaz watch this is not entertainment
<START> black snake <UNK> is <UNK> it is over rich fantastically <UNK> strange and <UNK> unique and <UNK> in <UNK> of <UNK> flow <UNK> paints his portrait of the american south almost as a <UNK> land one would expect to see in a fantasy or ancient <UNK> epic and yet as far high above us his movies <UNK> they are still <UNK> <UNK> in the deepest darkest <UNK> there is br br as in traditional fairy tales <UNK> paints his portrait in black snake <UNK> using extremes and <UNK> sharp and stark character traits when coupled with such extreme acts as <UNK> a half naked white girl to a <UNK> in an attempt to redeem her of her sins <UNK> and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in <UNK> <UNK> the metaphor in that fairy tale film but <UNK> doesn't begin his film with once upon a time in this film and also in <UNK> flow <UNK> presents us with a different fairy tale a dark gothic fable of sex prostitution and ultimately redemption these themes run through the film's <UNK> like blood and <UNK> and bloom in its dark brooding setting br br but despite these harsh extremes <UNK> treats his characters like humans and creates extremely well executed three dimensional characterizations in <UNK> and <UNK> particularly <UNK> with their relationships with friend at the <UNK> angela and mother br br the acting is all around quite perfect one gets the feeling that both christina <UNK> and samuel l jackson were born to play these roles their characterizations are so intense and so severe it's even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters and they succeed admirably samuel l jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character which serves as a polar opposite to most of the character's he's played before with films like pulp fiction jackie brown <UNK> and others he has crafted for himself a <UNK> of the ultimate bad ass in black snake <UNK> jackson plays an old broken defeated and <UNK> character quite unlike anything he's done before and frankly it's just fantastic what comes as quite a surprise though is the casting of justin timberlake and more specifically the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable sure he doesn't have much screen time but like what <UNK> did with ludicrous in <UNK> flow he actually gets timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritating br br but what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere <UNK> creates the rural southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark dirty <UNK> <UNK> rugged kind of <UNK> to the entire film which more than fits in with the film's <UNK> and <UNK> aspects and by <UNK> all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of when <UNK> gets her <UNK> or a raging <UNK> that <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> plays his black snake <UNK> blues number for <UNK> <UNK> truly manages to create almost a fantasy world an <UNK> mythology to the rural southern setting and it works so utterly fantastically to craft unique vision br br and one can't talk about a craig <UNK> film without mentioning the music in <UNK> flow he <UNK> a soundtrack of down and dirty street wise hip hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision in this film the music works even better at <UNK> off and fully representing the unique atmosphere it is a rural blues soundtrack but it's the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blues you've ever heard and it sounds just absolutely fantastic br br in all it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old broken lonely god <UNK> black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from <UNK> there may have not been very much to write home about but this film is not about the plot and not even about the characters as well as they are crafted in the film regardless no this film is about the vision  and what a unique vision it is it is about the atmosphere the mythology the setting it is about anger fear redemption and most importantly the blues and it's all wrapped up in a unique entertaining stylized and impeccable <UNK> <UNK> has guaranteed himself a spot on the most promising up and coming directors list and with such a solid follow up to a great debut film <UNK> flow he will definitely be on my radar for future projects br br it also must be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles i've heard yet
<START> billy crystal is larry a writer who hasn't written and is suspected of murder in throw <UNK> from the train <UNK> danny <UNK> and anne <UNK> the phrase black comedy was invented for this insanity which is a take off on hitchcock's strangers on a train in fact owen <UNK> gets the idea of having larry kill his mother in exchange for owen killing <UNK> ex from watching that famous film i saw the movie <UNK> cross owen tells larry not that larry knows what he's talking about until it appears it's too late just like strangers larry a writing teacher claims that his ex wife played by kate <UNK> stole his book and put her name on it she has become a big celebrity appearing on oprah where she refers to larry as a beast owen is in <UNK> class he lives with an abusive <UNK> mother <UNK> and has visions of <UNK> her sticking a <UNK> in her head you name it it's not long after seeing strangers on a train that he's in <UNK> stalking <UNK> wife while she's <UNK> over a boat <UNK> trying to get an <UNK> owen stands behind her and creeps up soon the police are looking for larry to question him but he's at <UNK> where he's being encouraged to live up to his end of a bargain he had no idea he made you know <UNK> cross there are several scenes copied from strangers which are hilarious i especially loved <UNK> confession to the sleeping mrs lift <UNK> mother similar to when guy thinks he's talking to <UNK> <UNK> br br crystal and <UNK> are complete masters of comic dialogue and timing and will leave you laughing often out loud <UNK> is <UNK> funny a totally out there performance kim and rob <UNK> also have roles is <UNK> girlfriend and <UNK> has what amounts to a cameo br br the ending is very clever and the whole film will leave you laughing
<START> the concept of this movie is unique however its execution is less than special when i arrived at the cinema and realised that there were only about 15 people or so in the crowd i thought i had made a mistake however the true mistake was realised in shocking detail when the film has ended and i knew that i had wasted two hours of my life br br without the cruel <UNK> of the old man and the <UNK> funny friend this film would have rated 1 out of ten br br this film is special special because it is probably the worst film ever to be generally released to the public br br there is also the issue of whether you could call it a film or just an <UNK> for the probably crummy <UNK> br br if you are thinking of watching this film for the plot the humor the filming the locations then don't on the other hand if you like to experience both ends of the film production then go just take a book or a small game or just some novelty item
<START> it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better bargain bin movies out there i'd feel a bit cheated if i had paid for it but at about <UNK> 50 i felt that i definitely got more than my <UNK> worth br br the film can't quite decide if it wants to be mad max or one of the clint eastwood man with no name spaghetti westerns and as such is <UNK> with clichés from both even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in mad max is there br br that guy from blade runner also cops a good billing although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie br br favourite bit for me the punch up on top of the oil <UNK> if you look closely you can see the post apocalyptic rush hour traffic <UNK> past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven <UNK> out of each other br br get several in a few <UNK> and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel
<START> i do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which i think is for a big budget movie quite exceptional and daring br br i just wanted to remark that i am really fed up with the studios <UNK> and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children in the <UNK> we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time but of course it is likely that there are much more different cuts br br the result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie unless you live in <UNK> where the movie runs <UNK> minutes which sounds quite complete br br later on dvd and video the studios try to rob us further by selling us a <UNK> director's cut in germany there is already such a version around running <UNK> <UNK> minutes br br it would be nice if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art even at the risk of an <UNK> rating so that i as a viewer don't have to feel cheated and am taken seriously not only as a <UNK> of money
<START> leslie <UNK> is a very talented actor who made a huge mistake by doing this film it doesn't even come close to being funny the best word to describe it is stupid
<START> she's the man was the funniest movie i have ever seen i laughed so hard that i was crying it was also very romantic <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely gorgeous and can really act it sure doesn't hurt that he has quite a few <UNK> scenes either <UNK> and amanda have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together i love this movie when you watch make sure to watch the last deleted scene it was a huge mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie i highly recommend this movie amanda has never been funnier and <UNK> is going to be a huge star this is just the first of many for this bright new star
<START> this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it's like they're almost living the past over again <UNK> plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most there's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job however this movie is not for everyone many people who suffer from depression will understand problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself others might see the movie as boring because it's just so real that its almost like a documentary overall this movie is great and deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad
<START> <UNK> was a <UNK> of what the french call theatre de <UNK> plays where you find the eternal triangle man wife male or female lover many of his plays gave some of her best parts on stage and the great actress was the main reason to watch them for is not <UNK> <UNK> by a long shot the french audience remembers <UNK> theatre <UNK> br br still with me plays were not made to be filmed and this one is pretty mediocre material even if the screenwriters call lewis <UNK> to their rescue i like stewart granger and david niven and <UNK> <UNK> is eye candy but this might be their worst film being crude predictable even the <UNK> is ludicrous a <UNK> farce around a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a desert island where granger would be some kind of robinson niven his friday and <UNK> his girl friday
<START> i checked out this video expecting to like it wanting to like it i like foreign films i like beautiful cinematography i know the critics liked this film including my favorite roger ebert and i don't mind slow films br br well it's beautiful that's about the best i can say for it the plot is very thin the shots are very long the <UNK> are very meaningful the actors are very sincere and it seems like a very long movie i fell asleep half way though it woke up <UNK> the tape tried again it was a trial but i made it to the end i didn't like it any better for that
<START> the is set in a small <UNK> town called <UNK> on the eve of halloween as the <UNK> treat it like the second coming of christ or something i mean halloween isn't that important is it anyway sheriff pete burton gilliam has been called out to yet another murder as local boy ned co associate producer john william has discovered a body in the local woods could it be the <UNK> lady justin hamilton the central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers who knows being the fun sort of guy he is mark director producer robert harvey convinces his <UNK> kelly laurie reeves to ride out to a cemetery that his mate steven josh found the night before for a halloween party the idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to kelly she agrees along with steven a girl he picked up named <UNK> natalie woods their nerdy friend jerry tim <UNK> they all set out for a night of fun well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery however they soon discover that the legend of the <UNK> lady is far from the <UNK> story many make out br br edited executive produced written directed by christopher the is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film the script is very predictable dull doesn't deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever in the right hands with a decent budget the could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isn't it moves along at a fair pace but the on screen <UNK> is so poor that it doesn't matter i don't quite know what else to say other than the is a really bad film i can't see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it the dialogue is basic the character's are clichéd lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time there are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements what was that <UNK> keeping in that cage i'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it oh if you want to know what happens to jerry at the end then you'll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed assuming you can actually make it that far of course believe me it takes some doing br br director doesn't do anything special thinks bathing scenes in <UNK> light is stylish i can tell him that it isn't when your film is supposed to be set in the woods there's no atmosphere scares tension excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good forget about decent gore there's a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm a <UNK> stuck through <UNK> throat br br apparently the had a filming budget of 2 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release to be brutally honest it shows what about the retarded guy his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous the terrible special effects the camcorder cinematography the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through br br the is straight to video crap it has no redeeming features whatsoever it's low imdb user rating score is fully justified it's one of those films that within half an hour i was looking at the clock wishing the thing would just finish
<START> i hated this film simply put this film is so bad that i almost want to disregard ever watching it and never again mentioning it but on the other hand i can't resist a good bashing and if there's one thing that <UNK> almighty does for the audience it is that it brings out the best criticism br br the film a sequel to the much funnier bruce almighty starts out by <UNK> the audience to <UNK> <UNK> a mere supporting at best character in the original film that's right this film shows no jim carrey or jennifer not even a small cameo appearance you know your film is bad when the guy that agreed to do ace venture when nature calls won't even have a short walk on role but somehow they manage to keep morgan freeman as god while sitting in the near empty theater bored out of my mind at the lack of comedy i couldn't help but wonder how much money it took to secure freeman for this film then it hit me an hour ago it's just a throwaway role that takes up all of 20 minutes in the 100 minute film god just pops up in between scenes to tell <UNK> to build the <UNK> sure i know morgan freeman won't look at this film in a year and think it's as good as his roles in the <UNK> redemption and million dollar baby but it's easy money br br where was i oh yes the plot sometimes it's so hard to keep focused on the plot when you realize that you gave more thought thinking about the plot than the writer of the screenplay did anyway <UNK> steve carell has apparently left his job as a news anchorman for a job as a <UNK> yeah with no transition in between he never turns to his wife and says i think i want to be a <UNK> it just happens within the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition well as a <UNK> he is to partner for a bill <UNK> by john <UNK> character when suddenly god appears to tell <UNK> to build an <UNK> no hey how you doing <UNK> the weather bit just i want you to build an <UNK> evidence of bad writing <UNK> <UNK> that god is giving him clues to build an <UNK> after <UNK> a fan hold up a sign saying <UNK> 6 14 when he's walking past his son whose watching a <UNK> baseball game br br that's basically the plot of <UNK> almighty there are some random supporting cast members that do their best at creating comedy but they don't do very well because they aren't given hardly any screen time it's just your basic run of the mill family building an <UNK> film oh and also there's that obligatory scene where a father has to <UNK> his <UNK> plans with his kids and wife because he becomes busy with work they walk off disappointed but they understand as do all the other times in film this has happened just once would i love to see the youngest kid turn to his father and kick him in the <UNK> and tell him you're a real bastard for <UNK> your plans with us i'm going to turn <UNK> now there's also that drama that you'd expect from the father with his family when they realize the wife actually the three kids have no problem helping dad build an <UNK> that he's gone crazy and he claims god wants him to build a big boat but don't worry his family decides to stick with him <UNK> i just spoiled the drama br br another problem with this film is that there is hardly any good comedy going on i know the decision was made to rate have this be a pg film to get a bigger crowd reaction but i don't think i'm in the minority when i think that family humor is more than just guys getting kicked in the nuts and animals <UNK> maybe i'm wrong and that's what quality family humor has been reduced to and if it is please bring me more adult comedies so i won't have to sit through anymore of this crap pun not intended br br the ending is extra cheesy all of a sudden the film takes a dramatic cgi filled turn that makes me <UNK> to think how it is a terrible waste of cgi i bet it was expensive too finally after all that waiting we are told why god wanted <UNK> to build an <UNK> and boy oh boy i hated the reason why i'll spare the details but it was like watching or reading a murder mystery and having the killer turn out to be the person who walked behind the main character for one second and had no lines br br oh and then there's a nice touch at the very end the song gonna make you sweat everybody dance now plays over the credits and we are then subjected to the dancing of the cast i don't get it they spend 100 minutes <UNK> making a comedy and then they wrap it up with a thriller i swear i haven't been that scared watching steve carell dance since well never there you have it folks <UNK> almighty is the scariest film of all time br br all in all i thought it was a wasted experience i'm <UNK> at all the talented actors carell freeman and goodman appearing in this bore fest alongside lauren graham the woman from <UNK> girls that has yet to prove to me that she can act her way out of a paper bag but most of all i'm surprised at my will power to actually sit through the whole film without walking out br br rating out of
<START> ever had one of those nights when you couldn't sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was on that is how i ran across this tripe for myself i would have been better served <UNK> and turning for the <UNK> minutes i wasted with this film br br in its attempt to be real this movie's characters come off as such <UNK> stereotypes that the story should have been the premise for a wayans brothers movie the dialog please it sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this film br br the editing was horrible one of my favorite scenes involved a car chase down a bunch of narrow <UNK> cut to the characters being chased though and they are driving through a park complete with baseball fields in the background br br when any of our <UNK> get shot in this film he <UNK> miraculously through clothes that have no holes which is more than i can say for the plot of this predictable load of <UNK> <UNK> br br indie films can be great even if they are low on budget and effects but they still need to have some cinematic integrity if i could have given it a 0 i would if you watch it i hope it is on cable because even the <UNK> rental would be too much to pay actually <UNK> minutes was too much to pay
<START> ok when i was little and i mean like 2 or 3 not 6 and 7 barney was one of my favorite shows i then grew out of it and threw all my old barney tapes away so one day as i'm flipping through channels i see that barney now takes place in a and i thought um huh is this the right show once i realized it was i freaked why did they change the show's setting from a school to a ever since then the show has been absolutely terrible and the only reason i'm giving it a 2 is a because i'm nice b because of riff and c because in the old times the show was tolerable now i just hate it hate it br br 2 10
<START> black friday did this plot so much better which is why it is remembered and the man with two lives is just a forgotten <UNK> shed no tears was it's working title and it would have been a better one as he was a thoroughly evil character for most of the film br br philip bennett is newly engaged when he is involved in a traffic accident dr clark edward <UNK> has been involved in some experimental <UNK> on animals bringing them back from the dead his colleagues urge him to try his operation on phillip who has died as he is operating a dangerous criminal wolf is going to the electric chair and <UNK> <UNK> of the soul occurs when phillip <UNK> from the operation he has the soul of he is a changed person he is rude to his family and starts to hang around old <UNK> he takes over <UNK> old gang going by the name of philip bennett he also <UNK> <UNK> former girlfriend who <UNK> a rat bennett as wolf is determined to even up scores and starts to eliminate his enemies bodies pile up including the girlfriend and a policeman then his own family begins to fall victim br br but i hate those bad dream movies you always feel let down this film would have been better if he had stayed in character as and had a final shoot out <UNK> his fiancée would have ended up <UNK> but <UNK> with his brother br br edward norris the star had a big career mostly in b movies br br not really recommended
<START> or any stories reminiscent of the leopold and <UNK> case you may find this movie entertaining the cast includes robert <UNK> with stephen and <UNK> as the college students br br peter falk is his usual self pretending to be tricked by the <UNK> students longtime companion buried alive is excellent and should do more of these menacing roles basically the two frat buddies become tired of their demanding parents who expect nothing less than academic perfection <UNK> at the best schools will only be <UNK> if they <UNK> there is an excellent scene <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over the <UNK> after he gets a low grade threatens to cut off his trust <UNK> and later says to his friend i hate him i want him dead br br all is not well in beverly hills this is always an excellent theme i believe this film came out in 1990 right after the <UNK> killings if you watch a killing in beverly hills and then compare it to this film you may find some interesting parallels
<START> this movie is just plain dumb don't bother watching it believe me you're better off br br long and short of the plot a defense attorney represents a man who murdered his son and other children in defending him she comes across a wooden doll of <UNK> she takes the doll home <UNK> is possessed and begins to start killing people br br this movie moves very slowly only to have such a weak ending the plot is very bad and the dennis michael musical score is pitiful the story written by kevin s <UNK> is just pointless and evokes no horror or fear this is a far cry from his work on night of the demons and <UNK> which are decent <UNK> but nothing to write home about his directing is ok but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie any good br br in conclusion 2 out of 10 perhaps the <UNK> most boring movie i've seen all year
<START> i remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way chinese people were making films at the time they were admittedly inferior question but there was entertainment value here and that caught on for sure the kung fu <UNK> had begun and bruce lee and <UNK> chinese would soon follow either that or <UNK> chinese with jimmy wang <UNK> in any case this film was chosen to lead the way
<START> a multi millionaire marries a female doctor he hasn't worked in a day and she is devoted to her profession he sees her off each day something has got to give br br our hero henry fonda finally decides to do something with his life he becomes a salesman in a department store but is soon fired as <UNK> people need the job in the meantime dr helen hunt barbara stanwyck has given up her practice what's there to do br br kirk fonda buys a <UNK> hospital and the two shall now be happy <UNK> others while they <UNK> out an existence br br what's with the writing here when annoyed with her husband dr hunt says you've been acting like <UNK> this is supposed to be a comedy <UNK> br br a very boring tedious film very little going on here
<START> i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i <UNK> to buy the video when it came out br br while i won't go too far into <UNK> this film i will say that i gave it an 8 10 for all the reasons you can read in the other <UNK> reviews br br what i will say is this br br the first 10 minutes of this film are incredible it's as close to a <UNK> audience <UNK> as i've ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was <UNK> down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minutes br br everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end
<START> the spoof genre which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already gets <UNK> upon yet again by <UNK> with no talent no point no fun no originality just a few cheap bucks for the film makers br br it takes more than just <UNK> some recent movies and giving characters double meaning names to be satire to make people laugh any can pick up a <UNK> <UNK> and have some bad acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways to get you to laugh hysterically it doesn't work br br that's not comedy however the same old worn out <UNK> jokes ripped off from a middle school <UNK> done even more <UNK> than usual are all here if that's not enough there's a running gag of a bus running somebody over so funny right also one <UNK> poor scene does more product placement than michael bay again with the same unfunny results a musical bit <UNK> miserably pity carl once apollo <UNK> in the rocky series now stuck with roles in <UNK> like this br br lousy beyond words watching a <UNK> run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is probably a lot funnier too
<START> a stupid teen supposed comedy that revolves a serious of <UNK> including but not limited to a hooker being confused with a foreign exchange student girlfriend beating a girl loving a gay guy and the straight guy that loves her and bitchy none of the following is funny or even amusing nation <UNK> use to be hilarious back in the day now the name is sadly <UNK> with crap and this one is no exception i use to think was kinda cute when she was on boy meets world but it seems she let herself go and yes i know she has a name but into she does anything else worthwhile she'll stay as br br my grade d br br eye candy <UNK> gets topless bliss relies on a body double
<START> this is one of the worst pieces of cinema i have seen in some time this is also my first review so you can tell i must hate this film at lot br br don't get me wrong i like my serious films i don't like hollywood too much i tend to like french italian offbeat us or anything that tries to communicate something sensible br br but this was awful why 1 the plot such as it was was entirely unbelievable even though the director seems to be everything on a feeling of realism br br 2 the main character has nothing to recommend him does he smoke for <UNK> or to show us his angst for goodness sake this guy is meant to be an ex dodgy mafia lawyer are we meant to care more because that he is also one of the <UNK> <UNK> people you could ever meet and he <UNK> so he must have deep personal issues pop psychology at it's best in the final moments i almost <UNK> as he gets buried in the <UNK> best place for him and i thought that was about the only good scene or maybe that was because it was so close the final credits br br 3 the entirely tired and unbelievable interest in the main character from the beautiful girl she was there simply because beautiful girls always have odd sexual relationships with old old men with a deep and meaningful personality as demonstrated by smoking happens all the time in really bad films that is br br 4 the pace was so <UNK> i like slow i like careful but this was just <UNK> br br 5 50 a bunch of other stuff that i really can't be bothered to write br br awful
<START> hood rat is absolutely terrible this is a urban version of <UNK> i just can't believe this movie got made let alone distributed someone in universal studios thought that people would watch and like this movie the only good thing in this is ice t as the <UNK> he was funny br br the one thing i hate in movies is <UNK> up action once or twice is bad enough but the whole movie is like that every scene transition is some fast motion special effect the director should be banned from making movies forever br br trust me never see this movie
<START> all those that identify this as a simple rip off of <UNK> are there no other comments that you can make towards the movie on its own merits as an individual film regardless of its apparent similarities to other movies br br all those that question the <UNK> of the movie in terms of its stereotypical characters the obligatory gay the jock the disabled kid etc i'm not sure how long it has been since you were at school but regardless of how amateurish the acting may be the happenings that go one are surprisingly close to what may actually happen br br and all those that disregard the film as being so simple just six teenagers with the regular teenage angst that pushes one over the edge did anyone stop to think and take notice that the girl who took her life wasn't actually one of those six as one comment points out she had screen time of maybe max <UNK> the final scenes i think the point of the film is not only to make an issue of teenage angst and how far it can take someone but also that it is no apparently obvious who is always in danger of committing such an act suicide
<START> one dark night is a <UNK> in the 1980's low budget horror genre filled with retro <UNK> clothing and scenery <UNK> the viewer to a simpler time when horror films were just that horror br br nothing so intense that you can't understand whats going on the film tells a dark fable of what happens when you mess with the dead well acted by it's stable of scream queens and a fine directorial job by tom whom <UNK> in the time and makes you believe what he's presenting there is no who done it and certainly no big twist at the end it is straight forward and in your face horror from beginning to end with a lot of 80's humor thrown in for added spice i give it 8 simply because some of the special effects fall short towards the end of the film but at least there is no cgi perfect film for new fans to the 1980's horror genre or anyone looking to re live a fun night of classic horror bliss
<START> the star is one of about <UNK> 000 000 westerns that john wayne acted in during the 1930s well the number is a bit exaggerated but it seemed almost like this many this is because these b movies were quickly made with very low budgets in order to be the second or lesser feature in a theater most <UNK> were pretty cheap and tended to cut <UNK> to keep down costs and the star is no exception to save on costs incidental music is not used running times were kept to under an hour the writing was often rather derivative and the actors are mostly lesser talents and wayne himself was definitely far from being a household name at this time some of these wayne features are pretty good while others like this one are watchable but also rather silly and <UNK> i enjoyed this film and most of the others but it's probably because i cut <UNK> a lot of slack br br wayne stars as john <UNK> a us marshall investigating the actions of a local gang out to chase locals out and steal from the stage this is odd as the film was apparently set in the modern time or close to it as they used <UNK> and modern machine guns things you just wouldn't expect to find in the old west such <UNK> are actually pretty common in b westerns as gene <UNK> films for example abound with them wayne's sidekick is <UNK> played by <UNK> and real life friend of wayne <UNK> <UNK> br br the bad guy is an unknown figure referred to as the shadow and he <UNK> his <UNK> through a black screen that hides his face this sounds exactly like a character from a movie serial the sort of baddie that kids loved but <UNK> <UNK> at because they were so silly and at bit like or dr evil the problem is if you listen to his voice and pay any attention at all it becomes obvious early in the film that this shadow is george hayes now speaking of hayes this is the same guy who later in films was known as <UNK> hayes but here and in several other of wayne's early films he looks and acts nothing like <UNK> in the star he was well dressed <UNK> and clean <UNK> imagine that in real life apparently this was more the real george hayes though i doubt that he was evil now as you can tell from the last paragraph that there really is no mystery in this film you are left with acting passable and nothing more and stunts which were actually pretty amazing again and again one amazing stunt after another occurred such as men jumping from horse to horse and some great fight scenes all done by the way by <UNK> and his friends <UNK> was often john wayne's double in films and this went on for decades the problem with some of the stunts however is that it appears that the film makers actually killed a few horses to get those great stumbling horses bits seen later in the film up until about 1940 film makers often strung thin metal wire and ran horses across it at full <UNK> in the process the <UNK> legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently <UNK> one of the worst examples of this was the film jesse james where several horses were brutally killed leading to the american <UNK> association <UNK> that a representative of the organization be on film shoots to that animals are not hurt in the production so since about 1940 films bear this little <UNK> the star was made well before the <UNK> and i can't see how the horses did these tricks without being killed br br overall this is at best a time <UNK> due to a poor plot occasionally poor acting and an unbelievable cruel attitude towards the horses i am no bleeding heart but just can't understand this disregard for a poor old animal
<START> <UNK> <UNK> retelling of the garden of <UNK> story nothing new nothing shocking although i feel that that is what the filmmakers were going for the idea is trite strong performance from daisy that's about it i believed she was 13 and i was interested in her character the rest left me cold
<START> this movie is such a total waste of time i can't understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash oh i would have loved it when i was seven years old i think a seven year old child may have written and directed it br br there's no script no acting just rubbish the best acting is that by the fighting i think i could whip these ninjas and i am not someone you'd consider tough totally unconvincing and did not spark the least bit of interest i was <UNK> and laughing by the end of the first ten minutes of the film this is one that would turn people away from martial art movies great comedy bad action flick
<START> after having watched <UNK> nightmare one must have the impression of being a living hell with its population being quasi slaves delivering the finest fish to the well fed europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population in exchange for the fish they get western made weapons which the mainly unemployed population eagerly <UNK> to use because being a soldier is their only source of <UNK> br br so everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery not quite fortunately <UNK> nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely <UNK> the positive aspects in fact the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and <UNK> importance the has for the region br br for the countries around lake victoria the is the second to third most important source of <UNK> the <UNK> in the fishing industry are way above average has banned huge to secure the jobs of thousands of <UNK> the <UNK> states have met <UNK> to keep fishing on a <UNK> level cities at the lake are <UNK> from the <UNK> the have to pay for each caught fish and the <UNK> on the <UNK> and <UNK> furthermore has banned the local traditional fish which still play an important role feeding the local population br br by ignoring those positive signs the documentary <UNK> the badly needed western <UNK> and <UNK> and thus threatens to <UNK> the situation br br for further reading i can recommend two <UNK> the german alternative wing newspaper wrote on the subject http www <UNK> de <UNK> 2006 <UNK> <UNK> 1 http www <UNK> de <UNK> 2005 <UNK> 17 1 text
<START> with <UNK> raw energy and an <UNK> vision talk radio brilliantly explores the <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> private problems into entertainment via the radio br br eric <UNK> is sensational as barry a rude in your face talk radio host he's a natural for this kind of role and fine tunes one of the most impressive interesting radio personalities i've ever seen on screen the timing and delivery of his insults to his various <UNK> are <UNK> of genius br br alec baldwin also shines as <UNK> boss he demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ross but the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned seemingly brain dead teen played by michael <UNK> you have to see it to believe it br br oliver stone and robert richardson do a great job with the photography which is almost entirely confined to a single <UNK> room the claustrophobic feel of the movie perfectly mirrors its tone after all one of the major points of the film is <UNK> people's private moments to draw an audience stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience br br talk radio is a film with strong emotional and cerebral impact the likes of which are seldom seen today
<START> when the movie first started i thought cheesy the first ten minutes were really boring after the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics i started liking it the plot was different than anything i had ever seen now was it a horror not really it shouldn't have been as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary as it was the creatures where only there for a short time i can only assume this was for money reason br br the good side was that the movie was very entertaining it held my interest after the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension br br it was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights by the end i was hooked too bad hollywood didn't put more money behind this
<START> the plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only star power if we can call it that consists of joe <UNK> i don't know what is more shocking the fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it if you ever see the cover of the video you'll be able to read them someone even went as far as saying that the actress writer could be the leading lady of the 90's yeah and joe <UNK> could have more money than his brother martin if you want to check it out anyways i highly recommend watching the version of it at least you'll laugh a lot without going insane
<START> this 22 minute short short of a <UNK> to the later much better rock and rule features two folk singer mice who are going nowhere the female mouse jan signs a deal with the devil to become a hit rock star so it's up to daniel mouse to save her soul made in the late <UNK> this has all the <UNK> of said decade crap music crap clothing and hair style awful folk tunes this cartoon is featured on the second disc of the 2 <UNK> <UNK> edition of rock and rule it also comes with a making of that runs almost as long as the show itself br br my grade d
<START> i don't care what anyone says this movie is hilarious it combines the bleak seriousness of threads with an <UNK> blend of alternative comedy and the results are a severely dark but outrageously funny satire on the <UNK> of both the western and eastern at the time you gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life <UNK> of duck and cover or protect and survive br br imagine someone made a movie based on the dead <UNK> track sex makes the world go <UNK> and you're pretty close to <UNK> apocalypse add on top form as an insanely <UNK> <UNK> commander and you've got it exactly a worthy companion piece to dr <UNK> and that's saying something
<START> this movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director but still succeeded in being original and entertaining as well as in some moments thought provoking however i have to say the story would not have come across as well without the stellar performance of paul anthony as <UNK> he made the well written parts very believable and affecting and the more <UNK> written parts much more bearable also i have to mention the performance by alan <UNK> it was refreshing to see him in a part like this he brought a weight to his role that provided a very <UNK> element to the film as for paul anthony who is this guy why haven't i seen more of him someone give him more roles please
<START> soul <UNK> has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time and is my favorite one of the series br br the graphics are very well done much bigger improvement over the choppy in soul edge soul blade the characters have facial expressions hair blows in the <UNK> and they even blink br br soul <UNK> has always been known for it's interesting plots and characters and is no exception each character has his her background story that is detailed and well done my favorite character is <UNK> she's cute she's funny and she's a strong female character yeah i know she wears pink and has a boyfriend who she ends up saving btw but there seems to be more to her than that like all the other characters have flaws and <UNK> to their personalities so no character is perfect not even the good guys br br the music is beautifully composed for a fighting game series it doesn't sound <UNK> the vampire series nor does it sound like old school porn film soundtrack mortal <UNK> the characters have their own themes and a lot of the themes are done to match the culture of that certain part of the world i don't think there is a song on this soundtrack i don't like br br another cool thing about this game is to create your own anime like character create a soul you could make him her look as cute or as sexy or even ugly if you like however if you found a character that you like remember to take notes or else you won't remember how you created that character i found myself being very addicted to br br overall i think soul <UNK> is my number one fighting game series of all time it has everything i asked for what more could i want
<START> being the second last of <UNK> <UNK> films carmen is a parody of cecil b <UNK> drama with the same title it stands as quite obvious that <UNK> acknowledged film didn't impress the comedy king that much which he later admitted in his autobiography br br parodies were not a new experiment for chaplin he had done several of them already namely his <UNK> past and his new job and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films for instance in a king in new york br br chaplin does a very good portrayal of don <UNK> and <UNK> is very as good as carmen neither act as we are used to charlie is not the lovable tramp and <UNK> is far from an innocent little woman but that was not <UNK> intentions either a <UNK> on carmen is a somewhat odd chaplin film very different but includes good material nonetheless br br the main story is although very differently structured as in the original drama don <UNK> is very much in love with carmen but is not alone in that field carmen carmen the beautiful carmen is loved by all men under <UNK> but he has the big advantage that he is an officer and there we are this is the famous story about rivalry love greed and honor seen from a humorous perspective thanks to <UNK> and performances and to the wonderful wonderful music by george <UNK> which i highly admire this could actually have been a near comedy masterpiece it's time taken into consideration it could have been but unfortunately although it is a good pretty good comedy i don't feel it's fair to blame people who claim that a <UNK> of carmen is far from being a masterpiece but it's important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent but rather a result of conflicts concerning business when chaplin refused to re sign <UNK> contract after <UNK> his last film for the company police they took revenge by editing back all the scenes chaplin originally had edited out from carmen thanks to this the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny and the film turned out to be rather a ben <UNK> feature <UNK> played than a chaplin short naturally chaplin was in despair when he discovered what <UNK> had done and had to stay in bed for several days br br despite its obvious flaws a <UNK> of carmen is highly recommended to chaplin fans and to <UNK> of beautiful music
<START> <UNK> back and it's about time this time with the help of jennifer <UNK> and a little spell from voodoo for <UNK> well at least with this installment the camp is back this was the more gruesome of this series so far it has some good twists and some good action scenes br br this one was by far the most fun of the series and successfully if unintentionally bridges the gap between pure horror to horror comedy br br i am looking forward to seed of <UNK> it'll be a hoot br br jesus the music <UNK> gone to <UNK> since i've been dead <UNK> br br we needed the <UNK> as the doll <UNK> getting old the added comedic element and the better action scenes brings this one back up to equal the quality of the first when the idea was fresh and new ish br br 6 8 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this hokey movie left me <UNK> after just about any exchange of dialogue or plot <UNK> patricia arquette though pleasing to look at gives a below par performance from her usual mediocrity my friends and i have <UNK> the phrase beyond to mean anything really bad a <UNK> for <UNK>
<START> i have been collecting iron man comics since the early 70s and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies there have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for iron man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice so i was somewhat hopeful that this <UNK> version would be good boy was i wrong the dvd art is very misleading and presents an image that is not the movie fist off the good what little there is the art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good though with notable exceptions character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted now for the bad unfortunately the writers <UNK> to totally screw around with both iron man's origin and especially the on top of that they decided to do iron man and his opponents all in cgi bad cgi this makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon the cg work is often repetitive and glaring <UNK> are taken at times the cg battles are clumsy as well further <UNK> the fact that cg and line animation do not mix well the movie would certainly have <UNK> better had they <UNK> to actually draw all the characters another problem is that iron man is in his traditional red and gold suit for all of one battle and its not even the big fight at the end all this drags the movie down and it never picks up br br spoilers or <UNK> may follow br br the movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> then we are introduced to what looks like a chinese temple in the process of being restored and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the <UNK> things go strangely <UNK> progress in <UNK> the temple <UNK> it is james <UNK> tony long time friend seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster <UNK> is captured in a raid stark shown in a hot <UNK> with a lovely lady is informed of the problems and sets out to personally <UNK> the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with board executives who are pushing to have tony removed tony arrives only to have his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and blown to pieces tony later <UNK> <UNK> wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels he is saved only by quick action from <UNK> and a scientist eventually stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape but only after some loss of life while with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named li <UNK> and the two fall in love the temple is raised and four <UNK> beings all done in cg appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power stark and find trouble back home but manage to confront the without success in really stopping them first using the <UNK> armor then the more classic red and gold armor and finally everything returns to the temple and stark is back in the <UNK> gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be <UNK> <UNK> also in cg here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the <UNK> needs a host body to <UNK> this leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the <UNK> is little more than a ghost and isn't seen till the last 5 minutes of the movie ugh br br if you are an iron man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing and even non fans may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not
<START> after the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint <UNK> onto it oh ok i'll be generous and call it a star field we witness an alien <UNK> crashing into a <UNK> and being forced to land on earth a terrible looking model <UNK> lands on a terrible looking model field three nearby <UNK> investigate from the burning <UNK> a <UNK> like looking alien the emerges ok so i <UNK> it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver <UNK> the <UNK> are quickly killed by the laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people the towns sheriff jack <UNK> tom griffith is informed he <UNK> his deputy lisa kent <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> of men together to investigate meanwhile the has killed an unlucky <UNK> who stopped on the side of the road for a <UNK> his two annoying kids run for help they approach a house inside two young people are kissing the girl says <UNK> running towards the house the guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and <UNK> by the it kills the girl as well then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser maybe the ain't so bad after all once the sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun laser battle with the after possibly the most <UNK> gun fight in film history only the sheriff his deputy and a local man jamie <UNK> jamie survive but the is still alive bullets seem to have no effect on it the next day the sheriff visits the towns mayor bert wicker richard and his girlfriend mary jane <UNK> herman to get <UNK> to <UNK> everyone in the town he refuses saying a party he is holding for the <UNK> richard cannot be cancelled and that he doesn't want to create a panic situation the sheriff <UNK> the town anyway two doctors steven price george and ruth <UNK> anne <UNK> are attacked by the before they can leave however they manage to scare the away and survive together with the sheriff his deputy and jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien written and directed by don this has to be an amateur film made with family and friends look at the credits and see how many are involved for that reason i should probably cut it some slack but that still doesn't stop it or excuse it from being a <UNK> awful film in every department it has no story or purpose things just happen to waste time whats with <UNK> don <UNK> his ex girlfriend <UNK> monica <UNK> this and many more scenes add nothing to the film the script has no logic either why does the stick around the town once it's been supposedly <UNK> the special effects are embarrassingly bad just look at the effect when the shoots someone with his laser a computer effect an 80's spectrum would be ashamed of there's not really much blood or gore in it a ripped open stomach a severed arm and a <UNK> but they all look predictably poor credit where it's due the itself looks alright for the most part there's a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch less than stellar acting photography music lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through and the worse thing about this film it commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest sorry don mate but don't give up the day job definitely one to avoid
<START> the ten steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling the dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in irish short films really really embarrassingly bad the girl has to go down the 10 steps of the <UNK> to change the blown <UNK> she <UNK> her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner the mother an actress with very questionable acting skills answers the phone and in a loud <UNK> voice tells her not to be <UNK> as dad is <UNK> to impress his <UNK> the actress playing the <UNK> wife very successfully <UNK> the mother's poor acting when she tells them that their house is haunted the rest of the film consists of the father <UNK> his daughter down the stairs on the <UNK> the ten steps employs the stock techniques in camera movement lighting and music that one would expect in a below average horror film poor
<START> don't watch this film while or soon after eating br br having said that <UNK> will stick with you for the rest of your life like it or not based on the <UNK> philosophy that life is nothing more than man above ground to <UNK> the title sequence introduction this will more than likely contain the most intense and grisly imagery you'll ever see in a film br br there is no dialogue only image after image describing the cycle of life the film's combination of stark black and white photography <UNK> with some truly creepy background sounds work to drive home the <UNK> message br br the movie begins with god portrayed as a <UNK> and obviously insane man <UNK> open his <UNK> with a straight razor and subsequently dying in his own filth after his death mother nature emerges from his corpse to <UNK> herself with his blood and <UNK> and gives birth to man represented by a <UNK> of a human <UNK> on the earth br br the landscape is a <UNK> waste populated by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who eventually happen upon mother nature and man after a slew of violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and destruction of man these <UNK> proceed to pound the remains of the corpses back into the ground and the cycle of life begins <UNK> br br i actually rented this from blockbuster one night based on the cover art and hype content but this is definitely not a blockbuster type film don't expect narrative dialogue or any pulled punches this is intense imagery based on a dark subject br br i give this movie some high marks for the <UNK> and audio but i don't think i'll be watching it too often if again i like my movies dark and unique but this one is <UNK> more than i expected
<START> ninja iii is not quite as bad as enter the ninja the first part of this trilogy but it's still a very bad movie it will hardly please the fans of martial arts movies because there isn't enough action but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable <UNK> and needless violence as if the film wasn't already weak enough the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic the exorcist rip off the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the dominated heroine she is a beautiful and athletic woman which the director doesn't forget to exploit in various sleazy ways she just happens to be an <UNK> teacher i don't mind a little soft core exploitation but it must not pretend to be something else
<START> this <UNK> of the <UNK> is one of the <UNK> films i've ever seen filmed by a <UNK> in a strange unfamiliar mexico it's often said that the best films about america are made by <UNK> who can approach the familiar with an <UNK> eye but this <UNK> film is something else though set ostensibly in post civil war america this isn't an america <UNK> from myth cinema tv etc the film has an air of timeless fable about it while dealing specifically with western mythology br br director harvey uses the title horse as a focus for <UNK> stories all dealing with the traditional western clash of the primitive and <UNK> the former seems to have the upper hand the vast <UNK> and desert of the film's landscape is <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> of the mind the only brief sites of <UNK> are a <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> and their <UNK> from both of which <UNK> behaviour that is anything but <UNK> br br the basic story <UNK> three stories in one an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> having lost his <UNK> partner steals a <UNK> horse <UNK> wing so called because of its grace and speed in the second an indian white bull owner of this horse a <UNK> and kidnaps one of its female <UNK> in the third the spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favour of a murderous <UNK> spree br br although a <UNK> western the treatment of the indian is <UNK> unlike <UNK> his character is never explained forever <UNK> denied a voice except for an excruciating snatch of song when he's not a strange other he's a symbol whose role isn't entirely worked out at one point a savage <UNK> at another he <UNK> nature and freedom br br but <UNK> notes at the beginning that the film will attend to the period of before <UNK> in many ways the film resembles 2001 a space odyssey especially its opening sequence part of the film's power lies in the connections made between the three <UNK> characters forcing us to view the <UNK> struggles and <UNK> in a different light indian culture and <UNK> is linked by <UNK> ritual greed and murder both <UNK> and white bull are musical and alcoholic white bull is by both <UNK> and the <UNK> as a <UNK> revealing the <UNK> of used by whites who <UNK> the natives becoming themselves fathers br br unlike a traditional western concerned with making history <UNK> and progress this film is a double detective story <UNK> the past tracks remains br br what gives this film its remarkable <UNK> i think is despite <UNK> racism its <UNK> the climactic stand off is more like an <UNK> <UNK> the film itself <UNK> <UNK> dialogue for the most part creating the kind of visual and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> missed in the thin red line and something few hollywood directors would have <UNK> the existential <UNK> and quest <UNK> are more european myth than american resembling another british harvey keitel movie the br br most astonishing is the use of nature most westerns use landscape as an awe inspiring backdrop there is little sense of actually living in the west in many ways <UNK> wing is like a powell and <UNK> film with nature a powerful <UNK> character in its own right alive dangerous hostile beautiful there is a sublime scene reminiscent of a tale when <UNK> left as a trap by white bull in the trees is suddenly blown in the wind there is a haunting <UNK> magical thrilling effect more reminiscent of the <UNK> nights than a horse opera <UNK>
<START> once i knew that donald sutherland jack shaw henry fields was appearing in this film it instantly told me this was going to be a good picture to view most of <UNK> pictures are full of action and suspense and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind in this picture jack shaw did his very best to be a good guy and a bad guy while he was training a naval office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become a different person over night there is plenty of car chase scenes and plenty of stunt men situations which i would not want to perform this naval officer lived in a quite community with his wife and was a father but you would never realize that fact until the film reveals his horrible background secrets which he had to keep from his family and friends good spy film and great acting by all the actors
<START> due to rather dubious plate japan starts to slip under the sea initial <UNK> say it'll take about 40 years before the country is <UNK> but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and <UNK> it will actually take less than 1 year the government think he's a <UNK> but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out br br this big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of hollywood films of the late 90's i assume having seen none of them with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the <UNK> of the human well japanese spirit in acts of <UNK> and sacrifice and proving the power of love or something like that i e it's as naive in its psychology as it's <UNK> we all know that half the <UNK> would be out <UNK> and <UNK> the minute they thought the police had their back turned and the other half would just panic and be useless br br the film does have some very nice special effects but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent hollywood production would be it is at least as <UNK> <UNK> and lacking in self awareness as that hollywood film would be though and probably has even worse acting it does have the hot evil chick from battle <UNK> as one of the leads but she's not even slightly evil and is therefore much less hot br br the film is much too long at <UNK> minutes and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of <UNK> i certainly didn't care in the slightest whether japan <UNK> or not by the half way point and well before the end i was trying to think of ways to the process should i ever find myself in that situation for real br br but it does have nice special effects and <UNK> <UNK> is still pretty hot so i give it 3 10
<START> i'll give it a two because it has a lot of music otherwise it would be a one br br i saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first road picture i've seen i was expecting <UNK> better robert says this is the best of the road movies if that's true i <UNK> bother to see the others the best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie br br i didn't like the movie neither hope nor crosby came across all that well their characters weren't very charming the movie was not funny at all most of the dialog was just lame filler there wasn't much action there wasn't much spectacle br br the movie wasn't what i expected i was expecting more road but there isn't much they quickly make it to the palace and then most of the movie takes place there until the end i was also expecting a lot more of the famous road style of breaking the fourth wall <UNK> the characters talk directly to the audience or comment on the plot there was only about 4 instances of that one of those is an example of the non funny humor of this script br br hope the plot up to now to crosby crosby i know all that hope yeah but the people that came in half way through the picture don't crosby you mean they missed my song br br those are two weak <UNK> but at least they are actually jokes much of the rest of the script doesn't even have any jokes an example is br br crosby remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning <UNK> calling hope a rat br br that's not funny at all it barely even qualifies as a joke but that's the kind of non joke dialog that carries most of the movie many of the scenes don't even come that close to a joke just using generic uninteresting dialog like br br crosby hey <UNK> take me for you think that you can just throw me to the dogs hope well why not you did it to me didn't you crosby yeah but that's because i was <UNK> out for us you're not <UNK> out for nobody hope oh yeah well then why did i pay the check br br the above is just from my memory it's not exact but it illustrates to you what i mean br br and so on just generic dialog with no jokes at all br br my grade a waste of time
<START> mr bean starring the legendary <UNK> <UNK> was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s and i probably first saw it when i was around ten shortly after it ended so i was seeing reruns i certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time and didn't see too many episodes i didn't really get into the show until my late teens just a few years ago which was when i finally watched every episode unlike before it made me laugh many times and since then that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes br br mr bean is a mysterious self <UNK> <UNK> extremely naive <UNK> whose best friend is his teddy he is pretty much isolated from society and life is not easy for him as he constantly struggles with very simple things this is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge and has the mind of a child he finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes and comes up with very bizarre ways to try and solve the problems he faces not only does he often cause trouble for himself but sometimes for other people as well which he often doesn't tend to realize in other words mr bean is a walking disaster br br the humour in this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue the gags are almost always sight gags which is mostly what the show is about while there may be an occasional <UNK> gag i would say the vast majority of them are funny often hilarious there are so many highlights while mr bean is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made it's still great for many of those who like visual humour and due to the very limited dialogue you don't even have to speak <UNK> english to enjoy the show which is why it has received such a world wide reputation the show ran for a few years but the episodes were made very gradually so only <UNK> were made in total nonetheless it is a classic series and deserves its wide appeal
<START> the movie in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in bollywood perhaps even hollywood br br when the movie released i was a 8 year old and i heard it was a flop but i never understood till now why was it a flop but let me tell you one thing this movie would have more money by selling home <UNK> and dvds and by showing in tv movie channels than any hit movie in theaters this movie has been shown countless times in movie channels and i think even now the public love and the tv producers keep repeating the movie again and again i personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 100 times and i still love it br br the performance by both <UNK> khan as <UNK> and salman khan as <UNK> is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of <UNK> khan as a street smart guy his dialogs in the movie are hilarious the story is simple and <UNK> how it goes br br <UNK> and <UNK> are poor lazy <UNK> and come from a poor family of <UNK> and father is a <UNK> then they both get a news that a millionaire 's daughter from london is coming to india to look for a suitable match both <UNK> and <UNK> think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich therefore they both head out to woo <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> daughter in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry <UNK> the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing and then there is uncle <UNK> look alike brother who wants to take revenge from father since he is broke and dad is a millionaire his plans include kidnapping <UNK> to blackmail dad for which he hires 2 <UNK> br br but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie watch the movie to know then there is <UNK> kapoor as crime master <UNK> who is also incredibly funny br br the thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts <UNK> khan uses his brilliantly and salman goes like and for <UNK> there is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to ma <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> each and every scene is so funny br br i especially liked the one in which <UNK> khan and salman <UNK> get <UNK> from and they both go in a <UNK> having money in a bag that scene is so funny br br i recommend anyone who understands hindi or <UNK> to watch this movie this is one movie that i would recommend having a dvd and you will never regret
<START> what is often neglected about harold lloyd is that he was an actor unlike chaplin and keaton lloyd didn't have the vaudeville music hall background and he wasn't a natural comedian he came to hollywood to act and he discovered he had a knack for acting funny first in shorts then in features he made a name for himself as <UNK> luke a chaplin knock off with the glasses character that made him the all american boy rather than a grotesque lloyd found his <UNK> and his movies became some of the best produced during the silent era br br he developed a reputation as a <UNK> in some shorts and <UNK> this in some of his best movies safety last for <UNK> sake girl shy he was more popular than either chaplin or keaton during the <UNK> and he became very rich before the <UNK> of sound br br the first sound movies were often disasters to get the most out of their sound too much dialog was used in many movies br br <UNK> acting skills were after two decades <UNK> for <UNK> he didn't have a bad voice its high pitch suited his glasses character and his sound films weren't the <UNK> disasters of legend yet silent movies had been raised to a high art especially <UNK> which did not <UNK> on budget and were extremely well crafted with the introduction of <UNK> movies had to learn to walk again and they made some <UNK> br br though he tried to move with the times and <UNK> sound <UNK> best bits from his early overly talky <UNK> were still visual such as the scene in movie crazy where he appears to be riding in a <UNK> car but actually <UNK> a ride on his <UNK> br br trying to <UNK> the <UNK> antics that made him famous as he did in feet first was <UNK> in safety last his best movie and the one that deservedly or not shoved lloyd in the box as a <UNK> comic he played a determined young man climbing to the top safety last had a natural structure that <UNK> to his character's <UNK> the side of the building he was obviously afraid but his fear added to the humor in feet first he arrived in a <UNK> building <UNK> position by accident his frantic cries for help <UNK> from the humor his character was pathetic and cringing <UNK> to save his neck possibly an accurate statement of the 1930s but not amusing br br harold lloyd was not <UNK> in the past like some wacky norma <UNK> he <UNK> sound and tried to take his movies in different directions growing and changing with the industry when feet first failed he left the <UNK> business and made a satire on the talking movie industry movie crazy just as he had to <UNK> through many movies as <UNK> luke before <UNK> his place in movie history with the glasses character he had tried several directions in sound movies before hitting his <UNK> in sound which he did with the br br in the he plays a <UNK> son <UNK> in china who <UNK> gets elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests when he finds out the truth he sets himself the task of cleaning up the town only in his early forties lloyd could still act the <UNK> young man br br yet the was another box office failure and lloyd made only three more movies including the <UNK> way of his chief <UNK> chaplin still had silent movies in him and keaton was hopelessly <UNK> the and the <UNK> way suggest lloyd might have <UNK> sound comedy if he had been a little younger or if audiences had given him the benefit of the doubt after his early sound br br though the movie has been unfairly <UNK> about the way <UNK> character <UNK> up the town it suits him from his days in shorts lloyd wanted to scare his audience and the climax of the achieved it yet again in a surprising way until the trick is revealed it appears gruesome and then come the laughs br br viewed as a product of its time the is charming and funny a very well written sound comedy well acted by lloyd directed by sam taylor its curious blend of drama and sly humor make it look almost like a frank <UNK> or preston <UNK> comedy
<START> just as in columbo we see the <UNK> occur right at the beginning what follows is an <UNK> web of lies sex blackmail and murder the investigating officer adam arkin is even somewhat of a <UNK> not unlike columbo it is william h macy as the movie critic suspect who carries the film constantly <UNK> and turning the plot sends macy deeper and deeper into the <UNK> of his perfect crime william h macy fans will enjoy a slight case of murder as will those who like crime <UNK> with all kinds of delicious possibilities add some well timed comedy and this is very similar to a fine episode of columbo highly recommended <UNK>
<START> the film shows relations of the dying mother and the son who is very attached to her and definitely loves her what does it show it shows their living in very poor conditions it shows how <UNK> they walk really he is bringing her but what do we see further after their <UNK> he walks alone at the same places where they walked together it is not possible a person who love and care about another dying one would do everything to make the life of this one better he would not have a free minute to <UNK> to be alone with <UNK> and if he finds a few minutes a month for that he would run away from the places where he has usually to be another thing the author devoted this film to <UNK> we see he learned many <UNK> visual effects but in <UNK> film they are only effects they do not support any senses or mood someone has compared this film with mirror there is nothing common except these visual effects mirror is a great film and this one is just poor imitation
<START> wtf do any of his books movies end in a happy ending the <UNK> was good but <UNK> enough with the depressing endings already i'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life understandable but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days don't we already know what really happens in real life can't we for one moment an hour and a half live <UNK> through a movie that ends on a happy note that gives us hope for our own <UNK> br br yeah <UNK> i know but for real i think we need to <UNK> movies that end like this one with a warning beware no happy ending
<START> walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years the script for james <UNK> sidekick is about as <UNK> written of a part as wesley <UNK> on star trek <UNK> and is played with about as much conviction br br on this show people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life everyone is <UNK> everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly that's not how life works that's not how people are this show doesn't take place in this reality br br the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her with walker everyone on the show including the bad guys act like he's the sort of hero that <UNK> and fairy tales are made of and time itself <UNK> to his <UNK> the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley <UNK> for the serious parts and the scriptwriter for bob <UNK> funniest home videos for the humor parts got together and wrote all the scripts for this show br br this show is for people who think that good always <UNK> over evil it's for the elderly it's for <UNK> <UNK> it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion it's for people whose drug of choice is their television br br i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years br br i used to like chuck norris but this show has forever <UNK> him in my mind i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show
<START> i actually belong to the <UNK> <UNK> 101 specifically is trying to target so i can see that as much as it tries to be <UNK> to people my age the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to the show revolves around the <UNK> <UNK> school in existence and the lovely incredibly <UNK> attractive gang of one sided characters who inhabit it as is the tradition amongst kids networks the cast is an array of skinny white kids with the token black guy of course br br the story lines all <UNK> around <UNK> and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma such as not wanting to attend gym class resulting in <UNK> <UNK> a scheme to save the day for all her friends there is generally a b line revolving around either a one sided guest character or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations such as having a <UNK> of <UNK> in a <UNK> room and no one <UNK> these plots often play off stereotypes such as any character who pulls good <UNK> in <UNK> must by <UNK> completely lack social skills the majority of episodes have the continuous and <UNK> will they won't they chase <UNK> dynamic br br the characters unfortunately are all incredibly one sided there is <UNK> the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything chase the constantly <UNK> still but rather endearing best friend michael the token black guy kudos to christopher massey for managing some genuinely funny one liners lola the theater chick meaning she dies her hair and 75 of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater logan the <UNK> <UNK> dustin the <UNK> little brother and quinn the science geek the few words i spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely br br <UNK> 101 does manage to be entertaining at times but the serious flaws in the system of values it <UNK> are a major <UNK> <UNK> who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi feminist <UNK> and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless still manages major character flaws for example when lola was first introduced she was believed to be a <UNK> girl <UNK> tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared <UNK> room for being freaky br br as for the acting it is quite clear that jamie <UNK> spears landed this role because of her name not because of talent although she has definitely improved as time goes by it is clear she is not a born actress which greatly affects the quality of the show as most of the plot lines <UNK> around her character the supporting cast is surprisingly good especially considering the material they have to work with they deliver quite a few good one liners for comic relief if the plot hasn't yet <UNK> into obscurity br br all in all <UNK> 101 is a flawed view at high school life and anyone past their limited too years shouldn't expect much from it
<START> definition of documentary a work such as a film or television program presenting political social or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often <UNK> of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration the key word here is informative i love they might be giants and barely learned a thing about them br br the interviews with all the celebrities were pretty much worthless i don't care what sarah <UNK> thinks of anybody and <UNK> straw was downright irritating and is listening to people <UNK> lyrics like they were supposed to be funny interesting it was neither i think that was the problem the movie spends time discussing love for coffee so what millions of people love coffee was the presentation of the material funny no there were hints that both men are married yet it was never discussed and what about the solo material they did what motivated them to do it these type of questions are not addressed nor answered br br i could go on and on with the <UNK> i did find the segment on <UNK> a song very interesting if you want to learn about they might be giants just buy a few <UNK> and listen seriously this movie is a gigantic disappointment i can't believe so many folks gave it a 10 incredible
<START> i rented this movie primarily because it had meg ryan in it and i was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one not only is she not on screen much but nothing her character does is essential to the plot her character could be written out of the story without changing it much
