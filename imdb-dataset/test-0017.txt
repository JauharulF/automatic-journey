<START> a root <UNK> without <UNK> is more amusing this movie is disturbing and pointless there is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot line what in god's name were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie the acting in this movie is so incredibly bad even from actors who are usually pretty damn good the in laws is a funny movie the <UNK> is a hilarious movie the big <UNK> is a humorous movie this movie is just dumb i cannot even begin to <UNK> the kind of sick mind it takes to write the novel that this movie is based on i honestly cannot think of even one nice thing to say about this movie it just doesn't make any sense people please i beg of you do not see this movie you will regret it for the rest of your life this movie is not the worst ever made but it is definitely right up there on the top of the list
<START> i too am a house party fan house party i is my favorite movie of all times house party 4 is a disgrace to all of the and to kid n play this was supposed to be part of a series really there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans <UNK> kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie b c its kind of focused on teens but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance you can tell how good it was b c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters immature was in house party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy but they should have represented right they should have left it at house party 3 i am 27 years old and i have been watching house party i since i was 11 when it came out in 1990 16 years ago and i have been a fan ever since when i first seen house party 4 i was like what are they really thinking about there was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies i thought it was a black <UNK> <UNK> days off
<START> don't quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldn't have been much comedy i also don't think that a comedy needs to make you laugh <UNK> twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesn't change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic i'd say but happy it's a light hearted movie with a feel good ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to and i'm glad they didn't show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly
<START> the <UNK> and the drama included in the movie is fantastic but the facts and the research is far from solid when <UNK> dr where the documentary tries to establish a connection to mary <UNK> from dr later <UNK> it should be used for literary purposes ie <UNK> of that time not for a historical figure in fact he states he does not believe the <UNK> in is mary <UNK> he further comments on his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary but rather for information regarding acts of philip a literary work in the 4th century br br so what we have here is a director that took one clip for a 4th century acts of philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century <UNK> <UNK> a very sad stretch and dr calls the jesus mary <UNK> connection as science fiction as this documentary should be rightly labeled
<START> marlene <UNK> is magnificent as <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> who drives all men to despair in <UNK> von the devil is a woman her performance has nothing to do with <UNK> in any conventional sense but she's <UNK> a true star in full command of her material but she's the only good thing about the film she's so good she keeps you watching this <UNK> i doubt if any other actress could have done the same br br the story is an <UNK> lame melodrama surely pierre novel was better in which <UNK> amoral <UNK> ruins the lives of two friends played by lionel <UNK> and <UNK> romero with a <UNK> <UNK> on and for von <UNK> it's an ugly looking movie maybe in keeping with its fairly ugly subject matter <UNK> on the other hand thought enough of it to remake it as that obscure object of desire with a greater emphasis on the <UNK> aspects of it all down to casting two different actresses in the same role neither film is either director's finest hour and while the <UNK> version may be the better film it is <UNK> you remember
<START> i knew it was going to be awful but not this awful as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen not a damn thing happens all the characters are dull and the story is stupid and incredibly boring plus the ending is especially lame the only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of michael <UNK> however he is wasted here and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever plus i <UNK> out loud when the movie was over it's like the movie had no plot and it was all about nothing and ice t is god awful even though he is ok in some stuff plus <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> had no chemistry together at all there's one scene that the director tried to make emotional but he fails miserably as <UNK> <UNK> didn't really show all that much emotion however there is a decent car chase scene but that's not enough for me to recommend this god awful film plus the dialog is atrocious avoid this movie like the plague not a damn thing happens please avoid and trust me on this one you may thank me <UNK> the direction is horrible fred <UNK> ray does a horrible job here with shoddy camera work laughably cheap looking set pieces terrible angles laughable use of stock footage and keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace the acting is terrible michael <UNK> is nowhere near his usual amazing self he looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever his character is also extremely dull as i can't believe he signed on for this piece of garbage he also had no chemistry with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> still rules ice t has barely anything to do and also looks bored and he didn't convince me one bit is not very good here he had somewhat of a <UNK> character i didn't like him <UNK> <UNK> is pretty but was really terrible here she didn't show much emotion and had no chemistry with <UNK> and as a result i didn't give a damn about her character art owen <UNK> kathy <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the cast are bad as well overall please avoid like the plague fred <UNK> ray and steve should be ashamed of themselves bomb out of 5
<START> i love low budget movies including those that are intentionally or un intentionally funny excess fake gore violence etc br br this however is beyond stupid once you see the ending you'll say what the hell was the point of all the killing scenes with no one around except in a couple to witness them and how did the ending actually come about i won't give the whole story away for those dumb enough to actually watch this <UNK> is like a psychic jason first she's outside the window with a body and 15 seconds later she's in the living room <UNK> the whole thing is a setup for a newcomer they pull off graphic kill scenes the <UNK> <UNK> in the eyes that only chris angel mind freak could pull off and again the very end was pre <UNK> <UNK> min waste of time i've seen one of the directors other films and it was almost as bad give me 20 grand and i could do better this really deserves a big fat 0
<START> there were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out and out <UNK> and yet they are made to look good i never bought into that stuff the screwball comedies were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the fred astaire films br br here barbara stanwyck plays a famous country magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona and her job she even lies to a guy about getting married another topic that was always <UNK> in classic films br br she's a new york city woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies etc obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track i guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love <UNK> etc etc please pass the <UNK> bag br br most of this film is not funny stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre as for dennis morgan well pass the bag again
<START> oh boy i really <UNK> <UNK> in space i think this deservedly rates worse than <UNK> it goes nowhere and growth was more exciting than this tripe br br poor she's so misunderstood smug rocky <UNK> around and thankfully there's no mention from about his gay <UNK> there's a lot more talking a really awful to watch space marriage on the rocks and crappy space effects cut outs then there's bobby you decide who's more annoying bobby or the personally i'd <UNK> them out of an <UNK> into a black hole not before first <UNK> them to killer flesh eating alien mutants br br at least there's she's just a <UNK> girl
<START> i have no idea why people are so crazy about the show it is so boring the jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny it's like alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background my friend and i just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other what's so funny seriously every time we watched that show you wouldn't hear any laughing or <UNK> just a blank look so we stop watching it i am personally a fan of sitcoms so i tried to watch the show but the show us such a disappointment this show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever
<START> freddy <UNK> has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the <UNK> <UNK> about russia <UNK> <UNK> a nasty guy as the president who wants to return the country not so much to communism but more to <UNK> <UNK> in fact his political <UNK> could have come straight out of <UNK> <UNK> rather than marx and the <UNK> has the latest weapons of <UNK> destruction to achieve the ethnic <UNK> of the russian <UNK> american <UNK> with the russian <UNK> to realise his <UNK> <UNK> dream but then enter dirty pat <UNK> and yep things get really down and dirty he's a former us <UNK> turned drifter jason monk who is <UNK> by the british government to see what the russians are up to as a corny <UNK> <UNK> character who is no monk has <UNK> a russian beauty <UNK> played by the gorgeous <UNK> on his previous missions to the former <UNK> state <UNK> does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil russians but young unknown actress <UNK> steals the flick as his <UNK> 18 year old russian daughter <UNK> who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved mother russia
<START> i was quite excited when i saw this film in competition at the <UNK> film festival along with elephant and a few others i thought the issue of american gun violence culture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for film goers the press release promised in not so many words a red for the gun violence crowd something to make us <UNK> our <UNK> shoot em up mindset in this country br br after waiting until after 9 15 to be <UNK> for a <UNK> screening what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me we were finally let into the <UNK> to see the film on <UNK> where did the advertised <UNK> print go i think i just answered my first question br br the result is an <UNK> mess we get the gun in a <UNK> with the most unrealistic i have ever seen and i do know more than a few the film then <UNK> into irrelevant character development only because the characters are either a stereotyped b losers c stereotyped losers and or d racial caricatures it takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement and once we are there we wish for the inane conversations between the couples and or the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br the film finds it's conclusion but not without leaving any cliché <UNK> i didn't care for the white trash characters who came in contact with the gun and the depiction of the minority characters should have the <UNK> crying foul immediately all these people would chase after a gun because they are at the bottom of the societal trash heap and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soul searching on the part of the characters br br the biggest problem is the promise <UNK> the plot outline was great in the hands of a p t anderson or gus van <UNK> it could have been a powerful piece but due either to bad screenplay direction or both the thing is an <UNK> mess that needs to be ignored at all costs br br my bigger question is who at the thought this was competition material better bury this on showtime at <UNK> br br art
<START> the first few minutes showing the cold and <UNK> the willis character were pretty enjoyable especially with jean smart but it really <UNK> after that this is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no <UNK> at all i know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that willis was just as irritating in his younger self but i found this kid especially irritating and
<START> once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the <UNK> work has been fully restored and we see this old time <UNK> store on a street corner with the snow gently falling inside are the rich colors of all the <UNK> from produce to <UNK> and <UNK> goods to medicine to candy etc br br in essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the <UNK> of items or a pie or even a pack of <UNK> br br the whole show is narrated by jack bunny a jack benny <UNK> with music from conductor leopold who was in so many looney tunes animated shorts i have lost count a lot of the humor is <UNK> so it pays to know who little egypt and other characters the busby berkeley type <UNK> number with bathing suited coming out of the can and the <UNK> can can dance were both clever br br all of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longer than normal length cartoon the second half was about a king kong type which escapes from the animal <UNK> box and <UNK> everyone that part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note so an a for the first half a d for the second making it about a c plus or b minus overall
<START> this is a fine concept piece and the acting by brando is a fine piece of work dean martin isn't bad and <UNK> <UNK> is quite good as well unfortunately it's a very disjointed very long piece that really should have been edited down to something closer to 2 hours it's almost 3 hours br br we follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 through the end of wwii and watch as they discover who they are and what they might become as they discover both the world about them and what they're made of for some it's the women in their lives that brings about this realization for others it's the <UNK> general circumstances all too often however i found myself asking what had just happened or what the <UNK> of a particular scene was
<START> this movie is about carlos the quinn an international terrorist who by cia agent henry sutherland description appears to women and children for the heck of it at least that's what he says to guilt us naval officer <UNK> quinn again into taking on the assignment of posing as carlos and setting him up as a <UNK> in the eyes of the <UNK> <UNK> is apparently physically identical to carlos but mentally he is his <UNK> he is <UNK> of order and carlos is <UNK> of chaos br br the movie isn't all shoot gun jump around action and that's a good thing in its first half <UNK> <UNK> training to act and think like carlos and that's actually where the movie achieves its distinction from other run of the mill action flicks an israeli agent kingsley joins fields in training <UNK> and together they appear to take on the roles of parents in the <UNK> of new character <UNK> is taught to dislike the things carlos <UNK> to act on the split second like carlos would and even to make love like carlos courtesy of an ex girlfriend of naturally all that he is taught would be put to good use in the later half of the movie it's a little contrived but quinn gives a riveting performance as a carlos wannabe br br another thing i liked about this movie was that it didn't <UNK> the much overdone plot point in evil twin movies you know the one in which the evil twin <UNK> himself into the good <UNK> family family does come into the picture but instead they highlight how his new character <UNK> havoc on his family life br br good chuckle humor is <UNK> into this movie often coming the <UNK> duo of sutherland and kingsley an exception is the <UNK> and apparently gratuitous joke involving first name <UNK> get it also overdone was the constant <UNK> by the duo about how powerful and cunning and intelligent carlos is in my opinion during the final showdown the payoff wasn't able to match the build up br br on the whole the movie was enjoyable i'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and engrossing than the average action movie and it <UNK> my attention throughout br br my rating 9 10
<START> since i am a fan of natalie portman i had to see the movie i enjoyed every minute of it it plays out in a very sincere way throughout the whole movie at seemed as if natalie was the mother and susan was the mother <UNK> character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it br br i heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving natalie and some guy he's in outside <UNK> but natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed and i think that is great i think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film br br natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because i haven't seen her in a bad film yet so any movie that has natalie portman will no doubt be seen by me br br a good film 7 10
<START> this is a bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of <UNK> several <UNK> scripts as a result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr huston should have been proud of making however the film is worth watching if you are a fan of pre code films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out even if they aren't married and even if their partner is br br the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker <UNK> troops heading to europe for wwi in the process she meets a bruce <UNK> who eventually convinces her to sleep with him she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne does not want him back as she realizes he's not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth while all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always <UNK> to almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time br br surprisingly this entire plot involving a <UNK> baby and <UNK> ends about 1 4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or <UNK> to it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women's prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to <UNK> and as a result of all this violence miss dunne goes on a <UNK> to clean up the prison and becomes a <UNK> and famous writer br br but then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the women's prison <UNK> business goes by the <UNK> dunne meets a judge walter huston who is married but he desperately wants her now throughout the film dunne is portrayed as a very good girl even though she did have <UNK> sex with <UNK> she was more or less tricked into it but now single irene who is a <UNK> <UNK> and good lady begins sleeping with a married man he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his <UNK> off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business but while she's pregnant with his love child he's <UNK> for being a crooked judge he <UNK> her he's innocent but he's convicted and it sure sounds like he's a <UNK> using inside information from people that have come before his <UNK> in order to a fortune then in the final moments of the film miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and <UNK> to wait with the child until huston is released the film then ends br br so we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like i gathered that she should be a strong minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships this really <UNK> all the <UNK> about <UNK> character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film a strong women's rights <UNK> might easily be offended at how weak minded and <UNK> she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect with a decent re write this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a <UNK> and <UNK> film but it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre code film
<START> margaret mitchell <UNK> in her grave every time somebody watches this mess fine <UNK> and sets can't even begin to <UNK> lackluster performances by <UNK> <UNK> as the title character and the ever bland timothy dalton as <UNK> even worse than the acting and perhaps partially explaining it is the script which is <UNK> cliched and predictable add to that <UNK> bad script a score that'll have you cringing and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer scarlett is just amazingly lousy and i can't imagine how it ever got made much less made it to video
<START> <UNK> during my <UNK> into foreign cinema i have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror action drama comedy and romance to name a few thus i have enjoyed the thoughtful serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless popcorn fun of action films with a wide array of chinese japanese and korean movies under my belt i am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> of time has nothing to recognize it is one of the worst chinese movies i have ever seen br br to start off this overrated <UNK> epic showcases the infamous <UNK> action sequence throughout which is nothing more than an ultra cheap and pathetic form of action choreography one simply needs to show a series of close up pictures of faces swords legs and or arms and then a dead body you now have an action sequence for <UNK> of time the problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on br br the dramatic element of this film is nonexistent as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen which <UNK> all characters generic and <UNK> leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions in fact the storyline itself is an absolute disaster introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices plot <UNK> in films can be used very i e a tale of two sisters but <UNK> of time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than <UNK> a very simple plot for no apparently good reason br br in fact this entire movie acts like a series of to cover up its <UNK> horrible action choreography is covered up by <UNK> tricks and chaotic camera movements non existent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel and a <UNK> storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with br br as if this weren't bad enough this movie was extremely boring seeming more like 150 minutes instead of the actual 95 br br rating a rarely given 0 5 stars
<START> being a fan of bad movies i was thrilled to find a 3 pack of <UNK> <UNK> horror at best buy today the set was cheap and included a terrible film called the dark that i actually remember seeing in the theater br br the remaining 2 were equally as bad creatures from the <UNK> being probably the worst of the bunch since they were all bad that isn't saying much but its stupidity bad acting terrible effects and retarded storyline actually made this one a lot of fun to watch i was rolling on the floor with each new plot development the discovery of the abandon ship the missing crew the realization that there was something terribly wrong it was great of course everyone's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene <UNK> i almost lost it between that an the monster <UNK> i have to say i enjoyed this film a lot br br i am a fan of bad movies so i enjoyed it but in all fairness i did have to give the movie a 1 it was awful but if rubbish is your bag at least rent this one yes the bad pun was intentional
<START> didn't the writer for this movie see the other three i loved the original i thought 2 was the best i <UNK> 3 it was ok nothing special but i hated this one who dare they kill off <UNK> this was certainly not the <UNK> who had been almost like a brother to charlie in number 2 remember his speech charlie said you wouldn't just leave me on earth would you <UNK> <UNK> charlie bounty hunter saying that he was now one of them now how dare the writers ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a baddie who <UNK> killed by charlie in a particularly awkward scene just because they realized the movie was getting boring in fact for the first 20 minutes we get a new cast and have to wait this long until we again find out what happened to charlie who was the hero we've been waiting to see i kept waiting saying come on <UNK> charlie going to appear angela <UNK> must be doing her best to deny she was ever in this turkey moving it to the future <UNK> the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time i think the writers decided that their movie was going to be the last and they could do whatever they wanted this movie is totally out of line with the first two and it didn't even seem like it was written by the same people who made 3 3 at least had humor and could easily be seen by younger children 4 is just ugly and mean spirited eric dare is particularly cruel and unnecessary i hated this movie hated hated hated it i hated the fact that anyone could like it and i hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics i give this a one start simply because imdb com won't let me give it a zero
<START> the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly <UNK> moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br one of the most hilarious three stooges shorts is men in black in this short are bud <UNK> roberts <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> henderson <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> billy gilbert and ruth the acting by these actors are good especially by and roberts there are many funny scenes here that i think most three stooges fans will love in my opinion this one of the most different three stooges shorts i recommend this one to all
<START> br br as a fan of bad movies and mst3k and a member of i must say i've seen my share of them but <UNK> even the worst i've seen at least had a soundtrack as george <UNK> wanders around hong kong doing who knows what you can guarantee that you won't be distracted by any of that background music that fills todays cinema or any of that music that fills <UNK> i don't think anyone in this film even <UNK> br br now this isn't entirely true there is a sound track if you listen closely you will hear it <UNK> in about a half dozen times through the course of the film of course the timing will be entirely inappropriate and it doesn't last very long but something that could be classified as music does occur your best bet though is to sit your <UNK> armed with a wooden <UNK> down in front of the tv with a collection of <UNK> and pans while you watch the rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers br br keep an eye out for sammo hung as a minor <UNK> in this film aren't we all glad he found jackie chan to work with
<START> i agree with this is a great movie here are some dialogue snippets br br sean connery to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you see the man at the well how he draws the water when one bucket <UNK> the other fills it is so with the world at present you are full of power but you're <UNK> it and islam is <UNK> up the drops as they <UNK> from your bucket br br the english have paid very well in the past well you'll not have your way with the americans president <UNK> will have your head for this <UNK> this president <UNK> he would try and take it himself he certainly would he is a man of <UNK> and strong moral <UNK> he does not kidnap women and children what kind of rifle does he use a winchester winchester winchester i have no knowledge of this rifle you will br br teddy <UNK> brian keith the american <UNK> bear is a symbol of the american character strength intelligence <UNK> a little blind and reckless at times but courageous beyond all doubt oh and one other <UNK> goes with all previous newspaper reporter and that mr president teddy <UNK> loneliness the bear lives out his life alone <UNK> but always alone he has no real allies only enemies but none of them are as great as he newspaper reporter you feel this might be an american <UNK> teddy <UNK> certainly the world would never love us it may respect us it may even grow to fear us but it'll never love us for we have too much <UNK> and we're a bit blind and reckless at times too
<START> humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of the boy seemed to enjoy it more than i did i found it an <UNK> affair more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s the boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between lucy bell and nick while i found laughs thin on the ground if you want to spend your money on this wait until it's on video
<START> low budget but memorable would be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre vulnerable naive nurse charlotte <UNK> comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered despite the red <UNK> that are constantly being raised all around her br br the lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style as well as a cast of wacky characters the pleasures of this film don't come from the film's shocks which are fairly tame but from the weird atmosphere first we have the <UNK> woman who thinks her baby doll is real there's also an axe murdering judge a shell shocked war veteran and old mrs callahan is like everybody's <UNK> elderly grandmother gone amok a young patient named <UNK> gives the term <UNK> new meaning a big guy named sam is just a little slow after a <UNK> <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> suddenly between <UNK> and violent <UNK> the only other <UNK> person in the place seems to be dr masters but does she have a secret br br don't look in the basement is a great example of low budget exploitation films there isn't much plot going on but the <UNK> works for the movie several cast members turn in memorable performances particularly betty chandler and <UNK> and the way the director adds little weird details to the movie can really stick with you br br the scene between <UNK> and the <UNK> man is a classic for all time and especially delicious are the facial expressions of dr masters when she begins to go over the edge near the finale of the movie also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack with several musical <UNK> really <UNK> the characters that they <UNK> my favorite cue is the crazy cue a that whenever one of the patients does something <UNK> br br also wonderful is the way that charlotte herself <UNK> into <UNK> at the climax with the patients revealing that dr masters is simply another <UNK> and then suggesting that charlotte is also a patient who is being allowed to act out her <UNK> she certainly has a <UNK> grip on reality why else would she not question the ominous lack of phone service or outside contact the scene where charlotte manages to finish off the barely alive dr <UNK> with a toy boat has to be one of the greatest moments in low budget horror yes don't look in the basement could very well be the american beauty of grade z trash
<START> this movie had potential the script was not bad and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide <UNK> regrets and as chris says 10 years of going nowhere it's a sharp contrast to the original which was bright humorous and even the bad guy was lovable br br it's a very interesting change of tone and if they had developed the characters more maybe i would've liked it br br but instead they waste far too much time on gratuitous and ridiculous battle scenes poorly edited together at one point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again but not many people would notice that since there are already 2 dozen horse <UNK> i'm not <UNK> and by then we've already <UNK> off br br which leads me to the title of my review this film was <UNK> cut due to animal cruelty so chances are if you decide to watch it you'll get the watered down kiddie version there's a <UNK> where the <UNK> stabs the bull and suddenly as the crowd <UNK> cheering there's no bull just the <UNK> in an empty <UNK> like wow maybe the bull was a jedi i <UNK> more likely the scene was cut br br later there's a <UNK> scene where in the original version one of the birds gets horribly <UNK> before a crowd of cheering <UNK> this was cut but we still see enough to get pretty annoyed br br but by far the worst scenes are the horse throws one after the other you see <UNK> legs get <UNK> sending thousands of pounds of horse onto its head in one scene a horse gets thrown and then while it's <UNK> on the ground in <UNK> <UNK> an explosive goes off right under its neck br br this film was made in 1966 when hollywood was just starting to animal brutality on film this is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen so if that sort of stuff it <UNK> <UNK> boat check it out you'll get a mild thrill but if not you'll either be irritated or flat out bored
<START> the comments for <UNK> make it sound like a very interesting film one that i would be deeply interested in unfortunately the producers didn't see fit to include closed <UNK> for the hearing <UNK> and deaf that leaves me and countless others like me who depend on closed <UNK> to follow a movie completely out br br this is <UNK> for any film produced in the year 2005 in a world where all manner of <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> it's <UNK> and ironic that the ever <UNK> entertainment industry fails to demand that all productions and movie theaters be closed <UNK>
<START> it's a soap opera drawing upon an applied <UNK> idea a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie i didn't get any emotion from it the ideas are not at all new the tension lacks it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a <UNK> way i mean you have this middle aged <UNK> bald guy who gets more women than don juan he doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely <UNK> for over 28 years he has no issues with god and one would probably expect that too the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves i can't get out of my mind <UNK> cries and <UNK> similar to this one in many respects which simply bursts with emotions and not all of them <UNK> etc this movie is the perfect recipe for <UNK> who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern <UNK> issue without any desire to <UNK> the viewer <UNK> doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded
<START> david lynch shot his first film over several years adding new scenes each time he managed to raise a little bit more cash kevin smith made <UNK> at work while working as a clerk and robert rodriguez has <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> till <UNK> cost precisely 30 000 but 30 000 is still a hell of a lot of money to raise if you work as a <UNK> in a cemetery and what if an aspiring film maker not only had such a job but also had all the ambition of such <UNK> and all the of smith but absolutely none of the talent such a figure is mark the subject of this hilarious documentary which chronicles his attempt to make a pair of movies over many many years combines his lunatic dreams with <UNK> of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day one senses he almost prefers the endless <UNK> of searching for an impossible perfection to an <UNK> with the reality that he's simply on the evidence presented in <UNK> <UNK> not very good and like a modern day ed wood he <UNK> himself with an epic crowd of fellow losers his genuine affection for whom is his greatest redeeming feature the collection includes his <UNK> parents his best friends one a criminal the other a <UNK> drug addict his own hapless children and best of all his aged uncle bill bill may live in a trailer park and just about have given up on life but he is the owner of a small fortune <UNK> 000 to be precise and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the film manages to <UNK> a few actors to perform alongside himself of course but in the main he is wholly <UNK> on friends and family to complete his work even bill has a role on camera on british tv the bbc brilliantly <UNK> a screening of <UNK> <UNK> back to back with <UNK> in la the story of terry <UNK> ill <UNK> attempt to film <UNK> <UNK> in that film one was impressed by the huge amount of <UNK> on display <UNK> as it was to the task in hand and just how damn difficult it is even for experts with millions to spend to make a film whereas is not only <UNK> but also such a clown that he can't even <UNK> the name of his own work properly ultimately is human enough for you to want him to succeed but awful enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures if this film was fiction you'd dismiss it as unbelievable but as it is it's one of the funniest documentaries you're likely to see
<START> i really enjoyed this old black and white <UNK> at first i didn't recognize harold lloyd as mr <UNK> a <UNK> to china coming home to find a wife there were many twists and turns in mr attempts to clean up city hall his methods of making the punishment fit the crime would likely be illegal but this is not a movie based on reality this would be a perfect movie for children except that there is female near nudity only on grace <UNK> the old <UNK> are enchanting the only fault is a problem typical of the day <UNK> are used to represent chinese men this is <UNK> by the positive way the chinese are portrayed they are the wise good and friendly guys trivia a truck appears in the movie when the police run out of black
<START> this movie just felt very true to life i liked the ending which seemed to resolve naturally without any big moments but with a lot of little moments coming together you could tell it is an honest love story it doesn't matter what the of the main characters are it still a story about love and understanding br br there were a lot of scenes that involved the family the setting is during what for some people is a very <UNK> time namely the holidays christmas to be precise br br like most good films this one <UNK> issues of love fitting in expectations and can't be overcome <UNK> in the end alexandra and <UNK> make a choice for each other knowing that love is difficult and about giving well done
<START> this is really a terrible film by any of the regular plot storyline acting effects direction i could go on suffice to say it's poor however it has a certain appeal many totally out of context sex scenes appear it's fun looking for the batman references <UNK> that's it poor really don't bother
<START> a study of one of those universally familiar physical and or emotional states isolation i think the film also comments on cultural <UNK> too br br the film presents the experiences of two turkish men cousins one has money and the <UNK> that come of having <UNK> <UNK> with a steady <UNK> the other has none and goes in search of work neither are happy expect no celebration of life here this is loneliness <UNK> and all br br the film succeeds in offering a <UNK> bleak <UNK> across the <UNK> of the human condition brave film making well acted and well shot in my view <UNK> shots by the <UNK> being my own favourites a film that should inspire <UNK> in anyone who is not a stranger to happiness and <UNK> in life not to mention <UNK> everyone else will find a companion in this film a film with all the warmth and pace of an ice expect a bitter <UNK> not a <UNK> <UNK> '
<START> though the video technology may be dated this classic musical play now on dvd is the best version of <UNK> most important and polished work on broadway if you've never seen <UNK> todd then you must buy this dvd i saw this production in november 1980 at kennedy center in washington and fell in love with a pre murder she wrote angela lansbury subsequently i tried to find any and all of her work among them movies the harvey girls the picture of <UNK> gray <UNK> candidate <UNK> <UNK> dear world and gypsy and many more the rest of the cast is flawless too all in all this wonderful dvd gives us the definitive version of <UNK> opera
<START> although i had previously watched this one some time ago on italian tv i found it to be a surprisingly tolerable <UNK> this time round <UNK> by an international cast of familiar faces including a <UNK> joseph <UNK> as the baron and contrary to many another film of the euro cult sub genre an incident packed plot in place of <UNK> pacing br br the creature itself looks a bit dodgy and <UNK> is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist still <UNK> in creating life forms out of corpses one would have thought that he would have made himself an army of them by now and not struggling at <UNK> his technique still but ms <UNK> does look good in and out of costume and reliable herbert probably comes off best as a <UNK> grave <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is the worst of the <UNK> series by far the acting in tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time the major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original like there's a different girl friend of in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick why is this film made like a disney movie after about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all there's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to <UNK> after the films 20 minutes are up the film is entertainment h ll it's watchable well unless your drunk then don't watch this film you've been warned
<START> according to this masterpiece of film script pun intended charles <UNK> was full of nonsense when he presented his evolution theory because he made absolutely no mention of any alien <UNK> for you see aliens sent to the earth and they form the missing link in the evolution theory however the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that are a typically puerto <UNK> phenomenon so i don't really know where that fits in are they saying all puerto <UNK> are aliens whatever it's all pretty irrelevant anyway the only thing you need to <UNK> is that el is an utterly cheap and <UNK> amateur b movie lacking tension character development and any form of style several <UNK> of people are chasing this goat <UNK> monster remotely resembling the midget version of the <UNK> demon through the streets and <UNK> of an ugly city we have an <UNK> and a <UNK> female novelist a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim witted <UNK> since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do the monster can <UNK> carry on <UNK> all the latino immigrants of the neighborhood the monster itself looks okay and the make up effects on his <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> gross and bloody the acting performances are <UNK> awful and headache inducing particularly eric <UNK> is <UNK> in his first and only lead role as the overly ambitious employee of animal control yes it's an incredibly stupid film but surely you have <UNK> yourself through worse and less amusing low budget garbage
<START> this movie is specially for children and i think they will enjoy the movie for older than 10 the movie is not great but <UNK> <UNK> played very well and without her the movie is very bad but now it gets a 7
<START> i saw this film in a sneak preview and it is delightful the cinematography is unusually creative the acting is good and the story is fabulous if this movie does not do well it won't be because it doesn't deserve to before this film i didn't realize how charming <UNK> <UNK> could be he does a marvelous self contained job as the lead there's something incredibly sweet about him and it makes the movie even better the other actors do a good job as well and the film contains moments of really high suspense more than one might expect from a movie about golf sports movies are a dime a dozen but this one stands out br br this is one i'd recommend to anyone
<START> this movie was <UNK> <UNK> and everything in it was bland the acting the plot etc it was such a disappointment since the description looked so good do not be fooled this movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it
<START> ah yes it's yet another retelling of the classic <UNK> murderous doctor creates female frankenstein and falls in love br br from the same director who brought you such timeless classics as 10 000 <UNK> no not the group and blood feast this unfinished film virtually cries out for the mst3k treatment the doctor's assistant even has overtones of from the classic <UNK> the hands of fate i don't know if the graphic if fake looking violence or the frequent stretches of dialogue free tedium could have scared the crew off though br br the main reasons to bother sitting through this movie are for the hysterical scene the laughably serious ending and the rock bottom production values i actually watched all of the credits after this movie for the same reasons you're inclined to slow down your car when you pass a serious traffic accident that and the sheer genius of the end theme that sounds like a watered down my favorite things played on a toy piano <UNK> this ain't
<START> i absolutely loved this movie great realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching genuine story also the calm understated manner of the lead character makes him very likable the human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time the bond between and <UNK> shows the loyalty wartime <UNK> can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans the subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to <UNK> the problems the czech pilots had in the <UNK> the <UNK> storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of ww2 did not end in 1945 especially in russian occupied countries the cinematography was also very good wish i could have seen it on the big screen
<START> growing up in the late 60s and 70s i could not help but become a fan of science fiction with america's space program in top gear sci fi books movies tv shows and comic books <UNK> my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe <UNK> is so unlike any other sci fi show yet it has all the ingredients that made shows like star trek battlestar x files and deep space nine personal favorites one of the criticisms of <UNK> is that the casual viewer can't just jump in and watch one episode and understand what is going on there have been other very successful shows that used multiple episode story <UNK> and complicated characters this for me is one of the charms of the show i don't need or want to have the story all tied up neatly at the end of every episode like the various <UNK> of star trek have done all in all <UNK> has wonderful and funny characters and a running storyline that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe they still have unique qualities and abilities br br unfortunately the <UNK> people at the sci fi channel have canceled <UNK> season they have stated that the <UNK> was based on <UNK> ratings yet just a few years ago it was their top rated original series and a critical favorite it's a shame that all of the artists who help create this show will be unable to continue their labor of love because of the <UNK> problems of the very channel company that made it all possible in the first place br br hey don't take my word for it watch the show watch the re runs and make up your own mind help save <UNK>
<START> a widely unknown strange little western with <UNK> colours probably the same material as it was used in johnny guitar i guess or something which makes blood <UNK> look like shining nearly <UNK> scenes with twisted action and characters something different far from being a masterpiece but there should be paid more attention to this little gem in western <UNK>
<START> the evil gang in this movie were called the <UNK> hence the title but minor would have been a better name for this sorry mob of weak actors trying to look dangerous whenever they wanted to kill someone they <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> very slowly so that their intended victim could easily avoid them or push them off their <UNK> their leader had a bad limp but still thought he could take on the hero and win as for karen black she didn't seem to know where she was for most of the film
<START> the greatest game ever played 2005 is an amazingly uplifting <UNK> underdog film that never really <UNK> into <UNK> or yes it takes several liberties as most hollywood films do but those liberties are forgiven as they actually add to the film's enjoyment not detract from it in fact there are a lot of truthful moments in it you can really tell that it's a rocky type film from the film's outset but who cares directed by none other than bill paxton i know right it's expertly done and immensely watchable br br tells the story of francis played with confidence <UNK> and class by superstar to be <UNK> <UNK> an amateur <UNK> from a working class irish french immigrant family living in ma in the early <UNK> qualifies to play in the <UNK> u s open included amongst his competition is the legendary harry played with immense class dignity and <UNK> by stephen ironically is the 2nd underdog in this flick the film starts in <UNK> scotland where land <UNK> tell the <UNK> that they are building a golf course on his home and that golf is a game not for the likes of someone like him francis <UNK> some of the same prejudice as a boy in early <UNK> the stories <UNK> at the <UNK> open br br what's ironic is that even as an adult and multiple major champion is still an <UNK> in british society due to his upbringing francis learned much about golf from reading books on the subject and is his idol all growing up <UNK> to they actually met back in <UNK> in boston after who won that year's open was <UNK> when francis was only 7 br br in addition to francis and in the <UNK> open include friend and champion brit ted ray <UNK> stephen marcus and <UNK> chest <UNK> two time defending champion john mcdermott michael weaver the film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men br br <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and stunning as <UNK> supportive irish mum and veteran <UNK> <UNK> gives a stern reserved <UNK> performance as his french dad <UNK> young josh <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> sized 10 year old <UNK> eddie almost single <UNK> steals the proceedings br br paxton throws in a lot of modern details such as special effects <UNK> in shots to show the <UNK> of the players and cgi for a lot of the golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a <UNK> pace so as not to make the film too much of a period piece but the film still convinces us of a specific time and place br br what's interesting is that while rocky like this is all based on a true story so the ending is satisfactory on so many levels an entertaining film about golf set in the early <UNK> wow
<START> well folks this is another <UNK> of gay life however the additional downside includes poor acting horrible script no budget terrible sound and let us not forget the impossible storyline br br it is christmas in new york city and our story <UNK> focuses on two male individuals apparently lovers for some time one of them has not let his parents the right wing religious <UNK> types know that he is gay adding to the of the story 'cause this guy is as as gay guys come these days and his parents are coming to him they will stay in his new york apartment where he and his lover have just <UNK> for christmas br br the story continues to develop around the arrival of the parents who <UNK> will like anyway and how through only obvious and predictable ways they come to learn there son is gay tears are shed as was my interest in this movie br br the cast of <UNK> seemed like an intro acting course at the local community theatre the lovers in this film are <UNK> and there does not appear to be any <UNK> to their union br br the <UNK> is flat and her attempt to be <UNK> in the situation are <UNK> and certainly didnt help move the plot any further br br the friend who steps to the aid of one of the lovers in his time of need is <UNK> and gives a bad name to the unique art of drag br br although some guys night find one of the lovers to have a nice body again <UNK> imagery it does not help this story br br stay away from this film especially if you are considering a purchase you'll shoot yourself if you do
<START> this film has a brilliant soundtrack and superb acting from some pretty unknown faces i especially like the <UNK> bad boy characters in it who <UNK> around like american <UNK> acting tough the banter between <UNK> and is brilliant they come across as being best mates almost as if it were true in real life i have experienced some of the things in this film and let me tell you first hand these folks ain't acting especially the seen with <UNK> and talking and <UNK> coke danny <UNK> is priceless as the <UNK> dealer and has the funniest lines in the film br br i'm <UNK> when i'm off my <UNK> feeling the music you get me i knew you wouldn't let me down i knew it
<START> extremely good cinematic story of gay <UNK> former teen star now waiting tables the sexual <UNK> are explored here realistically and with an actual human face this and throw in a serial killer on the loose and you have love and the human remains a well portrayed drama a strange sense of humor and a mystery the screenplay is fluid and believable the performances are well above average and the twists in the story are sharp br br this certainly isn't everyone's ideal notion of a movie but for those who appreciate something different and <UNK> written it's very much worthy of your time highly recommended
<START> i don't remember too much about this movie except that there was a distinctly gratuitous destruction of <UNK> almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and <UNK> destruction of useful light <UNK> even if <UNK> with cheesy <UNK> style shades to keep with the time setting of the story on one occasion <UNK> <UNK> destruction takes place in a domestic fight scene between the brothers in both the living and <UNK> rooms of their mother's house with <UNK> in both rooms being taken out yet the most <UNK> destruction occurs moments later in a office and includes but is not limited to the <UNK> of a <UNK> with a <UNK> horse head base which is consequently <UNK> and the severe <UNK> of a <UNK> as a guy falls back into it during another <UNK> fight later that <UNK> is <UNK> as well when the guy is shot <UNK> further damage to the plastic <UNK> <UNK> br br while this movie encourages a particularly <UNK> attitude toward <UNK> one should keep in mind that <UNK> regardless of their cheap construction or <UNK> top heavy appearance are still valuable for the <UNK> that they provide however if you ever feel the need to <UNK> smash a <UNK> i would highly recommend this movie
<START> this film is the greatest ninja film ever made in my opinion and if you haven't seen it then its worth watching i would rate this film a 10 10 if you want to see more then check out http uk <UNK> com the opening sequence where the evil ninja is killing everyone in his way is excellent his character is the best he then has to possesses woman who finds him dying she then has to take revenge on the cops that killed him which means there's more killing and action but only a ninja can destroy a ninja so she and her boyfriend who is also one of her targets <UNK> the help of sho <UNK> to release the evil ninjas spirit and destroy him
<START> never mind the serious logic gaps never mind the <UNK> cliche character portrayals never mind the <UNK> writing and you might like this movie the main character <UNK> was supposed to be endearing the heroine who you root for to be saved or in this case save herself but instead she merely <UNK> and makes one wonder are all pro really that stupid her <UNK> mother was obviously only necessary to further <UNK> the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor innocent young girl from your grasp with an ever present biting artistic director villain and the <UNK> not only does she become <UNK> an over the counter <UNK> and a <UNK> liar but all in the course of a few months it's like the writer read every horror story he could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much he could <UNK> into two hours with commercials br br believe it or not but i am a dancer this <UNK> or <UNK> of <UNK> and that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools i have attended in fact the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered <UNK> overweight i'm not saying eating <UNK> never occur but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movie br br another annoying problem this movie had was the means to an end writing style her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time all in the first half the other supporting characters were merely props <UNK> to further the story given the right dialogue this would have been a very intricate mind study of a problem as it is it turns into a one woman show and <UNK> <UNK> doesn't have the <UNK> to pull it off br br to a non dancer this movie would be a supposed insight into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company to a dancer this is a very insulting movie which portrays as stupid and parents as <UNK> and ill informed those <UNK> more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place 3 10
<START> blind date columbia pictures 1934 was a decent film but i have a few issues with this film first of all i don't fault the actors in this film at all but more or less i have a problem with the script also i understand that this film was made in the 1930's and people were looking to escape reality but the script made ann character look weak she kept going back and forth between <UNK> and i felt as though she should have stayed with paul kelly's character in the end he truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to <UNK> neil hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time paul kelly's character although a <UNK> was a man of integrity and truly loved kitty ann <UNK> as opposed to neil hamilton while he did like her a lot i didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character the production values were great but the script could have used a little work
<START> somebody decided to make a black version of airplane br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all of its time insulting the intelligence of the audience and the cast br br this movie managed to <UNK> the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time if nothing else it deserves to be remembered for that accomplishment br br it's not a black thing it's not a white thing it's just a bad thing a really really bad thing picking it apart point by point would be a waste of time the best thing that can be said about the movie is that there was a purple airplane in it do yourself a favor go buy a picture of a purple airplane and you will have gotten the best of what this movie had to offer br br this one definitely goes under the category of what the were they thinking
<START> at the <UNK> core was on television yesterday i was at my computer working and happened to glance over and see what must have been some of the worst action sequences ever made i was instantly enthralled by the film's shoddy production values appalling acting by all included even peter cushing and horrific unintentionally hilarious action sequences and puppet monsters br br the film is about a victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical buff american hero on a ground boring trip in the <UNK> countryside little do they know that a great evil <UNK> at the center of the <UNK> core br br forget the fact that the title doesn't make sense if they were really at the <UNK> core they'd be about underground and burning alive in a sea of iron or whatever it is down there forget that the puppets used in the production rival the beast master for being the <UNK> looking of all time no the real genius of at the <UNK> core is its naive stupidity a <UNK> ho action spectacle without real action and without real spectacle it is in essence just a <UNK> ho movie and a stupid one at that people who enjoy mst3k style stuff will love this it's <UNK> bad and indeed so bad it is almost enjoyable in a strange way

<START> i watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster it is officially the only movie that i've wanted to <UNK> watching let me start off by saying that i like b movies i consider ice pirates one of the best comedies ever i'll also note that i'm a writer and that i've met the director writer of this cinematic marvel br br <UNK> the acting if i was going to pick a bright spot i'd have to point out that <UNK> day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this for those who don't know <UNK> is a boxer not an actor so we'll forgive him his lame death sequence why doesn't he fire the shotgun he's holding once budget to highlight the bad acting would take pages so i'll stick to the <UNK> lead which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded cool has maximum face time in this movie probably because he was a producer his looks are completely fine but his delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on soap operas i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him but part of the blame is definitely his br br special effects not my <UNK> but for a low budget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable it didn't bother me but it also didn't impress br br writing directing oscar for best screenplay is not something i can <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ever winning not only is the plot <UNK> but the dialog is flat and stilted i understand stylized <UNK> but this was just bad writing the thing that bothered me most was the <UNK> <UNK> stole scenes shots and facial hair from a slew of other movies the scene where <UNK> crow is walking through the <UNK> field in gladiator entire sequences from the good the bad and the ugly that sort of thing just doesn't cut it with me i'll choose not to comment on the shooting because i don't know what it takes to establish a good shot etc br br conclusion don't rent this movie don't even pirate it it's far too bad to waste any time on the good reviews may be entirely bogus after meeting <UNK> it seems more then likely that he is <UNK> them himself
<START> sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase i don't know what i was thinking but i really couldn't help myself br br i've been meaning to see <UNK> for a long time and i must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price and believe me i live in a small south american village and these things are very unlikely to happen it's a real shame that some of these from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten <UNK> is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays not a masterpiece for sure but still entertaining and guess what it doesn't really have unintentionally funny scenes i know it's a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people but trust me the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part br br in <UNK> the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total <UNK> according to during <UNK> the sun and the moon block <UNK> which controls emotions as a consequence the three children who are born that day eventually become <UNK> and evil since they don't experience any feelings of <UNK> whatsoever these 10 year old kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way including their own parents and siblings and kill them the body count <UNK> day after day and the police authorities believe that there's a psychopath lurking around the place in the meantime debbie curtis and steven don't hesitate to keep <UNK> people since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces br br like i was saying before <UNK> is surprisingly not funny i know i said that before but i'm truly surprised by this i was expecting some hilariously bad scenes but the movie proved me wrong true it's not exactly what most people would consider a horror movie but if i have to be fair i'd say that the story is <UNK> executed one of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations like i did it's because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable let's face it kids tend to be horrible actors which is understandable and we can't blame them for that but to my surprise the three young actors who played the <UNK> killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny the rest of the actors are also good and if you're a george clooney fan you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie yeah i know right who cares also julie brown the great actress singer <UNK> and gay icon gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity she also <UNK> in one of the scenes and she looks great naked too bad she didn't have more time on the screen though julie is p br br so basically this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s my only <UNK> regarding <UNK> would be the way to justify the children's motives this is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film let's see if children who were born during an <UNK> end up being heartless killers then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people i'm sure there were other children who had been born the same day and during other days of total <UNK> too oh well overall no big deal it's just a simple observation that's all i've seen worse trust me take 'the <UNK> 1980 for example in which the <UNK> killer get their <UNK> after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud no believe me <UNK> is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers you're going to enjoy this one very much br br so now you know you're invited to the children's birthday party and the <UNK> will be serving a delicious <UNK> cake for you and the rest of the guests come on you can't miss it
<START> i love the absurdity and biting humor of <UNK> films such as the <UNK> charm of the <UNK> and the <UNK> angel to name two other earlier works like the forgotten ones about juvenile <UNK> from a <UNK> neighborhood in mexico are more serious and provide a strong social message br br however i believe it is which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer while it's true that it's <UNK> with irony it nevertheless reveals an aspect of <UNK> which would appear to be intrigued by the beauty and <UNK> of the spiritual quest here while the director quite typically throws countless <UNK> at the catholic church he also appears to show surprisingly a sense of admiration for genuine christian thought and its practice of <UNK> love br br what luis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a jesus like figure i always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue that is until i watched my appreciation is that he <UNK> exposes the difficulty of following <UNK> example in a society <UNK> with <UNK> ignorance and sin but he also presents the hero father as quite the <UNK> of light amidst a sea of darkness without a doubt by the end of the film i was looking up to him and not down on him br br some would argue that father doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his <UNK> values alas if he can't do good in this world who can but i would say that this flaw his frustration precisely makes his character all the more heroic because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be and who says the priest couldn't eventually emerge from that dark night and regain his confidence perhaps we've only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey the elegant open ending in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a female stranger allows us to imagine ourselves the final outcome of the story br br i recognize in <UNK> the aggressive self <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with brilliant wit and social consciousness but after having watched i also sense from him a certain warmth a depth and maturity that's not so evident in his other work br br for the sake of contrast i strongly recommend watching afterward his short film simon of the desert also made in mexico several years later it deals with a similar subject matter the <UNK> of the ego in the face of temptation only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally <UNK> style
<START> my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger it's about andre a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter <UNK> <UNK> on a vacation hoping to get a little closer to her but of course nicole isn't that easy to get along with she just started <UNK> i'm guessing she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time one day at the beach nicole meets handsome ben and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie i would give my father the hero 8 10
<START> i am <UNK> that so many people find this film even close to good let me make it clear that i am a huge hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as i could but this one i felt was so below par not only for <UNK> films <UNK> heck i'm being far too nice here this <UNK> really sucked i don't care that <UNK> did a favor for the very talented carole lombard but i have seen 50s sitcoms with more <UNK> and style than this boring turkey chemistry between lombard and robert <UNK> i like <UNK> <UNK> and ice cream but i wouldn't want to taste them together i have seen better chemistry in chemical <UNK> on <UNK> highway than here br br if you really love hitchcock avoid this film and see any one of his better ones for crying out loud the bits <UNK> did on the old tv show were funnier than anything this film fails miserably to deliver
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> gives its audience a look into the mind of a man who thinks he's found himself only to find out that he's not so sure he found the right guy if you think that all gay comedies are the same check this one out although the movie ends without much resolution the hilarious one liners peculiar situations and quirky characters are sure to satisfy
<START> i <UNK> into blockbuster with a friend the other night having decided that we were too broke and too lazy to do active she decided she wanted to watch closer which seemed like such a <UNK> idea that i had to rent another film for once she'd gone to bed looking around i didn't see much that interested me but saw the doll master in the new releases section just based on the cover <UNK> a woman with a doll like face crying tears of blood i thought this would be interesting enough to rent br br as for the film itself watching it in an almost empty house with all the lights turned off it was pretty scary i must admit i've always had a bit of a <UNK> of dolls since i was a kid and watched an awful film called asylum one of the stories in it involved a mental patient creating a doll which killed people lame but scary at the time and the first three quarters of this film really hit the spot for me the first half hour in particular was awesome the creepy foreboding atmosphere really set the scene well and without moving the dolls seemed genuinely threatening but unfortunately as soon as they did start to move it all got a bit cheesy i was a bit disappointed when moments that could have been genuinely frightening made me laugh because of the way they were filmed br br as for the characters it's a horror film you're not really expecting anything memorable i found i remembered names and faces better than most asian horror films i've seen which suggests there must have been some hidden character development that i didn't <UNK> notice the typical stereotypes are out in force in this movie each one having some kind of character <UNK> that sets them apart from the others from shy and quiet ha and her doll <UNK> to the <UNK> bimbo <UNK> br br the plot itself was fairly cool even though the ending which bought together many of the loose <UNK> of plot seemed a bit confused and didn't really do anything for me although it did have a couple of really cool plot twists that i won't ruin here the basic plot is a bunch of kids are invited to be <UNK> as dolls by a famous <UNK> old doll maker they have to stay in the creepy house <UNK> with scary dolls some big some small and things start to happen as our heroine <UNK> <UNK> starts to explore areas of the house and things start happening to the other inhabitants br br overall i would definitely recommend the film not to watch with too many people as some of the moments would probably make you laugh if surrounded by friends but as something too watch on your own in the dark with the windows and doors open just a bit just in case any dolls feel like watching with you it really does leave you guessing for most of the film allowing you to go off on wild conspiracy theories only to completely destroy them later on if you really get into it and ignore it's cheesiness in places i can guarantee you'll check under your bed before you go to sleep and maybe even leave the lights on br br or maybe that's just me p as for closer it was ok but i preferred this
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this made for tv movie i was channel surfing and came across the start of the movie boy am i glad i stopped this movie has a real hot cast as well as a semi believable plot there's drama comedy action and best of all the human nature aspect of this film is what makes it great i hope it comes out on video because i will buy a copy rating 9 out of 10 stars
<START> the movie is a really well made one which is great and looking and <UNK> directed you can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection for the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into it br br it's hard to place this movie under one label it's not really a drama it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way it doesn't necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combined br br but just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts the artistic style of directing tries to <UNK> that the story is actually a quite simple one and it's more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie it doesn't make the movie horrible or anything but it just <UNK> it from being a true absolute must see in parts the movie also feels as if it's trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself it just feels a bit overdone in parts though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifully br br it features some great camera work and some unique storytelling which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch br br 7 10
<START> while the david lynch version of <UNK> is choppy awkward and <UNK> to the novel it is visually well designed and well acted the best one can say about the sci fi <UNK> attempt to make <UNK> into a miniseries is that it's ambitious actually that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer the actors with few exceptions seem happy to <UNK> their lines with the least emotion possible and the least appropriate accents the costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large <UNK> of fabric on hand and an <UNK> love of <UNK> br br in part this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of lynch's already well known effort however it takes elements from lynch's film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly <UNK> i e the <UNK> <UNK> sequence and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to lynch's film a for effort d for virtually everything else
<START> well i didn't know what to expect from <UNK> matter of fact i had never even heard of it until a few months ago but being a collector of just about all types of horror i figured i would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher br br basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row what the third 5 in the title means nobody knows anyway the killings start as the killer <UNK> for young teenagers <UNK> around in obscure places he <UNK> the men and brutally <UNK> the woman to death after this he proceeds to rape the dead corpse the police think they have a lead on the killings but really have no idea what is going on how will they find the killer does anybody care br br this movie is filled with some of the worst actors i have ever seen no wonder none of these actors went on to do anything else literally the three lead actors consist of two detectives and a sexy female reporter i am being sarcastic when i say sexy she is about as un sexy as it gets the two detectives are like watching <UNK> dee and <UNK> <UNK> one of them <UNK> his part and the other one may have gone to the shatner school of acting the acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose your interest in the movie thus almost putting you to sleep br br the only thing holding this terrible movie together is a few decent gore scenes for a movie on this budget the makers must have put all of there money into the special effects which still aren't that great br br unless you are like me and have to own every single horror movie out there i would suggest <UNK> clear of this movie 4 10
<START> well it is standard hollywood <UNK> that you can see coming a mile off it's enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable i must confess i did not really enjoy it but i am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved it br br it is quite sweet and the actors give good performances it's a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good but the <UNK> predictable unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back personally i can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life br br the chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there this isn't one of them
<START> <UNK> is an excellent blend of music light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by peter <UNK> <UNK> and and <UNK> romantic supporting performance by clark <UNK> <UNK> is able to show the shy <UNK> teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married <UNK> clark she brings him the world what a lot of flowers and he is forever changed he becomes the beloved <UNK> of through tragedy but knows he could only have achieved his goal through love the songs with the exception of the music hall number are all thought songs coming from character's emotions and thoughts and the more you listen to them the more beautiful they become walk through the world with me and you and i <UNK> finest moment is the final speech he gives to the students it was the reason for the oscar nomination as a teacher we question what book learning ever gets through but as <UNK> says we did teach them how to behave with each other and that is what really counts beautifully filmed perfectly <UNK> by john williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you did i fill the world with love the boys sing their school song by the end <UNK> realizes he was able to do it but only cause catherine was there
<START> virtual sexuality proves that britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from america the only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an american film would and a cameo by ram john <UNK> which is always welcome that's enough to make this a watcher on a cold <UNK> night
<START> a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a <UNK> bunch of characters end up in a lead <UNK> valley <UNK> just as stock footage nuclear heck is unleashed it's the end of the world four men with guns two women one an <UNK> virgin the other a las vegas show who drinks and <UNK> guess which one makes it to the end of the movie time passes tensions develop or are supposed to something is in the woods eating <UNK> <UNK> a mutant monster seven weeks of <UNK> dust has performed a million years of evolution on an already living human the result is a laughably bad <UNK> up the back rubber monster who is strangely scared of their only source of fresh water it <UNK> the monster <UNK> the remaining two characters the hunk and the virgin set out to <UNK> the world as the <UNK> 'the <UNK> fills the screen after it <UNK> that the brief shower of rain had washed all the <UNK> away and <UNK> all the monsters running around <UNK> <UNK> br br the only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of <UNK> that goes on in it one of the <UNK> elements of bad and lo budget movie making of the period was the use of <UNK> in the set design it was cheap finished with one set up pull a curtain across drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting br br <UNK> is a skill in which the actor will get to comment on what's going on outside any building he happens to be in it looks like rain or here they come now and it looks like they've got the sheriff with them that sort of stuff he'll do this by standing to one side of the window reaching across his body and <UNK> the curtain away from the window but along the <UNK> of the shot ie towards the camera thus <UNK> him to pretend to look out and tell us what's happening off screen without letting the audience see he's staring at the studio wall three <UNK> away from his nose behind some cheap <UNK> <UNK> there was a lot of that in this movie
<START> this two disc set is incredible if you're like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live then this is the next best thing jimmy page who in my opinion is the second best <UNK> ever to walk the face of the earth second only to himself he puts on an amazing show in every piece of footage in this film john paul jones although not as up front as page puts on one hell of a show although in the live atmosphere his <UNK> bass lines aren't as defined as they are on studio <UNK> except of course in songs like <UNK> and confused or what is and what should never be but his wide array of talent is well displayed in these dvd's john bonham is john bonham what can i say there is no comparison his beats stand out like no other and this dvd is proof last but not least robert plant <UNK> like no other can <UNK> if you've ever read hammer of the gods you'll be wondering the same thing as page was when he first met robert plant why the hell isn't this guy already famous and so concludes my review sorry about and spelling or <UNK> mistakes <UNK> rocks
<START> this was on scifi this past weekend and i had to check it out after all it was science fiction with vampires and erika <UNK> what could go wrong with this b movie br br a lot br br to start with it can't even be classified as a b movie because that would put it in the same league as roger corman and this movie doesn't even meet his expectations the most money they spent was on the contact <UNK> for the vampires br br secondly the casting was horrible yes casting <UNK> <UNK> as the captain of the was a smart move but the director clearly couldn't even get <UNK> to <UNK> his lines casting <UNK> in a vampire movie is also a smart move because it means a bunch of horny guys are going to buy rent record this flick to watch her get <UNK> by a vampire but the director writer and producer screwed that one too granted they got some money out of the poor souls who enjoy watching vampire movies with hot women in them but no one is going to remember this movie in another two or three years br br <UNK> little things that just emphasize the <UNK> in this movie for example van <UNK> calls a cross a <UNK> and when <UNK> is <UNK> in the coffin the viewer can clearly see the fact that her chest is nothing more than <UNK> br br oh and one other thing why did they go for the george type dracula instead of something that would look <UNK> scary does george hamilton have an overwhelming hold on our future why didn't everyone who saw dracula just laugh at him for his get up br br a waste of time even with a <UNK> remote in your hand
<START> this film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little average budget looks like van damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director <UNK> him there is your basic bar <UNK> alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting some basic drama but nothing too deep <UNK> <UNK> directs an ok action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it but the person who steals the show is br br scott <UNK> how come this guy isn't a massive arnold <UNK> caliber action star that i don't know director <UNK> <UNK> has made a movie with scott <UNK> before called special forces 2003 which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding <UNK> enthusiastic another amazing scott <UNK> feature is <UNK> 2 check this guy out and make a noise this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now br br what else can i say about the movie it's van damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work no oscars here for sure but you already knew that but never the less it has a nice little town feel and i could find worse ways to spend my time so i'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in it's genre
<START> it's rare that i get the opportunity to review a film for imdb that relates to my own life in such a close way however as someone living with cerebral <UNK> albeit less severe than michael one of the main characters in the film i don't wish to give this film a <UNK> just because it <UNK> a subject that's rarely approached and when it is is normally treated with <UNK> faced seriousness there were minor problems i had with the film and i'd like to address those first so that people are clear that it isn't my situation which has <UNK> my judgement of this overall excellent film br br parts of it i felt were <UNK> crowd pleasing at the expense of realism if i had a pound for every time a well meaning member of the public has mentioned electric wheelchair racing to me i'd be much the <UNK> man but speaking personally that fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our <UNK> rather than the reality of what actually goes on same thing with spending time watching disabled people go to the pub it's not a big deal to those of us who actually do it as much as it might be admirable for <UNK> looking in i appreciate that this is from the previously <UNK> perspective of michael but i still think he'd be <UNK> more on enjoying the experience rather than <UNK> on what a big deal it was that he was actually there in the first place as such the amount of time we spend seeing them have fun felt like a bit too much br br i felt that the <UNK> nature of illness was brought to our attention far too late meaning that it was just used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the pair rather than something everybody knew all along was going to have to be dealt with br br to balance those criticisms i have to dish out a heap of praise as well although i thought some scenes showing them getting to grips with normal life were a touch overdone the script also <UNK> into some <UNK> places i wouldn't have expected and comes out with a lot of credit for doing so for instance raising the issue of love and relationships and showing the daily <UNK> often used to aid and assist the lives of non able <UNK> people also despite the blunt emotional shock <UNK> of death being <UNK> upon us the movie as a whole is far less sappy than anyone has a right to expect these type of films to be br br brenda <UNK> can and has been performing variations of her role <UNK> on <UNK> for what seems like years but robertson and <UNK> share a special interaction that must be noted inside i'm doing <UNK> that a group of people somewhere have finally made a film doing justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons
<START> heard about this film a long while ago and finally found it on ebay for five bucks i wasn't expecting much but wow was i ever surprised it's a story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle reminds me of for <UNK> because some shots gave you a sense of vertigo sounds pretty standard but this movie is insane it's hard to believe such an original animated feature was made in <UNK> also the king was probably one of the <UNK> character's i've seen in a long time with a feminine walk weird eyes usually crossed and a soft but scary voice the only problem i had with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and hardly even any lines except for calling for mr a large talking green bird to save them the animation was fantastic in most areas but some cells were missing from some scenes which sucked it's incredibly original with flying police and giant <UNK> and even laugh out loud funny at times it's a real shame this is such an obscure title because it's really a good film check it out sometime
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br as a boy mark <UNK> c thomas <UNK> sat <UNK> as his family including his hero cop father jeff <UNK> were brutally murdered by vicious criminals he'd tried to bring down with an inner desire to <UNK> wrong <UNK> <UNK> in him as he grew up as a result of this mark employs tough means when bringing the suspects he's chasing down in and gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors because of this but then he learns of a secret group of men and women lead by a mysterious man ed <UNK> who serve to dish out punishment that fits the crime outside the law but then things get out of hand and getting out alive might be harder than he thought br br the <UNK> gets into problems from the off set because we've seen this exact same plot done before and better in films like the star chamber with michael douglas and <UNK> force with clint eastwood the title doesn't make any sense either but we also have to <UNK> with the movie's utter <UNK> including a scene where a daughter's manages to <UNK> out the sound of her family being slaughtered a finale involving a chase with a bad guy that starts on the <UNK> and ends on a wright brothers plane as well as some of the most ridiculous acting ever put on screen and a very clichéd pretentious script but there's some cool action sequences here and there and the movie's unintentional laughs factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse
<START> it opens and for half an hour runs like an educational programme on the old testament although not without humour the movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant gets dropped in a scene of mixed success martin <UNK> jesus decides to on kicking off the apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a sort of <UNK> <UNK> all the fuss about ' play out <UNK> with optimistic against a <UNK> miserably ironic long shot of the <UNK> twin towers br br apart from authority the acting is split there's the <UNK> melodrama of the rest of the cast this though <UNK> contrived for biblical presentation is appropriate for the modern paranoid comedy that hartley's aiming at but i was also pleasantly surprised at the contribution of <UNK> harvey credited thus and in danger of existing within the film solely as the pop star <UNK> she is not least in a set piece scene in a record store and a <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack to which contributes she remained cool a sort of <UNK> lack of focus in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film i'm thinking the jagger of performance here but nonetheless <UNK> a convincing <UNK> with both cast and project br br ultimately <UNK> but this bittersweet <UNK> is a bit too much like one and relies more on the <UNK> than the imagination of its audience 4 10
<START> going into teaching mrs <UNK> all i wanted was a fun enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for it's running time despite a rather good first half hour the film quickly <UNK> into a dull clichéd mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your <UNK> with <UNK> rusty <UNK> at that <UNK> writer kevin <UNK> wrote and directed this movie and proved that scream may well have been a <UNK> most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films and while it was ok for him to steal elements from other movies in scream due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute here it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas the plot follows the <UNK> girl in school played by katie holmes after being caught cheating along with two of her friends the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home however this isn't just any teacher it's mrs <UNK> the <UNK> bitch in school she isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either as she begins to play mind games to turn her <UNK> against each other br br the plot is very similar to the 1997 flick <UNK> <UNK> and a whole host of earlier films it's actually not a bad idea for a movie and if <UNK> could have populated the film with interesting characters it could have worked really well the character of mrs <UNK> is the most interesting in the movie but she's <UNK> one dimensional and like all the other characters in the film is merely a caricature the acting is largely diabolical with the exception of helen <UNK> in the title role she's suitably evil in the role and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure the teenage cast isn't worth mentioning with only katie holmes standing out and that's only really because of her star profile not her acting talents <UNK> has <UNK> nearly every scene in dull soft rock music which would be really annoying if the film wasn't absolutely terrible anyway honestly this movie does have a few moments that are rather good but basically if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy this isn't the movie that you want to see
<START> there was once someone in my family not saying who it is because of personal reasons who thinks that mr bean is always so silly in whatever he does on the comedy series imagine how i felt at that time shocked instantly br br there are more reasons than one why i love watching mr bean being one of those earliest shows on the local television here in my country where i first grew up watching it's just one of those things which had stuck into my head there was even once my friends and i talked about few of the selected episodes and we just laughed together br br it's always silly funny and hilarious in whatever antics <UNK> <UNK> as mr bean will do in each episode though lately at times it may show some of the repeats here it never failed to bring back those childhood memories of mine in fact i can dare say this is the very first show which introduces me about the kind of shows which come out of the uk as i was growing up br br the comedy series definitely really wicked as what the brits may be saying
<START> the movie and the earth did not swallow him based on the book by <UNK> <UNK> is an eye opening movie for most people it talks about the exploitation that <UNK> go through in order to survive br br sergio <UNK> uses <UNK> techniques to depict <UNK> story he uses <UNK> and gray scale effects to depict some of the scenes and he uses specific <UNK> techniques to make the scenes look like they took place in the 1950s br br <UNK> also gives life to the film by using time appropriate music including and guitar playing br br i feel that it is a good film to view because it shows in detail how <UNK> live what they do for entertainment and their beliefs
<START> i love sarah plain and tall winters end its such a good movie it tells of the <UNK> of living on a farm i live on a farm so i know what its like to have <UNK> br br i love the setting in kansas its such a beautiful place my favorite country star is from kansas i love the country in kansas its just so beautiful i would love to live in kansas br br sarah plain and tall winters end i think is a love story i love love stories they are so fun to watch i like to watch them because it is nice to watch people fall in love falling in love is not as hard as most people think i've fallen in love once sarah plain and tall winters end is my favorite love story
<START> when i first saw this dvd in a bargain bin for three dollars i really couldn't believe my luck a christmas movie starring <UNK> spelling william shatner and gary coleman needless to say i <UNK> it up immediately and considered it a worthwhile investment br br the movie itself was just as bad as any movie you'd expect to be combining christmas and the three aforementioned celebrities the dialogue was inane the characters were one dimensional and <UNK> character arc was completely unbelievable the movie itself was a lifeless piece of boring that refused to end and made me feel used as a human being when the end did finally come br br my advice don't watch this movie unless you have to and then only under the influence of some serious holiday <UNK>
<START> this movie is based on the novel island of dr <UNK> by h g wells it's a fairly good one too it's at least better than the version by john <UNK>
<START> war is in your blood rambo says early in the film don't fight it say what is the scriptwriter taking the mickey out of sly it is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here yet stallone <UNK> it without a hint of irony br br the same lack of humour applies to the movie rambo iv is an over the top idiotic <UNK> that would have been funny without intention if it weren't <UNK> violent a redneck fantasy of the <UNK> kind where villains are so villainous it is not enough just to kill them  you have to <UNK> them with <UNK> stallone stops at no blue collar cliché to make his point it is not enough for the chief villain to be feed them to the pigs throw babies into fire kind of <UNK> he is also a <UNK> homosexual br br what is happening to imdb is it taken over by the rifle society how can this <UNK> excuse for gross exploitation rate that high i like a good action movie as much as the next man but this is not entertainment  this is pornography of violence that <UNK> and ultimately <UNK> the real tragedy of the only good thing about the movie is that sly doesn't take his shirt off for this i will give it one star
<START> the essence of this film falls on <UNK> by police officers who fortunately <UNK> and moral men act on situations within situations in a city with a super abundance of violence and killing good compound <UNK> story lines and above average characterizations
<START> for this movie based off of a tv show and a serious finale i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious <UNK> a s h goodbye farewell and was pretty good but not this one unless you really love the series like myself skip this movie br br i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens but the plot was too <UNK> and dave <UNK> man that guy hasn't done anything good well ever they shouldn't have used tim meadows he's a great actor but he was too good for the script br br i thought the movie was pure cheese i would give it a 4 5 10
<START> i do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it it's one of the best teenager horror films i've ever seen and that's saying a lot nothing is left without an explanation to back it up the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been <UNK> to lately a clear example is the mindless saint <UNK> the first 30 40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted after the arrival to the village though the horror a different twisted kind of horror begins br br with the plot and the details goofs are minor the characters are this movie's strongest point given that so many clichés are broken in it for example the two main male characters nick and <UNK> are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to although dalton might fit better in this stereotype not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness some scenes are truly <UNK> horrible making up for tense moments scattered around all the film and in the end and although everything is explained it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters br br the only errors i can see and which do not imply continuity ie <UNK> not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> which is somehow annoying during the first boring 30 minutes although plot and effects wise everything is drastically and <UNK> twisted with the arrival of the main characters to that little village in the midst of nothing so i'll give it that it's been pretty much <UNK> that about 70 of the movie is illogical how can two people build an entire house of wax where do they get all the wax from these wouldn't be <UNK> questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie the <UNK> brothers did not build the house of wax their mother worked making actual wax figures and they were <UNK> at the museum and the scenario where paris <UNK> unfortunate character meets her <UNK> death is the answer to the second question what is with all the personal objects mobile phones cars clothes of the dead people using their third brother as a connection with the exterior it's pretty much <UNK> that the <UNK> twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax in a wwii type fashion br br so that aside i think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets and nobody should lose the chance to watch it so go see the house of wax right now
<START> i was watching an <UNK> game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the hbo type channels i missed the beginning but when i started watching deadly voyage the was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled you will find yourself rooting against the and on the edge of your la z boy throughout this one if you get the chance take the time to watch it every once in a while i think about having the cable company take off my movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them happy holidays to all from cape <UNK>
<START> love life explores a very <UNK> relevant scenario of a marriage of <UNK> between a lesbian and a gay man i found the subject matter compelling even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved for example thomas falls for joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage <UNK> glasses the one that got to me the most was the fact <UNK> facial hair <UNK> seemed to change from scene to scene in the end i found myself more turned on by this movie than moved <UNK> d <UNK> has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with skill and <UNK> and all too often acting chops to match many times the movie seems like it is going to go full on porn stephanie does a fine job but her moment of enlightenment at the end was <UNK> a bit for me since i was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie
<START> okay i'm not sure if this counts as a spoiler so i just <UNK> the box anyway to save the <UNK> br br i've noticed that the opinions on this film seem to be a fair split personally i loved it although i must say that i think that some of the <UNK> were there for the sake of having a cameo peter kay personally i am just thankful that it wasn't the edward <UNK> and <UNK> show and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to <UNK> the motion picture especially sir <UNK> arguably the funniest of the bunch br br actually this is less of a summary more of a fairly <UNK> <UNK> like thing but what the hell the film was awesome and i guess that's all that counts
<START> there's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie it's just a brainless comedy don't take it seriously dude well that's one point of view the other would be why are we accepting exactly the same script the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these comedies br br what you get is a <UNK> who through some totally unreal circumstances has to change his life always a he overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a <UNK> or a teenager beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a <UNK> but with more money self <UNK> on the way somebody does something gross but very illogical this means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like you won't believe it this guy finds the <UNK> drowned in the bucket of <UNK> the other guy left after he ate <UNK> then he shines his shoes with it hilarious br br most of the usual names turn up david spade and rob schneider do unfunny <UNK> but they're characters a russian and i'm holding my sides a <UNK> in a <UNK> restaurant adam sandler the king of the brainless unfunny illogical comedy co produces and some talentless nobody called <UNK> shows up yet again the us will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy <UNK> is famous for <UNK> we are clueless allen <UNK> plays a <UNK> year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me he was <UNK> and looked years older br br did i laugh yes but no more than i would at a tv sit com and i don't have to pay a penny to watch them please stop making these movies
<START> this movie attempted to make <UNK> life interesting by being creative what they forgot is that his life was plenty entertaining enough on it's own without having to make things up br br a short list of the inaccuracies br br 1 was not sent straight to las vegas for a <UNK> <UNK> to pay off old <UNK> he spent a good deal of time in florida first and only went to las vegas when he ran out of <UNK> games on the east coast br br 2 never associated or played <UNK> with a casino executive like the one played by pat <UNK> in the movie br br 3 there was no magical <UNK> in the <UNK> to the 1997 in fact barely made it into the <UNK> as it was he cocaine the week before even br br either tell the story right or don't tell it at all 4 out of 10 stars for michael credible performance the only redeeming quality of this movie
<START> quite simply a well made well written and wonderfully acted movie eastwood is classic as <UNK> secret service agent frank and <UNK> russo br br holds her own as partner and love interest <UNK> raines but the movie's br br greatness rests on the shoulders of john <UNK> as booth he captures br br this character's rage and hatred as well as his humanity oddly enough br br personally i think this was his best performance and should have received an br br oscar for it but i loved tommy lee jones in the fugitive as well that year overall a great movie to see you want to <UNK> into an <UNK> mind and be br br on the edge of your seat the whole way through enjoy
<START> when just days away before the film's premiere its screenwriter backs out of the project and demands his name to be removed from the credits you know that this does not <UNK> well br br the books on which is based on have great potential for a <UNK> fantasy film  de is a his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world but not everything monstrous looking is evil and not everything fair is but all that didn't matter when a polish film crew with a low budget and no or little appreciation for work decided to make a 13 part mini series out of it the two hour film is a by product of their actions to <UNK> the <UNK> br br it's not hard to point out in this case what makes people label this film as bad plot incoherent thanks to <UNK> it with too many stories acting below average with exception of dialogues bland editing choppy special effects unbearable and choreography poor add up to the film's overall bad experience only the soundtrack done by brings out the beauty of the world of which was never brought to the screen even <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> where part of the chronicles of <UNK> the lion the witch and the wardrobe was shot a crucial element in almost any fantasy film were not used up to their full potential the more i think about this dead loss the more i'm running out of words at least it's a comfort to know that the director of has directed only one film ever since in addition in germany br br for now we're left with top notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer <UNK> released in 2007 referring to the books but i'm sure that one day justice will be done for the saga and we'll be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon enough
<START> without going into any details of a good if a somewhat provocative tv movie there seems to be a <UNK> among the users that there is no one to blame here br br i disagree yes the young male lover of beverly <UNK> played by rob <UNK> may be young and horny and good looking because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesn't mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter ok he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch tv with her but i don't buy it people have to take responsibility for their actions not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly the responsible adult he said your mom must never know about this how responsible was he then yes it's a good flick but he got what was coming to him don't kid yourselves folks that what happened was no one's fault
<START> back in college i studied marketing and even though i missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention i will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing namely it's not what you sell it's how you sell it this principle fully applies to the devil's triangle as it's basically a beautifully wrapped and <UNK> yet empty package writer director richard knew exactly that he had to <UNK> the viewer's attention away from the major inaccuracies so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere like the sinister voice of narrator vincent price and the oddball music of king <UNK> and i'm guessing richard dirty little tricks worked very <UNK> as there was a huge <UNK> triangle hype going on during the mid 70's and literally every movie production  whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a sleazy exploitation flick  covering the topic earned big money at the box office the devil's triangle <UNK> you with data that is <UNK> and often irrelevant but the severe <UNK> of the facts and of course the <UNK> stark voice of the almighty vincent price <UNK> an ambiance of fright and creepiness the narration constantly jumps back and forward in time and covers a massive amount of strange <UNK> and mysterious <UNK> of ships and <UNK> in the <UNK> triangle throughout a period of nearly one whole century but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the <UNK> mr price <UNK> ends every chapter with the sinister words  just another <UNK> mystery of the devil's after a couple of cases the whole formula simply becomes laughable and almost pathetic but i guess it caused genuine mass <UNK> back in 1974 the documentary <UNK> a little more on the most notorious <UNK> triangle mysteries like the five planes of military flight 19 that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but still even in these chapters only a minimum of <UNK> information is given the cameras never at one point go underwater to explore the depths of the <UNK> area for example and the <UNK> of the supposedly real life witnesses of the dramas <UNK> look like staged acting scenes if you're looking for an informative and objective documentary on the <UNK> triangle i certainly wouldn't recommend this movie but in case you want to sit back and listen to vincent <UNK> <UNK> voice for nearly a full hour this is your chance
<START> the first two movies of this series <UNK> for their footage of the natural world and ordinary people stuck in the midst of society this movie doesn't have any of that natural footage which i understand is part of the point but it really makes the entire video <UNK> of the film seem like random images stuck together ones and <UNK> flying around computer models of human <UNK> and so forth occasionally the stock footage is put to good effect the <UNK> <UNK> segment around 35 00 but usually it makes the video appear to lack any meaningful content and demands you accept the context of the stock <UNK> rather than the context of the director it's no better than the video displayed on a <UNK> machine three stars added for the philip glass soundtrack
<START> this is a very good black comedy with a great view on how different people have a different perception of the same situations the three main characters each met a girl named jewel played by <UNK> tyler who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men each of the three men go through the same situations but when they tell of them to other people their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say that is a very good concept probably not entirely original but it works very well in the movie the plot is very good very bizarre and extreme which makes it a good black comedy the acting is equally good not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league the comedy is very black pitch black in some scenes and a lot of people will definitely be offended by it but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it overall this movie is not for everyone's taste but most people who like black comedy will probably love it as it is definitely one of the better black comedies 7 10
<START> i don't know what movement was this film about i saw this film a year ago i am an <UNK> woman living in an <UNK> community and i can tell you i was offended by this movie it's so far away from the reality it's scary the director could at least hire a <UNK> for a brief <UNK> before making a realistic movie about ultra for example morning <UNK> or a jewish wedding or a ritual bath customs br br movie is loaded with technical inaccuracies but it's not them that bothered me it's the spiritual side are portrayed next to <UNK> woman are <UNK> while men are the ultimate <UNK> please no one can force a jewish girl to the against her will we also live by the law which clearly states man's <UNK> towards his wife no beating and no <UNK> also and no man even <UNK> is allowed to peak at the woman in the and is not to place a hand over woman's head while she's taking a ritual bath the idea is to <UNK> the whole body at one time director was clearly trying to bash ultra but could he do so at least in a nice and more educated manner br br love story cute but not credible dialogs are long and boring the ending sucked totally for all that drama i was at least hoping for a nice ending for all that sitting i felt i deserved it obviously someone was trying to make a nice consciousness <UNK> movie for less <UNK> jews or for non jews perhaps look at those <UNK> they are so evil and mean and they succeed long thing short was hoping for a nice kane level movie got instead a tradition bashing unrealistic <UNK> <UNK> junk i mean today we live in a time of a free will as never before everyone has a right to choose chose a rock singer made her choice <UNK> made his many people from non <UNK> backgrounds are choosing <UNK> <UNK> these days because in this mad world religion might be a nice <UNK>
<START> after reading many good things about it i finally watched the <UNK> with a cast of great actors like redford and dafoe one would at least expect a decent film after the closing credits had rolled i was still shocked by how bad and incoherent this movie actually was br br is it supposed to be an art film i don't think so cause it is too melodramatic for that the bad thing is that the drama seems way too forced and unrealistic br br the truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense first of all it never really explains the motive behind the actions of any of the characters it just their so called personal issues what's so bad about <UNK> character's life that he has to clear it the fact that he <UNK> occasionally his wife the guy is a millionaire who has had a good life has a great son and a great daughter a wife that loves him and a girlfriend that also seems to be way above the generic mistress type of woman o and a new born <UNK> the only problem seems to be that he has been working hard for all his life to be a successful person so what it seems that his hard work has really paid off and there's actually no real problems with his life br br then we come to <UNK> character here's someone who was a manager for one of <UNK> companies and was fired why is this guy unemployed for eight years it seems that he must have some kind of good education to have a job like the one he had in the first place and seems to have been a man with solid ideas about his work as evident by his flashback of a conversation that he had with redford when he was working for him why couldn't a man like that get a decent job and have a decent life cause he was once fired totally unrealistic br br the film really tries to portray these men as tortured souls or something and that comes off as really cheesy in fact i would say that if the creators of this film were trying to say something about the american dream then they failed miserably br br as for the actual events that take place during the movie they also make no sense at all in fact the last 20 minutes of the film come off as an insult to the viewer's intelligence because there's not one thing that takes place that actually makes any sense redford seems to have about a 1000 chances to escape yet he doesn't at one moment he is ready to escape and yet he misses his chance cause he feels sorry for his <UNK> and doesn't want to hurt him then dafoe picks up his gun from the water and the mud which should be useless if you fire a shot with a gun after the gun has been in the water and mud it will possibly blow up in your face and the gun is in perfect condition the way an unemployed useless as portrayed in this film and mentally unstable character manages to <UNK> the entire fbi with such ease brings the narrative of this film to twilight zone levels the cheesy ending with <UNK> wife illusion comes to finish the viewer off br br this film pretends to be something it's not i e a quality sophisticated psychological thriller unfortunately it fails so hard that it becomes a disaster and that's the word that describes this film best a disaster
<START> that's certainly not the best film ever but that's certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind so the one who loves sadness and depression and scary fairy tales at night and wolves and real madness welcome if you find a copy of course as for me i could stand it only once but since that the wolves and saint lucy and children's drawings and a <UNK> christ live in my nightmares
<START> this film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally at the end of the 1960's decade it was immensely entertaining and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period and were still ongoing in terms of the black power movement vietnam and the <UNK> movement which followed the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1950's br br all of this and one of the funniest films then or now br br viewing it for the second time recently i was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally its humor is as funny and its message as strong br br and in viewing it now you get all of this while at the same time gaining the added enjoyment of its being a period piece and a superb <UNK> of its this historic <UNK> time
<START> would be promising if it were a student film never seems to know where it's going next as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film as a result much <UNK> and a <UNK> pace there's an absolutely confusing <UNK> by which the ghosts affect people in this world it involves the internet phone calls a computer science experiment a suspicious <UNK> student <UNK> behavior red rooms dark <UNK> and then <UNK> good luck <UNK> out the connections or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely characters are barely <UNK> which could be ok but they're completely uninteresting it's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario although the conclusion is nonsensical weakest moment when the boss sits down to give some incoherent advice
<START> i am not a golf fan by any means on may 26 about 10 30 <UNK> the movie started with a scene in the late <UNK> old movies i like but not golf however within the first scene a young boy harry is <UNK> by the voices of men he goes outside to <UNK> what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something so then i turned the television off but something <UNK> me and it was back on the movie is excellent we then see this young boy now a man professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period then there is little eddie <UNK> his <UNK> with <UNK> words and little pushes that are <UNK> in francis winning don't want to give away too much i was up until 2 a m this is super please see the movie
<START> it sounded so promising in the rental store the premise sounded great and i <UNK> wait to get home and watch it it was <UNK> the <UNK> is dreadful the action is extremely badly scripted and the plot takes a <UNK> from the beginning <UNK> puts in a pathetic performance sean bean tries his best but with a script this bad there <UNK> much he could do br br this <UNK> even worth watching even if you can get it for free borrow it off a friend for instance dont as you will regret it and waste 90 of your life br br 0 10
<START> in the movie the <UNK> and the snowman when they were showing christopher <UNK> around the complex the satellite in the background was the actual satellite that is now in space allowed interior shots also allowed both interior and exterior shots for one of the original star trek tv series the episode is the one where spock goes blind when a string of satellite lights are <UNK> to kill the aliens christopher escaped jail and was featured on america's most wanted he was drinking in a bar when the show aired he said hey that's me needless to say he was captured and <UNK> to a maximum security jail
<START> i saw night of the demons 2 first before i saw night of the demons unfortunately my old blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the sequel but no first one looney huh now i think all horror fans need this movie it's like <UNK> you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have the <UNK> or whatever restaurant you prefer but you can't help but just wanting the cheap stuff br br night of the demons has it all your innocent sexy goes by the rules <UNK> dee your token black guy that surprisingly doesn't get killed you're <UNK> girl you're <UNK> guy you're dark girl or guy the goof ball the cheesy settings of a haunted house bad acting and lots of unnecessary nudity isn't this stuff great i mean i know deep down in my heart of movies that this was pretty bad but it was a good bad for horror movies horror fans should enjoy and dig in br br 8 10
<START> this film is about two female killers going on a tour to kill random men they meet br br wow <UNK> <UNK> just became the worst film of all time in my list the plot is crazy pointless and unnecessary the whole film is full of violence and sex and i am sure no sane parents would want to show this film to their children i don't understand what people get out of by making this film or watching this film maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires <UNK> there is simply no excuse or reasons for the existence of this perverted and <UNK> piece of work br br the only <UNK> i offer myself is that i watched it on fast forward so that i have not wasted as much time
<START> <UNK> <UNK> strikes again with <UNK> of a beautiful woman the sequel to <UNK> of a virgin this time around the story is based around a psychologist <UNK> who decides to take on the <UNK> to avenge the suicide of a <UNK> up and raped patient that winds up on her <UNK> one day when she gets over her head and the <UNK> capture her she learns their <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> up girls and selling them into slavery it apparently ends badly when she <UNK> from the cocaine but she soon <UNK> with another body to be <UNK> of to <UNK> <UNK>  super <UNK> this he she it makes <UNK> meat out of the <UNK> and saves the really br br well it is better than <UNK> of a virgin but not by much most of the film a <UNK> <UNK> minutes consists of rape and sex with <UNK> and the usual ho hum stuff almost towards the end we finally get our gore groove on with a few cool sequence like an alien inspired penis monster through the stomach scene and a <UNK> but it still suffers from a hyper low budget feel that makes it fun but can't elevate it from z grade soft horror core fare
<START> i tend to fall in and out of love with anime as the more you watch the more you notice a lot of shows are just poor copies of the few gems or <UNK> of old <UNK> but every once in a while one of the true gems comes along and it's originality just blows you away is truly one of those shows many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated show is rather poorly done and doesn't <UNK> the benefits animation has over static drawings is actually based on a series of light novels and fires on all <UNK> beautiful animation great voice acting great music and a complete and well paced story watch it you won't be disappointed and i'd suggest watching it in broadcast order it works so much better that way
<START> i hope we never become to cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this movie beautiful to look at with its romantic english countryside and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty watch this with your children especially your young daughters <UNK> brown is a wonderful role model for girls this was one of my daughter's favorite films br br the story is based on a best selling book by <UNK> about a girl <UNK> whose whole life is her horse <UNK> and about her single minded pursuit of her impossible dream i won't say anymore about the plot less i spoil it for first time viewers she lives with a big loving family in a small <UNK> village br br this is the movie that made elizabeth taylor a star and to watch the film is to understand why she is a natural actress who <UNK> an inner beauty that matches her <UNK> beauty <UNK> passionate innocent she is the emotional core of the movie br br mickey rooney gives a wonderful performance as <UNK> the young man who arrives on their <UNK> one day stays and helps <UNK> train the <UNK> this is one of his finest performances also standing out is anne <UNK> as mother in an academy award winning role her strong loving and wise character understands that life isn't of much value unless you follow your dreams we're alike i too believe that everyone should have a chance at a breathtaking piece of <UNK> once in his life br br i <UNK> recommend this very sweet very inspiring classic from hollywood's golden age
<START> i really liked the first part of this film in africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by <UNK> humans in scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad i couldn't watch some of it however this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didn't understand by studying it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied which we know now shouldn't be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as as possible i do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the 19th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple beautifully primitive life tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by <UNK> after the violent death of his parents in the african jungle br br christopher <UNK> was wonderful and very <UNK> in his life of tarzan role as was ralph richardson in his last film role as <UNK> ultra rich <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in scotland andy <UNK> was pretty and pretty good as <UNK> <UNK> up and <UNK> jane in her first movie role from his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes i cannot understand why <UNK> did not later become a big star but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in the terrific ian <UNK> as a wounded frenchman in africa helped by tarzan and who then <UNK> tarzan back to his previously unknown <UNK> home in scotland was great as always br br i am so glad tarzan got sick of and didn't stay in the animal cruel <UNK> world at that time and went home to africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape relatives who raised him instead of staying in scotland and living like <UNK> which would have ruined him if it didn't kill him first
<START> a man by the name of joseph is found brutally murdered in his apartment it would appear that was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the previous evening and with one of them seemingly missing the evidence certainly <UNK> the missing soldier but as detective <UNK> <UNK> deeper into the case he finds that they could be <UNK> up the wrong tree and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and vile anti <UNK> br br <UNK> was born out of the novel written by richard brooks adapted by john paxton and directed by the <UNK> excellent edward <UNK> titled cradle of fear is a taut and gripping picture that <UNK> <UNK> anti <UNK> tho the makers were forced to tone down the story from the original source the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti <UNK> what remains largely due to rko <UNK> <UNK> and producer adrian scott is a sort of <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> with <UNK> style br br the cast features three <UNK> young mitchum and ryan with noir darling gloria <UNK> adding the emotional female heart tho only third billed it's robert <UNK> picture all the way his portrayal as the bullying conniving <UNK> is from the top draw and perfectly showcases the talent that he had in abundance ryan had good cause to give <UNK> some of is best work for he had served in the <UNK> with richard brooks himself both men having discussed the possibility that if the novel was to be made into a film then ryan wanted in and to play <UNK> thus the <UNK> of <UNK> career as <UNK> types was born gloria <UNK> also puts in a wonderful and heartfelt turn which is all the more remarkable since she was being plagued by her abusive husband at the time stanley was known to be violent towards her and his constant presence around the set <UNK> others in the cast but <UNK> probably <UNK> real life emotion became the character of <UNK> and <UNK> very bright indeed both bob mitchum and bob young come out with flying colours as well to really seal the deal on what a <UNK> acted picture <UNK> really is br br tho <UNK> was released before the other <UNK> anti <UNK> picture <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in over a million and a quarter dollars at the box office some of its thunder was stolen by the academy award winning picture from fox studio nominated for best picture best supporting actor ryan best supporting actress <UNK> best director and best screenplay it won nothing but critics of the time <UNK> it as a brilliant shift in american cinema and today it stands tall proud and dark as a bold and excellent piece of work 8 5 10
<START> i saw the movie at the <UNK> film festival on may 1 2003 it was amazing all the things that i had read about were portrayed incredibly well by tony writer director producer editor michael <UNK> incredible job as and all the others involved in this i'm glad he didn't go down the leaving las vegas routine with bad <UNK> but instead put us inside his life family and his gift <UNK> the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his <UNK> skill a big thumbs up on this one
<START> let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies psycho 1960 has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction poor acting and poor cast the best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step acting by acting and process by process to the original br br alfred hitchcock one of the greatest movie directors ever lived had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the <UNK> of color at that time okay people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 oscars gus van <UNK> had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998 what should have looked realistic in color did not after the shower scene norman <UNK> his hands it is easily that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax once he <UNK> off the blood his hand is red in color br br about acting perhaps there couldn't have been a better cast of janet leigh and anthony <UNK> in the original <UNK> suited well for norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger <UNK> wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine in this version i personally think vince vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play <UNK> role unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible in the motel office where norman and marion have the long conversation he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout in the original in the same scene when the <UNK> is described we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on <UNK> face and he looks angry although not <UNK> vince vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he's just had his lines by heart again terrible acting same is with anne <UNK> in the opening scene in the original we can see how <UNK> and nervous marion janet is when she drives to phoenix she was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life that's what i call acting in the remake <UNK> has no signs of fear and she smiles <UNK> for getting the money i don't think anyone would be happy and smiling when they've just stolen and the entire state police is behind them in the shower scene janet in the original grips the curtain turns around and dies after getting stabbed in the remake <UNK> gets stabbed turns around then <UNK> the other way has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort again terrible acting br br there are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation in the scene where gets murdered two scenes blink in between the stabs one with a naked woman and the other with a sheep many people including myself aren't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was what on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an <UNK> murder the changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary there are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well br br let me add some and the only positive points along with that i felt <UNK> moore did her job well and played a good character of <UNK> and william macy acted well that was almost exactly how character should have been played br br it is common man's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line and to try and make it look better than the original and if anything has happened here according to what i just said it is directly the opposite unfortunately many people like me weren't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version br br please do not watch this movie it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not the best
<START> i saw this film on the same night i saw 6 other shorts this one was leaps and <UNK> ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting directing filming and originality of story it comes together with a <UNK> often lacking in short films br br this is a great short film for the following reasons br br 1 amazing performances the 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly their chemistry is <UNK> the depth of their relationship is conveyed even though the film is 10 mins long the acting and directing are very powerful br br 2 beautifully shot the lighting framing and general filming are striking the <UNK> film sets this movie apart from other shorts and what a difference it makes the filming is worthy of this film stock br br 3 strong story often short films try to do too little or too much with the time or they are trying to tell a predictable story this is a good balance of telling you an interesting story without drawing it out too long or leaving you <UNK> you wonder what will happen next while at the same time feeling you saw something happen br br nice score too <UNK> without <UNK> br br if you can find this at a festival make an effort to see it
<START> side show is one of the <UNK> horror movies ever made from full moon pictures very gory in some places but not as shocking as the trailer makes it out to be the trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts also the acting and visual effects are well done i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere br br 8 out of 10 br br fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive <UNK> party massacre sleep away camp and other full moon pictures flicks for other <UNK> check out the other comments i have sent in by <UNK> on my name above this comment section
<START> i just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples <UNK> comments but found some high marks br br what this was probably the worst asian horror movie i've seen br br spoilers there were just so many fundamental problems with the story a lot of asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary with notable exceptions <UNK> and <UNK> on this is the case here except they aren't scary a pretty asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all the monk character straight up explains everything as being a perfectly natural cycle of life nothing scary there either but the woman just doesn't get it she would rather kill herself and her baby then let this poor ghost be <UNK> my friend and i were just laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why she's been following her around that information would have been nice to know before she started jumping but whatever br br that said i did like a couple of parts right in the middle first she rides a taxi with a ghost ghosts ride <UNK> that has a whole lot of extra hair which inexplicably is creepy right after that at the bus stop well you need to see it as it's pretty messed up br br all in all this movie is a total bomb i gave it an extra point just for those two scenes above this is a poor quality asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into women's almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images
<START> this is by far the worst and most stupid show i have ever seen on tv it is almost physically painful to watch an adult well in his <UNK> doing nothing but torture and mock his parents who always seem to have no clue what so ever about the stunts they are forced to endure by their <UNK> son and his equally stupid friends of course i know his parents are in on it but i really hate how they always act like they are caught completely by surprise it seems fake through and through and i really hate the intro of the show in which a voice over asks <UNK> what will he think of next i think that's how it is anyway and <UNK> himself answers whatever the f k i want wow <UNK> is really a hell <UNK> living at home with mum and dad of course the word f k is replaced with a <UNK> <UNK> but we get the message <UNK> is the real deal rebel at least in his own eyes of course <UNK> and his <UNK> of <UNK> aim at an audience of teenage boys and of course it's a mtv show but please raise the bar a little it's painfully predictable and stupid and therefore nothing but boring
<START> worst movie ever i can't believe they had to hire jeremy <UNK> to give this piece of crap some credibility and still failed did they think that if they stuck to the plot of the book that their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own probably hey let's make lots of things explode and give <UNK> big boobs and have her speak in an <UNK> fake broken english that'll make the morons watch but sir that's not how the book went at all i think we're <UNK> being faithful to mr <UNK> message f <UNK> it we're going to the box office here never mind some dead author's ideas on human nature also let's add in orlando jones with some classic <UNK> as a supporting character and never mind the interesting conclusion to the book guy pierce has to get some p at the end
<START> the great dictator is a beyond excellent film charlie chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against <UNK> the anti nazi speech by chaplin at the end with its values is one of <UNK> great moments throughout this movie i <UNK> there was some higher form of intelligence beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking at work
<START> after <UNK> up five seasons on the small screen from 1976 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> transferred themselves to the big screen in mid 1980 instead of <UNK> <UNK> and brian <UNK> <UNK> their roles as writers dick <UNK> was brought on board as the writer sadly this film adaption just did not seem to hit the spot with the public shame i liked it better than the series itself in fact it was a guilty pleasure br br <UNK> <UNK> is keen to <UNK> whether or not her <UNK> husband <UNK> brian murphy has remembered their wedding <UNK> obviously he hasn't but to try and convince his wife otherwise he books a table at the restaurant where he <UNK> marriage to mildred several years ago br br upon arriving at the restaurant they find out that the place has changed hands eventually seeing through <UNK> lies mildred insists that they celebrate their <UNK> at a <UNK> hotel upon arriving at the hotel george is mistaken by crook <UNK> for a ruthless hit man who wants a rival to be <UNK> br br not an outstanding comedy as such but a good natured piece of fun all the same plans to revive the series after the film's showing were sadly <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> died on <UNK> august 1980 of alcohol <UNK> br br funniest moment george talking to his favourite garden <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> creeps up behind him and says think its time we had a george thinking it has developed the power of speech drops the <UNK> in shock br br merry christmas to fellow imdb users in particular and have a good one
<START> after seeing the harry potter movies i've been a fan of the trio actors rupert daniel <UNK> and emma watson yet we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the j k series mainly instead of a trio the cameras and magazine <UNK> concentrate more on daniel and emma being that they're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving rupert dead end no matter every actor has a time to shine and light hits him for once in this movie br br driving lessons is called the harold and <UNK> of this generation with rupert playing the role of ben marshall a young british <UNK> who lives with his <UNK> mother laura <UNK> and a <UNK> of a <UNK> priest father for which he wants a job in the summer but can't find work while at the same time taking his driving <UNK> and failing and writing poetry for a young girl who doesn't have any interest in him br br ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady he takes the job and realizes that he's in for a fun of surprises as julie <UNK> mother in the harry potter series an out of work actress who is also a poet giving ben the run for his money they bond where and tell each other secrets along with acting like a child and getting into <UNK> where she drags ben along for a country road trip from their not only does ben drive all the way from britain to scotland since needs to <UNK> at a local library but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which ben starts becoming a man br br there is <UNK> and at the same time <UNK> with ben and along with saying that i was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and i was impressed with rupert acting especially if he showed the rest of the world that even though he brings a bit of ron within ben marshall there's no stopping the actor on his brilliant performance
<START> kramer vs kramer won five oscars including best picture of 1979 this intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years walks out on him leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had robert <UNK> screenplay presents us flawed but real human beings with hearts souls and brains for instance in the scene where joanna <UNK> to ted she's leaving him she doesn't just storm out the door she gives him the keys her credit cards the dry cleaning ticket tells him which bills have been paid and informs him she has <UNK> from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married no more this decision to leave was not a <UNK> it was thought about and joanna felt with no other option than to leave if she was leaving she was going to do it properly and with no specific plan in mind she did not think it right to take billy dustin hoffman won an oscar for his ted kramer a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon he had no clue that his life at home was <UNK> into pieces meryl streep also won an oscar playing joanna the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son hoffman is at the top of his form here i always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to billy justin henry oscar <UNK> why his mom left and he does it all in a stage <UNK> or when he meets joanna upon her return and <UNK> her drink into a wall a hoffman moment not in the script that streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction justin henry hits all the right notes as billy the confused little boy who doesn't know why his mom is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father jane alexander also got an oscar nod as ted and neighbor margaret who has switched <UNK> by the film's conclusion this is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too billy and the chocolate chip ice cream billy <UNK> because ted is late picking him for a party billy catching his <UNK> one night stand <UNK> williams on her way to the bathroom stark naked but it's the moments of human drama you remember ted running through manhattan with billy in his arms to get to the <UNK> room after billy falls off the jungle gym ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene he tells the guy in a <UNK> shame on you and of course the finale where joanna tells ted she's not taking billy which i found a little hard to swallow why would she go to all that trouble of <UNK> for custody and then just change her mind but this is a small <UNK> regarding a wonderful movie masterfully directed by robert <UNK> and <UNK> performed by a top notch cast a must see
<START> avoid this movie if you are expecting the <UNK> adventure 1972 you may experience nothing more than a case of the this film offers nothing more than two extremely long and drawn out hours of complete boredom br br the cast members act as if they are <UNK> by the <UNK> of a <UNK> of water <UNK> on a bed of an <UNK> the script is totally unrealistic and the film does not even have the feel of a disaster movie in fact everything about this movie is bad with the exception of tom it is unfortunate that such a fine actor got swept away by a <UNK> of <UNK> to appear in such a <UNK> when this movie was being made the <UNK> must have turned over in its <UNK> grave in a sea of shame and shelley winters will rise again from the dead direct from the <UNK> to haunt anyone who <UNK> to see this pathetic movie i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but it really deserves a zero this movie will make you want to avoid or completely turn against water and it will leave a bad taste in your mouth it may even make you want to see jaws 1975 and <UNK> a great white
<START> i really thought this would be a good movie boy was i mistaken for a quick <UNK> b grade acting c grade special effects d grade for the overall movie don't get me wrong the story was pretty good and not <UNK> so an adult too ride along with it the hero is good looking so most women will like it not a total chick flick as it contains some fight scenes and some blood br br but the way it is shot horrible br br the special effects would be better suited for tv on a kids show br br and lastly send some of the actors back to acting school if they ever attended a class there br br trust me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours br br you have been warned
<START> i saw this on television more years ago than i can remember but never forgot the performance of sammy davis jr i just by chance thought to look for it on video this rendition of and <UNK> is a treasure i would love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well i just can't imagine why it is not <UNK> as one of the greatest performances sammy davis jr every gave whoever is responsible for not bringing this to audiences should be ashamed of his her ignorance i will continue to look for it though maybe the <UNK> responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many african american actors
<START> i spotted the dvd on a store near my home and since i'm a cheesy horror movie alien flicks addict i wondered how good it was it even had two award mentions on the cover i don't remember what festival it won so i figured hey this might be good so i bought it for five <UNK> and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews here either people <UNK> the movie to say it was bad or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies <UNK> <UNK> i then played the dvd not thinking about any review i had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at all br br man i <UNK> like being this critical but the movie was genuinely bad ok i'm just going to give out some <UNK> of what i thought br br 1 acting dialog the acting was so confusing sometimes the actors did a decent job but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them the dialog was even worst i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie the talking in between characters seemed off not just bad but far away from the actual happenings in the movie the monologues of the female character although well delivered became boring and annoying in a little while but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the aliens or the infected i wont even comment on that one just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture 2 visuals the strongest aspect in the movie if you forget the awful fx and light flashes they used to <UNK> explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be the camera in car aspect was quite cool actually but they didn't even used the environment to inspire fear or dread they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three infected characters the movie becomes boring in so many scenes 3 sound talk about editing this movie has no problems in showing how <UNK> edited it was from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the alien dialog ah br br so what did i like in the movie spoilers the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot something someone walking in a distant at first i really thought it was me seeing things but when the character realizes that the figures coming towards her were her own reflection i was surprised pretty creepy idea done well apart from that i had an awful time br br and i don't recommend this to anyone not even teen get together because you can't even laugh at this br br i give it a solid 2 only some technical achievements worked here apart from that yeah nothing
<START> silly disney film about a college student who accidentally discovers a <UNK> that makes things invisible not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good still the script is very bad all the jokes flop and the acting is lousy everybody's trying to be funny and they're not a real boring stupid disney film but it was fun seeing kurt russell so young
<START> i kept waiting for the film to move me inspire me shock me me in some way but it <UNK> none of my emotions it just <UNK> along to the end none of the characters seemed very unique or complex they just seemed like actors <UNK> their lines i think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion the only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could it was a waste of talent film their time and mine if there is a message or meaning or genius in this story it certainly is well hidden or i am very dense which i doubt
<START> living just down the <UNK> from <UNK> co i remember this movie well and thought it was great the story seems like something john would do even in real life but there is something that i will always remember most about the movie for those of you who don't live in denver every christmas the city of denver co puts up a fabulous display of lights and <UNK> at the <UNK> center in downtown denver well as it so happened during the filming of this movie a <UNK> scene was needed so it was borrowed from the <UNK> center display with <UNK> by the way someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be and it was reported stolen a frantic search began with law <UNK> for a few days finally someone spoke up and remembered it to the film crew in <UNK> it was returned and put back where it <UNK> as it turns out it wasn't featured all that much in the movie you can barely see it during the christmas show with the children it did create quit a <UNK> though
<START> apparently i am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film i have not seen it since i was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing i remember distinctly br br the was terrifying nightmare inducing terrifying with the creepy music and the little girl and <UNK> running <UNK> away for their lives br br as a kid i also remember the animated <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> down didn't blink an eye <UNK> and the <UNK> it still <UNK> my dreams and i have several friends the same age who also think it was <UNK> creepy maybe we can get a group rate on therapy br br in short one freaky film for its time
<START> i can't say what knowing the source for this movie adds but this is one of my favorite films from paul <UNK> director and co author this is a <UNK> on the shakespeare comedy but utterly removed from the stage without much text <UNK> and star <UNK> make visual a mid life crisis of passion and purpose desperate to re center himself <UNK> <UNK> to a remote greek island where the locals and the island itself <UNK> a little magic with <UNK> julia especially susan sarandon and molly <UNK> this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous and funny it wasn't a big box office hit but whenever it does come to dvd it will sell
<START> this 1955 heist film follows tony le recently released from prison for <UNK> as he <UNK> the robbery of his life he teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe cracker <UNK> from <UNK> played by jules <UNK> who also directed he only directed because he had been <UNK> as a communist in the u s and couldn't work in hollywood the brilliance of this film is the 1 2 hour during the robbery during all this time there is no dialogue and no music only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or <UNK> the safe this <UNK> the suspense and draws you in they get away with several hundred million <UNK> worth of <UNK> but a jewel offered to a dancer by <UNK> brings their <UNK> to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers they set out to get the <UNK> for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake great heist gangster movie but i prefer j p <UNK> films in this genre br br this movie is like some <UNK> i had last night i had gone to a <UNK> restaurant and the <UNK> was made with sugar <UNK> juice instead of sugar it also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the <UNK> leaving it fairly sour which i like the sugar <UNK> juice <UNK> a subtle slightly more <UNK> taste to it than actual sugar and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as i sucked it down 7 5 10 http <UNK> <UNK> com <UNK>
<START> this film like much of their music is either underrated or <UNK> by the casual <UNK> it is terrific and in many ways ahead of its time br br the images are funny disturbing and at the very least engaging br br the music is amazing br br this is not the candy pop sound they are unfortunately associated with this is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt br br head alone should put the <UNK> into the rock and roll hall of fame br br can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there
<START> sandra <UNK> paints a believable picture as the troubled detective though seeing her as a cynical man eating victim turned requires a leap of faith or two the two creepy troubled kids are portrayed adequately by ryan <UNK> and michael pitt br br i do have quite a bit of trouble getting ben chaplin into the <UNK> same problem <UNK> when watching 'the truth about cats <UNK> http us imdb com title i mean when you put an <UNK> into an all american movie shouldn't there at least be a reason to put him there shouldn't there be some story leading up to the fact that an <UNK> is serving as a detective on an american police force shouldn't there be some dialog pointing out and explaining that rather obvious fact or even some jokes about him being that english br br he looks out of place here as he looked out of place in 'the truth about cats <UNK> producers really should take notice it <UNK> and <UNK> the audience at least me nothing wrong with <UNK> acting it's just a matter of making an actor who is <UNK> of <UNK> believable and not putting him somewhere without a good reason or a storyline br br the movie itself well thrillers especially those dealing with solving a complicated crime require some suspension of disbelief this one's no different actually it requires quite a bit more effort than usual in order to make <UNK> smart enough to crack the case despite of all the <UNK> <UNK> her to let go of it some unrealistic <UNK> are being made about the evidence and i'm sure a lot of people who watched it had a few moments of <UNK> on this is highly unlikely under the or even <UNK> you can't brush evidence aside like that to wrap this movie up ' br br like i said reasonably entertaining and watchable just don't use this as required viewing for detective <UNK> there are no <UNK> there
<START> this is definitely a lesser known comedy short from the 1920s the only reason i saw it was because it was on a dvd by <UNK> films featuring non laurel and hardy shorts featuring ollie they are interesting and historically important but also generally average to below average for the style film compared to shorts by chaplin keaton <UNK> and lloyd they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor also the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent dvds i ended up turning off the sound due to the of the music to set the proper mood but despite this they are still worth seeing br br i've gotta be honest about this short it was the last of 8 on this dvd and by the time i got to it i was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts so it is possible the film might be a little better than a 4 but certainly if this is the case no better than a 5 the film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent <UNK> nothing especially interesting and there are certainly much better silent shorts out there
<START> <UNK> the woman is one of the most moving films i have ever seen in my entire life i watched it twice in a row and <UNK> my eyes out br br this silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider viewing audience unfortunately the sole surviving print is so badly <UNK> that most people won't watch it all the way through and they will miss the gem shining underneath the rough this film could use a digital <UNK> to help bring out its beauty but i doubt it will get it from anyone since its main theme is spiritual <UNK> before christ of the family unit and this is not politically correct these days however it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurting from the pain of broken family relationships br br the cast is magnificent especially <UNK> <UNK> who literally <UNK> as <UNK> the daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> the poor girl who gets pregnant and is cast aside theodore roberts as the <UNK> old <UNK> father who destroys everyone around him through pride and handsome lloyd hughes as the son david afraid of his father but really of life itself br br this is a nice film to watch at christmas especially you will not regret being patient and viewing it in its entirety despite its <UNK>
<START> film noir at its best set in the immediate aftermath of wwii 1946 <UNK> depicts the good bad and ugly of that time monty <UNK> kills sam because <UNK> a jew and therefore automatically perceived through <UNK> narrow lens to have been a <UNK> who got out of fighting the war monty doesn't like people like that the truth is that sam was a soldier too but the truth is something which disappears when you're feeling right about the <UNK> of hate you've been immersed in and the world is full of dirty this and thats badly in need of your brand of <UNK> br br monty is a <UNK> in winning <UNK> clothing the losers of wwii had more than their share as well hate filled <UNK> leaders and soldiers as well some of them were hung for war crimes like starting a war of <UNK> br br this movie got its makers in trouble when that other sadistic of america joe mccarthy got his <UNK> going in the early 1950s br br see <UNK> just to see how good an actor robert ryan was the real robert ryan was no monty he was a great if <UNK> under used actor br br see <UNK> and get a taste of the dark side of post wwii america see it to get a taste of the good side of late 40s america as well robert and robert young also play leading roles could have played <UNK> role in fact he did when he played the psychopath in cape fear
<START> the power started off looking promising but soon became boring and tedious to watch the plot is about an ancient aztec doll that takes possession of those who own it the idea is decent enough and this film would have been fairly entertaining had it been done better however after the first ten minutes or so it soon becomes boring we don't get any good death scenes and have to listen to loads of talking at the end one of the possessed men meets his death by melting away in front of two girls but it's not very interesting and definitely not gory br br i wouldn't recommend the power to any horror or slasher fan as there's little to be gained from it
<START> a formula for murder isn't a well known giallo but that isn't to say it's not a very good one the film is directed by <UNK> de martino the man behind cult classics such as the <UNK> and blazing the film was released late on in the giallo cycle but more than stands up to many of the films released around the period in the early seventies despite a lack of logic in some areas the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes <UNK> style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists and a host of well defined characters the film is perhaps not as exciting overall as many other films in the genre but this is more than <UNK> for by the assured way that the central situation is fed to the audience and the tension resulting from that the plot begins by showing a fake priest <UNK> a young girl named joanna before pushing her down a flight of steps we then fast forward several years and the girl is now a woman who is unfortunately in a wheelchair she is being trained for a sports event by craig a man who also has romantic designs on her however his <UNK> isn't met with glee by personal assistant who also has romantic designs on her br br the film features a plot twist half way through that makes up the <UNK> of the movie and while it's not exactly logical it's good to watch and hints that you're in for an interesting movie director <UNK> de martino is clearly not afraid to show a few outrageous gore scenes and the best of which in this film features a priest being <UNK> to death by a spade and i personally wouldn't hesitate to name that sequence as one of my favourite giallo murder scenes the plot can be a little uneven at times but generally the action is very good the director spends what seems like an eternity on the conclusion to the film but it's absolutely packed with tension and the way that it plays out is good in that it takes advantage of all the plot points that have gone before it the musical score taken from <UNK> the new york <UNK> works well in this film also and breaking a giallo tradition de <UNK> film also features some rather good acting performances from cult veteran david <UNK> and christina in her only feature film role overall this film isn't one of the <UNK> <UNK> to come across but its well worth tracking down and comes recommended to fans of this sort of film
<START> even by the standards of most b movies this movie is by far the worst i've ever seen the graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic the ocean water effects are especially laughable including the one scene where they board the mini sub and the water looks like its frozen in place the problems with this film are so numerous that i'll just stop here with the details needless to say i kid you not when i say that even uwe toilet boll himself could do a better job avoid this movie at all cost there are other b grade movies out there that despite being horrible are at least a good way of passing the time by
<START> there are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making br br <UNK> is one of these movies and it should be on anyone's list looking to learn more about the history of cinema br br <UNK> m <UNK> directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a russian <UNK> when the sailors finally <UNK> against their superiors the locals embrace the them and support them things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business what follows is one of the most <UNK> scenes in the history of cinema anyone who has seen the <UNK> and <UNK> knows exactly what i mean br br overall i think this movie raised the bar for film making just as <UNK> did a few years earlier if you do not mind silent films do yourself a favor and see <UNK> br br if you don't like silent films watch <UNK> anyway br br
<START> i was shocked at how good this german version of films such as scream was <UNK> all the modern american efforts at slasher films br br it as what all those films don't likable characters genuine mystery suspense graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack br br this stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years german cinema is going from strength to strength just lately its a shame more people wont go to see such films because they are missing out it is easily available on dvd so even if you hate subtitles i think you should see it it will be one of the best horror films you will see all year
<START> having seen <UNK> documentary on <UNK> visconti i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low but the viewer like me did get <UNK> i faced a need for critical opinion which i generally don't like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally but when i read the reviews already written on this title i also felt a bit confused people sometimes don't know what to criticize therefore to be clear i'll <UNK> this film into two major parts that <UNK> considerably the former one about visconti before his director's career and latter one about visconti the director br br the <UNK> background all the <UNK> the wealth that young <UNK> experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents' divorce we also get a very accurate idea of where <UNK> was brought up as a real count of <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> with access to everything in true <UNK> for instance his father's splendid villa at and other marvelous <UNK> prove that there is also an emphasis on <UNK> crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met <UNK> people left <UNK> who later had impact on his style and message in art that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the <UNK> upbringing a contrast at first sight br br however the part about his director's career which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with just before the director's death in 1976 is poorly executed his movies are not discussed well why because there are very few people who really have something to say franco <UNK> the director remembers the works on la <UNK> <UNK> and that is all right there are also some interviews with franco but later such movies like <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> a <UNK> or <UNK> are mostly discussed by <UNK> <UNK> although i liked the actor in the role of <UNK> i did not like the interviews of his moreover some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to <UNK> in such a documentary there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece there are no interviews with <UNK> cast burt <UNK> a mention about and <UNK> schneider should also be made there is one footage interview with maria that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit franco <UNK> though i appreciate him as a director makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious for instance he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service therefore i say <UNK> and <UNK> br br what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself as a result we may get his own opinion about his works for instance i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself he also <UNK> his health problems after the stroke while filming <UNK> br br i believe it is better to see <UNK> visconti 1999 by <UNK> than this doc although it is shorter and <UNK> as a whole you will get a better idea of the director visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people's emotions and <UNK> into stone 4 10
<START> definitely worth watching br br ten different directors each present a segment based on their favorite opera <UNK> you don't need to be an opera lover to watch this film although of course if you hate opera you're really going to have a bad time with this br br not surprisingly the segments range from brilliant to only fair most of the fuss seems to be over <UNK> contribution whether you think he's brilliant or pretentious his segment won't change your mind br br some of the pieces have a clear narrative others are more a montage of connected images br br none of the pieces is more than 10 minutes or so if you're not happy with what's on the screen wait for the next segment and think about how much culture you're <UNK> up br br keep your eyes open for performances by buck henry beverly <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> <UNK> fonda <UNK> <UNK> and john hurt the buck henry segment alone is worth the price of admission br br
<START> i'm doing a <UNK> on <UNK> the boundaries the female cross <UNK> and am using <UNK> the <UNK> the book as my main text any comments on gender and sexual identity gender and sexual confusion gender as a performance gender as a fiction gender imagery cross dressing as an erotic fantasy and as revolution the effect of the male costume etc etc would be much appreciated but a bit off the point has anyone seen sergio 1987 film vera its about a young lesbian possibly <UNK> cross <UNK> i'm dying to see it because i think it'd be really helpful does anyone know where i might get a copy of it i've tried amazon and a few other sites but no luck
<START> <UNK> q is one of those rare and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling it's bittersweet but wholesome and it's characters are fun and captivating at first i thought the movie would be the cliché <UNK> movie that would bore me after five minutes but was i wrong it made me tear up at times and it's plot was <UNK> making me root for the good guys i loved the movie and still remember it today 9 years later i recommend it highly to anyone and the movie is family oriented so you won't have to worry about <UNK> content truly if disney would show more movies that are up to par as <UNK> q it would be the most popular family oriented channel in the world now if only disney would show it just one more time go <UNK> q
<START> ice the <UNK> br br a virus pulled out of the ice br br just didn't know how to play nice br br if infected you'll kill br br because you are ill br br the cure is to be infected twice br br ice is a great episode one of the <UNK> from season 1 that began <UNK> the show and if you ask me you really couldn't ask for much better throughout the entire series it starts out with an awesome <UNK> which in my opinion is really one of the best <UNK> of the series also a group of scientists in <UNK> have <UNK> something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other now <UNK> and <UNK> are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened as <UNK> says this is either because they are brilliant or <UNK> i take this to mean that they had better be brilliant or else the group soon finds out that the cause of mayhem is a small <UNK> pulled out of the ice core a little worm that gets into the <UNK> and causes violent behavior since the pilot is infected the rest of the show turns to a suspenseful sort of who done it <UNK> thriller as the others begin to suspect each other of being infected this is not helped at all by an overly paranoid doctor <UNK> who is un <UNK> of anyone which we learn early on by the first thing he asks to see everyone's <UNK> to make sure we are who we say we are events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them br br there are a number of things i like about the episode and of course certain characters that i want to <UNK> in the face from this episode as well as a couple <UNK> but most can be attributed to <UNK> caution and not thinking clearly i like bear from the moment i first meet him its a shame he has to die i also like the scene shown from the other <UNK> point of view as <UNK> and <UNK> argue in the other room it gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and for me seems to say maybe we shouldn't assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets as much as <UNK> <UNK> me in this episode i do think that <UNK> was as much to blame for some of the <UNK> actions taken as any i really like <UNK> in this episode first of all she can tackle like a <UNK> <UNK> second i really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let trust and friendship of <UNK> keep her from her judgment i love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and first looks as the picture of the previous group all <UNK> and the birthday presents from them to whoever used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the <UNK> in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says <UNK> buddies this is such great writing a way to say without any words that <UNK> is worried that she may not be able to trust even her very best friend br br unfortunately this <UNK> suspicion leads the group to believe <UNK> to be infected since he murphy's dead body even though they haven't <UNK> him at all to find out for sure that was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is they could easily have solved all the suspicion simply by giving blood but i guess i probably would have acted <UNK> in that situation too but then stupid <UNK> decides that he has to assume <UNK> is infected even though <UNK> willingly <UNK> and then is going willingly to be <UNK> and almost <UNK> <UNK> in the process luckily he sees that it is really <UNK> that is infected and we finally reach a resolution at least as much as you can expect from an x file the government wastes no time in <UNK> the evidence as always happens in these cases and <UNK> is left with yet another frustrating <UNK> case in closing i give ice and easy 10 10 and i leave you with a <UNK> br br we're not who we are it goes no further than this it ends right here right now
<START> the twins effect is the worst movie i've seen not only is the support weak but the characters as well i'm sorry to say to you edison fans but is by far the weakest vampire i've seen in my life i'm sorry edison your role in this movie was disappointing edison does not fight whatsoever in this movie and i'm sure if they didn't have in the movie the plot wouldn't be much different the main plot in the movie is not explained nearly enough and the entire movie focused too much on helen and growing relationship i mean who the hell was and why did they need his blood yeah he's the prince right so what br br certain scenes in this movie were just plain stupid yeah the action was great but the entire outline of it was stupid in one scene towards the end duke says that is the strongest of his brothers yeah it would seem so now that he's full grown why would you wait until he's grown up to attack another scene was with jackie chan one of my personal favorites in the scene jackie asked helen who were the creatures that <UNK> followed them how can you be so naive as to not know that they are vampires people are dying around them with bite marks on their <UNK> surely the news would be on it faster than you can say vampire br br the characters were yet another mistake in the movie helen played by <UNK> <UNK> is the girlfriend of what kind of girl would not be scared of vampires especially if it is your brother's job to kill them i can bet you that you would not find such a brave girl as helen if you searched your whole life helen is annoying bitchy and is a total drama queen in the movie she tries too hard to be different and in the end fails miserably one of the <UNK> and most disturbing characters i've seen in any movie why would you bite someone's neck especially if you're not a vampire it's very odd that her reaction to confession doesn't turn him off played by edison <UNK> is another stupid character in the story how <UNK> for a young actor as himself to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role he does not stand up for himself throughout the movie and does not fight although i'm a fan of edison i wouldn't want a man who lies on the ground the whole time gypsy and reeve are my favorite characters in the movie their love is pure and sweet gypsy is gorgeous and does not try too hard like helen reeve played by <UNK> <UNK> is wise and seems to be the only person that makes sense in the movie a plot failure was the death of reeve the movie had absolutely no substance yet it doomed itself by <UNK> one of the only likable characters another character was duke the story didn't focus much on him and therefore made his desire to obtain rock seem irrelevant br br it's very sad because towards the end of the movie i was forcing myself to watch because i so desperately wanted to see fight the end was so abrupt because the whole time i was expecting so great to happen who's the supposed vampire prince does nothing for the movie and i'm sure if he were taken out the movie wouldn't be much different i highly recommend you to not waste your time on this movie as i have i was greatly disappointed if you're in search of a great movie why not watch lord of the rings or pirates of the <UNK> likeable characters with a well written plot
<START> this movie is not that good at all its pretty stupid pretty annoying and very poorly done i really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film although i didn't hate it as much as them i still found it to be a pretty bad film the only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times and also i feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay what i mean by a little better is that if it had been totally <UNK> not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film instead it isn't but instead what it is now a crappy film the acting is atrocious i felt as if i was watching a couple of teens act for like a halloween show or thrill ride or something the kills are pretty cheap as is the film itself and basically everything else is low class overall this film really is bad and you wouldn't be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film br br 3 8 out of 10 stars
<START> this is the only christopher guest movie that rivals spinal tap and princess bride for sheer entertainment value but somehow never gets near the recognition the plot <UNK> the contestants dogs and their owners as they venture into the world of <UNK> dog ok it's about a dog show the owners truly are characters as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs that's really all there is to it but that makes it funny enough br br you'd never be able to convince me that a mock u about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where levy and o'hara visit larry <UNK> house on tv but that's really all it takes to <UNK> any <UNK> spinal tap was non stop hilarity joke after joke whereas best in show was had a few more <UNK> and by that i mean say 3 minute at most where something <UNK> funny doesn't happen but the big laughs are even bigger br br the casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in uh movies in general parker posey does a fine job in fact her <UNK> directed at ed <UNK> jr and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film br br what's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to <UNK> a plot simple as it was around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction i guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over the top the realism of how pathetic they seem to the <UNK> is what makes it funnier than mighty wind or the uneven <UNK> i actually encounter <UNK> like this now and then if you like <UNK> stuff at all you should definitely own this one
<START> in august days dies marc has given us a sun <UNK> <UNK> documentary style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised <UNK> on <UNK> and <UNK> the dead the beautiful sometimes large scale richly atmospheric 35 <UNK> landscape images nice soundtrack and <UNK> language narration are enchanting as a mood piece if one is content with a <UNK> that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular filmmaker marc and his non identical twin david are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister marc had been <UNK> the life of <UNK> 1940 2001 a <UNK> editor who had been a family friend he felt he was <UNK> with information and had to take a break the break turned into making this film which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with associates thoughts about the spanish civil war the <UNK> season they were experiencing the rugged landscape the <UNK> affection for each other <UNK> and nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they <UNK> out of their van this leads to pursuit of a giant <UNK> and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers in the end david has to go back to <UNK> to be with his daughter and marc has to return to his project and there it ends i found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the <UNK> language with its blend of spanish and french sounding words perhaps linked with this isn't a major film but it <UNK> attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and <UNK> beauty and its way of playing around with genres and <UNK> autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought provoking way br br an official selection of the 2006 new york film festival at lincoln center
<START> if you're in the middle of a <UNK> war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the <UNK> of the civilians to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery the <UNK> and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause and that's just what director anthony <UNK> provided the british with naval war film we dive at dawn after more than 60 years it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated it doesn't help that the class stereotypes which help define the <UNK> men from the officers can be jarring here as in so many other british war films the men <UNK> have thick <UNK> working class accents while the officers speak with an educated that would place them at home in <UNK> finest <UNK> class <UNK> in this movie <UNK> taylor john mills the captain of the submarine sea tiger is clever confident <UNK> aggressive in control good with his men humorous with his peers quick to make a decision and it helps that he's lucky his men are jolly for the most part competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they're on leave after that things get tense quickly br br taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the a new german <UNK> they just miss the ship when it enters the <UNK> <UNK> and heads into the <UNK> taylor the risks and decides the sea tiger will go after it through mine fields anti sub <UNK> and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base after several tense situations the confrontation takes place the sea tiger lets loose six <UNK> but has to dive not knowing if it had done its job after a clever <UNK> taylor a couple of german <UNK> but then realizes there is not enough fuel he plans to <UNK> his sub and surrender when just at the last moment james <UNK> eric portman a <UNK> who had been <UNK> and a loner and who speaks german says there is a small danish <UNK> village that had been a fuel <UNK> he thinks it might still be for the germans the last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the germans long enough to <UNK> in enough fuel to get the sea tiger back to britain this is a wartime propaganda movie so don't expect failure and did the sea tiger actually put the down are the men reunited with their wives and <UNK> did <UNK> have a <UNK> with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once did <UNK> taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book you'll have to see the movie br br there are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies some like <UNK> and <UNK> one of our aircraft is missing and the <UNK> parallel still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious <UNK> clichés others like we dive at dawn were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made still <UNK> can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés the sea <UNK> forcing its way through a sub net was tense the stalking of the and the plotting needed for the <UNK> firing was realistic john <UNK> no nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well handled the fake out <UNK> to make the sea tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic inside the sub as well as out as you could hope for and the battle for the fuel <UNK> was dramatic and exciting we dive at dawn is not a classic war film but it's a well made well acted example of its type and time br br john mills it's worth noting had a long long career especially in the fifties he played in a number of serious minded films looking back at those wwii days he had the quality of showing <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but of also being <UNK> a man england could be proud of as he fought the war top billed in this movie was eric portman a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a <UNK> everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff upper lip mode but portman manages some complexity for his character mills and portman did fine jobs working together on this film
<START> i didn't read the book scarlett and when i watched this mini series i enjoyed it very much and thought it didn't need to be compared to <UNK> the story may <UNK> from the book but who cares its a movie even in the credits its based on the book its not the book the film is clearly under appreciated with the reviews that other people write but can't even spell the main characters names right br br the acting in scarlett i thought was superb <UNK> <UNK> and timothy dalton were excellent they took the characters and gave them there touch now as far as other people go by they compare them to the great vivian leigh and clark gable they obviously did fantastic but the leads in this film are completely different people who have there own acting methods and shouldn't be <UNK> of what people have to say if you wanted certain actors to do well then you should have directed the film i'm sure that other actors would not do as well as these with the chemistry and <UNK> they brought to these roles the supporting cast stood out with there <UNK> and jean smart steals the scenes that <UNK> in with her comedy genius br br the locations in the film were very beautiful and it was just grand to see scarlett go to all those places in the film as she causes trouble and other things also the scene in which scarlett talks to her <UNK> grave it was very dramatic and i thought from then on that there were two great actresses who brought scarlett o'hara to life not just vivian leigh but also <UNK> <UNK> br br the film and the book may <UNK> but you must not take to heart that this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made otherwise you will think that this has to be like gone with the wind and you will not like this film but this is an under rated classic that is unlike <UNK> its its own movie also keep in mind that tomorrow is another day
<START> you know you've got a bad film when you hear that the soundtrack is performed completely on a single cheap <UNK> without any melody or sense of rhythm br br it's hard to see how anyone could take this film seriously even while giving it a bad review this film is way beneath <UNK> br br the continuity of this film is outrageously butchered in one fight scene we the hero wearing and turn a corner with two <UNK> in his hand he <UNK> back only now he has two semi <UNK> in his hands he turns another corner and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands he chases down a <UNK> and comes out suddenly dressed in standard army <UNK> jacket with a shotgun after which he <UNK> the building with yet another automatic rifle or here's one for the books a bus <UNK> into a car at high speed the car goes flying thrown by a gigantic explosion cut to the bus which is completely <UNK> from the same explosion the narrative continuity suffers from an equally numbing sense of <UNK> the bad guys really want to kill the hero obviously but every time they knock him out or otherwise get him in a vulnerable position they suddenly decide they want him to live to see this huh one of the funnier moments of the film is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him then the bad guy decides he's not going to let the two meet after all and this despite the fact that the the villain the hero and his lawyer all know what's going on anyway so the hero writes a note to the lawyer and next we see the note being passed to the lawyer by another prisoner even though we never see the hero give it to him this lawyer btw has complete access to the <UNK> of the in california including its <UNK> computer files huh well but it's a mindless action movie so the action scenes not bad surprisingly unfortunately they happen to be from about a dozen hong kong films made five or ten years previously the opening scene a shoot out in a <UNK> garage actually has shots the composition of which are stolen directly from hard boiled so clearly so that it's a wonder john woo didn't sue for <UNK> br br other hong kong films stolen from include prison on fire island on fire burning paradise police story i ii and iii aka <UNK> i thought i recognized a couple sammo hung clips here as well in other words the actions scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are successful of action scenes from other films br br there's nothing one can do with this film unless one shoots <UNK> and just needs a lot of visual <UNK> that <UNK> be make any sense br br very funny film for all the wrong reasons
<START> why couldn't the end of the movie have been sean <UNK> men fighting the french instead of the germans ever since the french had occupied <UNK> in <UNK> the <UNK> from <UNK> and those of <UNK> were making <UNK> on the french military and <UNK> <UNK> this movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the french had <UNK> the so his followers would not be <UNK> <UNK> and then his followers would have attacked the french to free him br br the movie is still stereotypical of <UNK> between the germans and the americans when the americans shoot the germans their guns even the <UNK> make loud noises create large bloody bullet wounds and their enemies are screaming after being shot when germans shoot at the americans their guns don't make large sounds do not create bloody wounds and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot br br in real life the american rifle was the worst rifle america had ever produce until the early version of the m 16 came along the was hard to maintain not reliable and the rifle <UNK> was always <UNK> the german was one of the world's finest <UNK> we were so impress by it during spanish american war that we made a copy of it and call it the <UNK> rifle br br finally the people of <UNK> must had a word for <UNK> since the french were using them in their <UNK> against <UNK> i didn't like it when they made the feel stupid that there was no word for <UNK> in the <UNK> instead the stated that the europeans had guns on <UNK> that make the ground shake
<START> having just <UNK> the series one dvd collection from my somewhat obsessive brother i was expecting to get through the first couple of episodes and <UNK> it back i have just found myself yelling at the screen for ending the first season on a cliff <UNK> a mere week later and i've watched the entire season where i found the time for this i have no idea br br this show is great it doesn't take itself too seriously it has likeable characters who are well acted and the special effects ignoring the odd tacky puppet here and there are special enough to give it that polished feel at first i didn't realise it was filmed mostly here and it seemed odd to hear so many aussie accents on a sci fi show it was most amusing for the main character john to land back in sydney <UNK> through the first season br br i believe this show's biggest strength is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had they have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explain previous actions and the continue to john's conversations with <UNK> in an amusing and <UNK> way on top of that having watched the entire voyager and next gen series i see little plot rip off so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season i hope the rest of it is as good br br <UNK> is not like any other sci fi that i've enjoyed in the past i heard that the fourth season wasn't as good as the first three and i am now quite annoyed that they cancelled it before the <UNK> i hope that they revive this show with the same actors in either a movie or another series it would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished as i imagine that with a show that's had so much thought put into it to have it <UNK> without adequate warning will leave me feeling robbed br br gotta go now heading back to my brother's place to the 2nd season br br v
<START> considering the subject matter i thought that this film would at least be enjoyable if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece i was wrong i was still waiting for something to happen and it finished i thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition
<START> this two and a half hour long film was shown recently at <UNK> <UNK> university at a 10 <UNK> show there was a <UNK> 1 am show after that but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until 3 30 am the opening scene is of a man walking in a field and it lasts four minutes of movie time it is an ominous sign of what's to come a good minutes more of pretty much the same there is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall standing in the sun it is repeated 15 times with very sparse dialogue occasionally these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills such as a close up of female <UNK> shown for one full minute of film time audience crowd laughing in the last 20 seconds as to say what's the message the story resembles <UNK> novel the <UNK> brothers in which a <UNK> falls in love with a woman of easy morals in one of the rare <UNK> in which the crowd was laughing more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening was when the statement by a british tourist that he couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at <UNK> miles an hour was translated by the <UNK> with automatic switch of <UNK> of measure from english system to <UNK> system to they couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 <UNK> per hour what was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that alot of money has been spent on it this was no film kitchen 8 <UNK> experiment it was carefully planned structured acted <UNK> yet i got so little out of it some comments on the excruciating detail such as the of a key chain on a door just opened okay it was noted but what was the purpose some people in the audience walked away after the first hour the rest remained out of curiosity there must be something happening at the end there never was and maybe that's what the film is about all the movies at the theater are action packed this one wants to be different there is nothing happening
<START> i love this film there is something for everyone it if funny <UNK> passionate and dramatic the mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but want to be a part of i must admit that i am slightly biased as colin <UNK> is my favourite actor and so nothing that he does is wrong in my eyes but in this film his tremendous acting talent is apparent and it is <UNK> even more by the beautiful acting of his co star long the problems that their love affair suffers makes it ironically more believable and the simple features like the contrast between the colours of <UNK> and clothes alone makes this film all the more enchanting i defy anyone that cannot be moved by this story i find it enchanting and have watched it at least ten times since i bought the film a week ago
<START> frankly i just enjoy watching james <UNK> wonderful actor with such simplicity you know exactly what he's thinking a true pro br br i have watched the show from the very beginning and found it different that's something that is unique in hollywood a new idea not a 3rd version of a current hit show br br i also find the show fun and exciting i like the pacing you're never bored i especially like the mystery in each episode the way it unfolds i am a big mystery fan and have read a lot of the great mysteries but i find the stories in the show well written and the outcome is rarely obvious also extremely interesting to me probably because i am not a <UNK> is the different cons that the come up with i was fascinated by the number of schemes that people have come up with to rob las vegas the music i like the music at the top of the show absolutely perfect for the show sets the tone and atmosphere just marvelous and of course there is james <UNK>
<START> finally got to see this movie last weekend what a disappointment it barely reaches made for tv level given the list of actors i would have expected something <UNK> more sophisticated the movie lacks a good story well actually any story for that matter it has no credibility instead lots of predictability save yourself the money and the time
<START> this is horrific no really this is bar none the absolute worst worst i hesitate to even call it a <UNK> movie it is a ninety minute visual root <UNK> the plot is practically non existent a mad scientist who looks like the <UNK> from 'the <UNK> a woman in his secret lab a lawn chair in what i think may be a garage via an <UNK> of within hours she <UNK> a full grown monster who then goes on a rampage thats the whole movie the death scenes these are poorly set up take forever and the acting how can you mess up screaming the victims stand there while the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> freak advances on them and proceeds to <UNK> <UNK> them for about three days the sets are cheesy the lighting for most of the movie consists of a single yes a big <UNK> <UNK> the sound quality is poor <UNK> only about 40 words of dialogue for the entire movie and the acting is <UNK> described as wooden footage is shamelessly recycled to pad out the movie and the special effects would make any bbc sci fi production shake their head and <UNK> they didn't even try the <UNK> is some <UNK> in a 3 halloween rubber mask with a few <UNK> slapped on in its encounter with the lone cop of the movie the cop fires invisible bullets that apparently travel so slow the monster can dodge them at five <UNK> don't see this movie no really thats not a dare don't see this movie the director should be shot the writer should be <UNK> to a giant rock where his <UNK> will be <UNK> every morning by ed wood enough <UNK> and there could be a sequel don't let it happen
<START> this movie won a special award at cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why a few spoilers but for the ending you'll have to watch the movie a simple story in <UNK> on the eve of war between russia and germany in <UNK> ii <UNK> <UNK> is in love with boris <UNK> but they have a <UNK> when she learns that he has <UNK> in the army boris leaves for the front before <UNK> can tell him she loves him boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to <UNK> or his family mark <UNK> cousin rapes <UNK> who feels <UNK> to marry him <UNK> and <UNK> by the cowardly mark <UNK> <UNK> to the hope that someday boris will return superb camera work and wonderful set pieces by director for anyone interested in film technique another movie by i am cuba has at least two superb set pieces one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral <UNK> through the streets of <UNK> rises two stories to a <UNK> factory tracks though the window and follows the <UNK> down a long long <UNK> all without a cut superb acting particularly by and as <UNK> uncle that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement a <UNK> romantic movie with a heart stopping performance by this movie is frequently linked with the other russian classic <UNK> of a soldier
<START> this is better then the first the movie opens up with sheriff sam then sam and anne pack there <UNK> up and head to the while jack <UNK> along br br people are shot get glass through <UNK> get <UNK> by get stabbed with <UNK> eyes <UNK> out head explosions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shoved into faces <UNK> throats <UNK> to death killed by <UNK> arms are ripped off <UNK> by anti freeze <UNK> down <UNK> hit in face with <UNK> and pans fingers <UNK> bitten off <UNK> through mouths bitten on the neck exploding people <UNK> <UNK> and shoved in br br the <UNK> are hilarious they put it into a <UNK> and turn it on then it says <UNK> was <UNK> they put in in a <UNK> thing and it gets burnt br br this is just a great movie then they start thinking of other ways to kill it and the <UNK> replies <UNK> not <UNK> br br it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this br br 10 out of 10 stars
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast well everyone except william h macy who could have <UNK> the role played by mr stone the team doctors or the <UNK> selling <UNK> if you're a fan of the foul mouthed there are some great profanity laden knock down drag out put down phrases you can try out on two faced friends and way ward lovers the film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere especially during the first two hours it even features some mtv <UNK> music video scenes br br any given sunday 12 16 99 oliver stone al pacino cameron diaz jamie foxx dennis quaid
<START> one of the problems with popular culture especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s is that mass media especially television is usually about four years behind <UNK> media primarily music many people think the generation remained important throughout the 1970s actually it was all over at <UNK> in 1970 by 1972 <UNK> rock or the had moved east to england and led black <UNK> and david <UNK> early metal heads and the so called <UNK> ' who were all <UNK> and <UNK> not neither in a darkly different vein was charles <UNK> <UNK> ' br br this obvious pilot for a television show that thankfully was never picked up by the networks is attempting to come to terms with a culture that was already as <UNK> as <UNK> flowers the script must have been lying around a few years by the time it was produced writer had already achieved recognition for tough mafia revenge tales and the cultural references are all to easy rider and <UNK> 1969 the music <UNK> on the soundtrack is actually earlier 1966 <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> heat and sly and the family stone had <UNK> this kind of folk pop into oblivion br br the movie is about a middle class family that goes on the road in order to meet hippies wow man it's a <UNK> mind blowing happening of a bag however politics count for nothing vietnam some place in asia right br br this average meaning stale and vacuous tv movie is only redeemed by jeff <UNK> surprisingly mature performance as the young college drop out who convinces his parents and grandma to hippie america all the rest of the performances are standard tv fair by standard tv actors of the time the director <UNK> himself of some nice location cinematography but otherwise the film is a poor way to spend 90 minutes br br i knew it was all over when <UNK> remarks of a young runaway who tells the other characters they are not really there she's a <UNK> <UNK> wow far out <UNK> br br a couple extra points for being <UNK> bad it's funny ' but if you don't care about the <UNK> tv version of the <UNK> stay away
<START> if you really loved <UNK> you will find quite disappointing the story those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett but let me say that considering the novel nothing good could came out of this br br i've read <UNK> more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs mitchell did for the film it took me some time to understand how good the ending was scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover <UNK> since she always got what she wanted but there was no kiss in the end br br then alexandra <UNK> came to fix this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be and of course describing in detail how exactly she gets <UNK> back even when she had an important affair with someone else nothing could have been further from mrs mitchell mind i am sure br br the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending br br if margaret mitchell could came to live again she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after <UNK> br br sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not <UNK> fault isn't it is it any good if i don't compare it to the original maybe sorry to say i don't really care br br i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's <UNK> work otherwise don't even try
<START> this production was quite a surprise for me i absolutely love obscure early 30s movies but i wasn't prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story if by any chance you're not convinced in the first half hang in there for the finale of course you must look at the blatant racism as being purely <UNK> a fascinating viewing experience but i think the <UNK> <UNK> is not available on video dvd yet watch your <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the italian job is a caper movie done by the numbers riding on the back of every caper cliche it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie <UNK> by about the end of the month br br the biggest problem is that the italian job possesses no imagination at all i've seen it all before and done better then the acting is fine the cinematography is completely acceptable but this film breaks absolutely no new ground br br let's <UNK> off the cliches br br old school criminal father figure and his <UNK> br br another gang member jealous of <UNK> br br a double cross br br only bad guys use guns while good guy criminals don't have to br br good criminals always <UNK> the bad guys br br and that's about the first fifteen minutes everything is so predictable even the heist and car chase scenes supposedly the highlight of the movie seem pretty ordinary this is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so i already knew what to look for br br for me a caper film works only if it has an element of realism that maybe just maybe it could be pulled off without relying on a <UNK> ex <UNK> or just because moments parts of the italian job just throws that out the window with computers doing things that computers can't do the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving especially going down the stairs and not one single police car <UNK> to street explosions <UNK> driven <UNK> or even a low flying helicopter must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response br br the acting is passable with the crew seth green jason <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> being at least fun to watch mark <UNK> is just too smarmy as the nice guy hero while <UNK> <UNK> is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range donald sutherland is a class act as always and shows up <UNK> <UNK> every moment they are together br br overall this is a pretty uninteresting film given the imdb ratings it's the girls that really love this film which i can understand to some extent but there are such better caper films out there even the <UNK> of the recent <UNK> eleven <UNK> the non event that is the italian job br br spoiler br br at the conclusion take a moment to think about what is going to happen to <UNK> character are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise especially since it would appear to be long and painful he didn't deserve that <UNK> creep that he was br br end spoiler
<START> in a time of predictable movies in which abound violence cheap romance and melodrama it is delightfully surprising to find such a strange movie the plot itself is compelling and the actors are excellent especially alan <UNK> if you want to watch a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions a movie that will surprise you in good or bad dark for you and if you're not convinced believe me that alan performance is well worth it especially at the end ladies
<START> to be honest i've never been to the <UNK> or even africa and after watching the made for television movie heart of darkness i do not think i'd want to the movie completely <UNK> the book to the highest level possible though the book was not the best i have read after watching the movie i seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more nicolas <UNK> the director of the movie did a horrible job portraying joseph <UNK> <UNK> into a movie i give <UNK> some credit for trying to attempt the impossible by making the book into a movie but this may not have been the job for him the movie was <UNK> to express any part of the <UNK> other than the <UNK> of the plot the set and scenery also lacked the beauty conrad portrayed of africa in the book in the book <UNK> had seen so many great wonders but in the movie you did not get that same experience no i'm not <UNK> everything on the director the acting in the film was just terrible all of the actors were dull and uninteresting throughout the whole movie i felt as if the actors were not putting forth any emotions as if they were reading from the script the entire time tim roth who plays <UNK> did not portray <UNK> sense of adventure for his journey into the <UNK> well <UNK> journey to find <UNK> was supposed to but i didn't experience that in the movie i would not recommend watching this movie especially if you have read the book already it does not come close to doing justice for joseph <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> words capture the reader and take them on the journey with <UNK> on his quest to find mr <UNK> where as the film did not a great <UNK> but a very poor film heart of darkness the movie is based on the book written by joseph conrad also called heart of darkness
<START> over all it was a real good movie though all the actors besides jones sucked by the time i was half was through it i was really getting tired of seeing only change i would have made to it would to have more flash backs possibly with the real <UNK>
<START> everything about this movie is awful br br you can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible you can't however <UNK> how bad it's going to be br br we start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like doesn't <UNK> the slightest emotion br br what then starts seems to be one of two separate stories the first half of the movie consists of the going around competing in paid midnight fights with other ethnic groups the always win of course because they apparently lift <UNK> and have respect it is in these scenes that we first get to see the degree of bad acting editing scripting and hatred for the people who <UNK> this film br br eventually the main character and his mate get sent to prison the entire prison part of the movie is unrelated to what i assume is the plot and consists of a bunch of fights br br once out of prison 3 years for murder the main character and his mate reunite with the they then go to the other side of town and try to lay low because apparently everyone wants to kill them br br soon the get set up for the rape of another gang members girl and run around town fighting off <UNK> of different gangs this point of the movie can be compared to an <UNK> game as the simply run around and fight off enemies who seemingly get worse and worse as the movie goes on br br anyway the movie ends with some massive climatic fight scene in which the remaining the two main characters take on every gang they've fought so far apparently the other gangs don't have a problem <UNK> to take on the remaining the <UNK> don't mind <UNK> after about a million more people get beaten up by the <UNK> brothers the movie ends with the main characters heading home they don't make it home however because they are burned to death by the the thousands of angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere br br this movie may be more like a computer game then a movie because that would explain how two guys can take about a million punches to the face from a million different people who the majority of the time are twice their size br br there are also <UNK> more stupid <UNK> events in this movie such as an asian fighting off his own gang and taking a <UNK> to the head just to let the get away br br like someone else mentioned this movie isn't so bad its funny it's just so bad
<START> jonathan <UNK> is such a character oriented director that to see him pulling a brian de palma which is to say <UNK> hitchcock it is nearly predictable when he fails to work up much suspense within this tepid mystery working from a screenplay by david from murray <UNK> novel <UNK> attempts to strike a <UNK> somewhere between alan j <UNK> paranoia dramas and hitchcock's <UNK> thrillers roy <UNK> stars as a retired secret agent mourning the murder of his wife who is now busy <UNK> bad guys who are out to kill him takes off right away but the script is full of flimsy threads and any excitement dies out quickly there's a visually impressive climax at falls but <UNK> gets little out of his cast and even less out of this <UNK> of a story from
<START> <UNK> is pretty interesting sci fi no major budget very few special effects but decent acting and a storyline of global doom is enough to sustain viewing an <UNK> the atmosphere and thrust the earth into an <UNK> closer to the sun global warming rapidly becomes unbearable a determined <UNK> cop casper van <UNK> goes all out to save the world from certain <UNK> as the rising <UNK> are devastating the pressure is on to save mankind from this <UNK> catastrophe as well as protect his daughter nurse ex wife and tv reporter girlfriend the cast includes <UNK> von <UNK> amanda crew and vincent <UNK>
<START> some giant <UNK> are on a submarine and kill everybody two months later some marines and the scientists in charge of the <UNK> project go to the sub to retrieve their <UNK> after finding 200 dead bodies the marine commander tells the doctor i need to know if there's anything down here that could be a danger to my men uh gee ya think she refuses to tell him what is down there <UNK> need to know <UNK> that pretty well <UNK> it up one of the scientists is apparently some sort of idiot <UNK> real heavy on the idiot light on the <UNK> he's given the task of <UNK> the lights he finds the control <UNK> for the lights cuts a wire and <UNK> like a <UNK> then he does it again then he takes a hammer and <UNK> the control <UNK> to pieces which causes all the lights on the submarine to start working br br and so it goes apparently this was made in sweden i'm not sure if the <UNK> have a really weird sense of humor or if they're just really awful movie makers i'm inclined to think they're awful movie makers if you guessed that there's a huge explosion at the end of this thing well sorry but that's on a need to know basis so i can't tell you br br if you've absolutely got to see a giant <UNK> movie let me suggest tail <UNK> which is a cheesy and fun movie about <UNK> on a plane or bugs which is a fairly descent b movie about <UNK> in a tunnel look at this movie as an absolute last resort oh it's watchable it's hard to turn it off just because of the sheer <UNK> of it but that's about all it's got going for it
<START> the worst movie i've seen in years and i've seen a lot of movies acting is terrible there is no plot whatsoever there is no point whatsoever i felt robbed after i rented this movie they recommended it to me mind you a disgrace for terrible movies stay away from this terrible piece of c p save your money
<START> the scarlet coat is about arnold <UNK> his country but he really isn't in the movie too much the main focus is on major <UNK> <UNK> and major andre micheal <UNK> <UNK> steals the movie as a officer and a gentlemen also as a to as tries to <UNK> who is the man <UNK> to the british <UNK> has to deal with the british the dr o <UNK> george sanders who watches his every move and love anne francis this is a very enjoyable movie
<START> everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'the <UNK> endless nature footage bad acting aside from these elements this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases is considered a cult classic br br jackson <UNK> and jackie <UNK> play pretty well off each other there's also a three minute <UNK> solo that shows off skill behind the <UNK> not too bad if i do say so myself br br the last ten minutes of the <UNK> are its saving grace the ending still <UNK> me to this day this can also sport a short lived plus in that an early john carl does the special effects some may know him from films like and <UNK> the 13th part 7 he directed both these films all in all this isn't a movie everyone will find something redeeming in in fact on a hollywood level this can rank right up there with one of the <UNK> most amateurish efforts but for that handful yet very loyal of slasher movie fans in the world even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiven
<START> a review i have put off for far too long br br <UNK> 2001 is one of the best science fiction films made to date if not the very best stanley kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works and although it is misunderstood by many and respectively underrated it is considered one of the best films of all time and i'll have to agree back in 1968 no one had done anything like this before and no one has since it was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then and seeing how the effects hold up today it is no wonder as to why the film still looks marvelous after almost forty years take note cgi people through the use of large <UNK> and realistic lighting kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid this aspect alone almost single <UNK> created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects i can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space like it is in reality not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood and it works <UNK> br br aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film the music played all classical compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space <UNK> br br the story while seemingly simple is profound <UNK> several mysterious black <UNK> are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film what are they where did they come from what do they do these are all questions one asks <UNK> while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way while most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story each individual will have to decide what it means to them any way one decides to answer these question results in profound <UNK> it's not left entirely up to interpretation but in some aspects it is experience it for more <UNK> the end result is quite chilling no matter your personal solution br br while it is a long film and sometimes slows down it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man it's not a subject that would have <UNK> well in a shorter film faster paced feature those with short attention <UNK> need not apply br br last but not least is the epitome of a <UNK> antagonist hal <UNK> the computer never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence which reminds me for a film with such profound ambition and execution there is surprisingly little dialogue another sign of kubrick's genius br br all in all one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made a personal favorite everyone must see this film at least once br br very highly recommended
<START> this is not your run of the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases the episodes so far are more realistic and intelligent br br if you are looking for something with a lot of butt kicking rambo style cop story you will not find it here br br i gave it a 9 i wish this series lives long morse is excellent
<START> sure it has its pretentious moments it plays like art house live action <UNK> but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor <UNK> films are always a problem but i have always had a keen interest in them i will now rate the segments <UNK> br br nicolas <UNK> un in <UNK> this segment may very well spoil the film for some people because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch it is difficult to follow mostly because it tries to <UNK> to a clear plot a hackneyed one at that the photography is <UNK> the best thing about it is the bit of lesbian <UNK> that it never does enough with this segment made me very nervous about continuing 2 10 br br charles la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an unclear segment but it hardly matters the film has the best cinematography of the bunch mainly because it is in a stunning black and white the segment is <UNK> and beautiful 7 10 br br jean luc godard i chose to brave this much <UNK> film for the godard and altman segments with godard i was much more impressed than i thought i would be i can't claim to have seen all that many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen but judging from what i have seen this may be his best work since the 60s it is the funniest segment in this film and the most artistically accomplished bravo jean luc 9 10 br br <UNK> temple <UNK> a very funny segment it is also quite predictable still this story about a husband and wife who are cheating on each other at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long complex tracking shots that depend on precisely timed choreography from the actors it also has a great self <UNK> joke about <UNK> films themselves the final scene is very weak 7 10 br br bruce <UNK> die <UNK> this short segment involves too lovers in i think <UNK> it is pretty with some nice shots of <UNK> flying about the city it is slight but nice 7 10 br br robert altman les not one of the better segments unfortunately this is more of a music video than a concept short film it involves the <UNK> of an insane asylum attending a theatrical performance the music and images work well together so at least i can give it credit for being a good music video 7 10 br br <UNK> somewhat unfortunate for <UNK> segment this segment is very similar to it as you might assume from my <UNK> this one struck me much more it is about a young man and his girl going to las vegas on a <UNK> voyage 8 10 br br ken russell <UNK> <UNK> maybe the most visually striking segment it plays in a fantasy world more than in reality it is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel 8 10 br br derek <UNK> le <UNK> i have heard a lot about <UNK> and this is the first piece of filmmaking i have seen from him hopefully i'll see more in the future this one is also music but it is better than altman's it mainly concerns an old woman remembering her younger days the editing and the use of different film <UNK> to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful 8 10 br br bill <UNK> i the sad clown possibly one of the most famous <UNK> particularly memorable from an episode of seinfeld this serves as the material <UNK> each and the finale it is simple and effective 7 10 br br overall i give it a solid 7 10 it isn't anywhere near as bad as you've heard
<START> intriguing premise should have been a 20 minute short that's how long it would take his <UNK> parents to think hmm we lost one son and never found him who is about his age and he looks like our remaining son oh yes and he's a runaway hmm but no this is the most clueless family in history and the conclusion while trying to jerk tears manages only to <UNK> more <UNK> of disbelief
<START> a good entertainment but nothing more in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones this provides us a good a conventional story but it's always a pleasure to see robert mitchum with his legendary although he isn't as fit as in the forties or the fifties and don't forget david carradine is the son of john carradine
<START> an extremely down to earth well made and acted <UNK> western no <UNK> up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a <UNK> hustler and his <UNK> in the 60's and 70's west but hats off particularly to slim <UNK> for giving what i think was his signature performance especially given the fact that he had been a <UNK> clown in real life his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ups and downs of the hard <UNK> <UNK> life and the psychological <UNK> that so frequently <UNK> such a life style he and mr coburn teamed up extremely well as partners not only on the circuit itself but also in the real world outside the <UNK> also check out anne archer as <UNK> native american love interest in the latter part of the movie must have been one of her first roles br br not as flashy perhaps as junior <UNK> but equally heart rendering and <UNK> in its portrayal thanks to the <UNK> western channel for showing this true <UNK> of an under rated movie from time to time
<START> to start off i'm easily pleased i'm in no way a real critic and movies that authentic critics friends family and <UNK> may find awful may even be fun for me to watch br br not this one however br br i got it since it was the <UNK> wesley snipes movie in my dvd store i like snipes but this was a let down br br bad story bad actors continuity <UNK> crappy sound depressing locations a pseudo cool snipes i really had to force myself to finish the movie br br they even left some <UNK> in the shots where a car was supposed to come to a stop br br and i'm not talking about small production company young director low budget kind of bad where you may ignore some mistakes because you feel sympathy br br a wanna be block buster action movie that disappoints like no other in a long time
<START> from a bare description of the <UNK> major plot elements one might think it's a <UNK> western of the 60s or 70s br br our hero is a <UNK> killer and <UNK> br br the love interest is a single mother whose <UNK> husband abandoned her and their child br br twice our criminal hero is <UNK> released by authorities in return for some good deed and this is presented as a <UNK> act br br the only acts which are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of one's family and the betrayal of a criminal associate br br the hero tries to go straight but turns back to a life of crime after he can't get a job br br the hero is on the run from both a <UNK> <UNK> and a criminal gang br br the hero's final redemption is accomplished by <UNK> a man with his bare hands and <UNK> his body over a cliff br br and the good bad man ends the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and riding off alone into the mexican desert never presumably to pay for his life of crime br br just goes to show you that there is nothing new under the sun br br of course the <UNK> gate doesn't display quite the cynicism or moral <UNK> of its <UNK> the hero's redemption is set up when he <UNK> to the <UNK> after reading a passage from the bible can't quite imagine clint eastwood doing that br br the <UNK> gate an excellent movie by any standard and hart was a very fine actor not given to the broad <UNK> often used to convey emotion in the days before sound br br 9 10
<START> want a great recipe for failure take a crappy <UNK> political plot add in some weak completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known let <UNK> for a week the amount of time probably spent making this trash br br the result is this movie ' a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and <UNK> low places never before conceived br br this movie utterly blew <UNK> at my face for its entire run time words cannot convey how painful it was to watch this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of this is not <UNK> 9 from outer space ' this is a long boring and sad waste of time this <UNK> is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen it <UNK> me when i realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this tripe if you can call it acting but then again when you have poor direction poor writing poor everything acting is the last thing to criticize br br this movie is like a huge disgusting turd that you <UNK> to quickly <UNK> out of existence <UNK> that a friend or loved one might somehow see it i really wish i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not <UNK> the minds of aspiring filmmakers thank you robert for giving me <UNK> respect for every other movie i have ever seen you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and or boring
<START> two hands is a highly enjoyable aussie crime caper which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments with very funny characters and situations to give the film the right balance and feel the comedy of the film occurs naturally and the laughs haven't been set up too <UNK> haven't been too worked at it really is very funny thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast and that each actor actress <UNK> and can relate to the aussie humor they portray it very well and very realistically of course they're helped out immensely by a fantastic script by writer director <UNK> jordan i was reading another review of this film by an american who had seen it and he heavily <UNK> it basically passing it off as a pulp fiction clone i think that that's just rubbish this film isn't trying to be pulp fiction the feel and style of each of this excellent films are totally opposite without wanting to sound superior or arrogant i think to fully understand this film the humor the sincerity the characters etc you have to be australian or at least understand the culture which the other guy obviously didn't have the <UNK> clue about some americans whose reviews of certain non american films seem ignorant to and have trouble <UNK> anything that isn't an american product it's a real shame because this is a really great film the love story featured between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real sincere and sweet way i'm very proud to have this film in my collection 4 5 out of 5
<START> i watched this movie when it was released and being really young and not too much into cinema it was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences i ever had and it really left a mark inside me at first i didn't quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary between past and present as the movie presents them to the viewer br br years after i first watched i managed to watch it again and this was the time that i fell in love with 'the english <UNK> it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever made br br anthony made an absolutely stunning film all the locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions inside you br br of course the music of the film is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it br br but personally the best thing was the fragile performance that ralph <UNK> gave in this masterpiece he plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with <UNK> <UNK> opens up his heart and <UNK> into this <UNK> affair br br the most heart breaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt <UNK> is carried by towards the cave of <UNK> and she wears the that he bought her she says 'i always wore it i always loved <UNK> and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him br br juliette <UNK> is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the oscar she won br br overall this is a film that anybody who <UNK> himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives
<START> spoilers ahead br br great <UNK> were still a few years away but this one was certainly good with lots of good matches and one great match br br <UNK> was always at their best at <UNK> i'm glad their last <UNK> <UNK> i refuse to include the other version was a win over the <UNK> connection i liked the gag of andre never <UNK> in br br few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat mr perfect for some reason <UNK> feat was never recognized or the fact that he did it pretty easily br br the hart win over the <UNK> was the <UNK> in <UNK> history including the 24 9 second match between king kong <UNK> and s d jones br br i'm glad jake and <UNK> got to fight at <UNK> this made up for the fact that the <UNK> had to be put on hold for so long br br i expected the big <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to heat up but the <UNK> just <UNK> him as good as <UNK> was as a <UNK> he was just great as a face he was always intense and obviously loved his job br br if the warrior just had a better work <UNK> and maybe tried to learn to <UNK> he would have been a great <UNK> champion br br worth a watch especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about and the tag team matches are all very exciting
<START> i am a german student so sorry for eventually mistakes i'm working on it br br the <UNK> very interesting converted and with effective sound effects <UNK> <UNK> action of the drama <UNK> in no way from the horrible bad actors <UNK> and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better just the typical slasher genre with in this case very odd action many by plays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark create weirdness and let <UNK> the senses of actions and the point mere for sure its an hit for slasher fans but not for me but although the interesting style of cinematography and <UNK> use of light is turned out well br br so not the best one
<START> this quirky and watchable film is the story of a <UNK> dentist who starts out on his mission or <UNK> to fight tooth <UNK> in the back and of <UNK> from northern ireland via new jersey the main character sees his <UNK> as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm <UNK> discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist which adds to the hilarity as his grand plans unravel and gradually fall to pieces as he goes from disaster to <UNK> in the <UNK> on the back of a <UNK> <UNK> bike or his er mobile dental unit we never get to meet his wife nor the rich <UNK> who is <UNK> the ill <UNK> mission but we do get a solid display from lewis fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very believable performance as the <UNK> dentist who is <UNK> by the innocent but sexy 18 year old female lead who <UNK> along on for the <UNK> ride br br this film is not for everyone and i can understand why it wasn't pushed by the suits it's a low budget sometimes charming always <UNK> mildly amusing and instantly forgettable film that sets out with low expectations and almost succeeds
<START> it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time this movie simply <UNK> <UNK> influenced late 60s italian cinema so pseudo serious and sexually free <UNK> settings and dreamy music make this a visual and <UNK> delight plus we get the lovely <UNK> <UNK> surely at her very best looking the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the <UNK> amidst the towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming <UNK> of the time you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course <UNK> a twist in the proceedings it might have been better if <UNK> <UNK> didn't look quite so odd with his red hair and twisted facial expression he does well though and has many silent moments where <UNK> is <UNK> and he has to show a mixture of love and hate not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different this is certainly that
<START> and are part of an dying breed of political film makers the swedish population should appreciate that they try to <UNK> the truth when the government and media <UNK> <UNK> and cover up the events surrounding the <UNK> meeting in <UNK> it is absolutely heartbreaking to see how these innocent kids have been abused and drugged by the swedish police and convicted to prison in political trials for sending text messages and as revenge for others actions the only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it will not reach the broad masses in sweden as it will only be shown it theaters and not be released on video or aired on television br br the political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insight into complex issues and has a role to play as an <UNK> of the masses
<START> if you have ever <UNK> in a house you didn't know or if you saw the original and enjoyed it then this will be a good choice ignoring the reviews and what was posted here i went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teen this movie has of course changed some of the original story to relate to todays teens such as the babysitter is in trouble for going over on her cell phone minutes and has to take on a <UNK> job to pay her bill however it sticks to the original story line pretty well if you can relate to the babysitter not knowing the house and it's usual pops and cracks it is quite suspenseful when the killer is shown he is very creepy and you find yourself yelling at the girl to get out of the house if you have never <UNK> or been in a situation like this then you probably will not be able to relate and will not like it it's all about understanding her fear
<START> this is a terrible movie and i'm not even sure why it's so terrible it's ugly for one with that trendy 1970s visual style that maybe seemed like a good idea at the time but which now <UNK> one to instantly recognize a film from that time period as being a 70s product the film <UNK> the story and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit but the songs sound lifeless on screen but mostly the movie sucks because of the wan performance of lucille ball who you'd think would be able to make something of this larger than life character if anyone could she <UNK> through the movie like a terrified actress <UNK> on her opening night and the film sinks with her even <UNK> arthur who i bet was hilarious in the best friend role <UNK> can't breathe any life into this stinker br br avoid at all costs br br grade d
<START> let me tell you a story br br one day on the streets of <UNK> a film director <UNK> into a male prostitute and decided that the world just had to know his story because you know he's <UNK> and he takes his shirt off a lot and so on br br this film is the result of his revelation repulsive <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but of course filled with pretty guys with their <UNK> showing if this is your idea of a good film then enjoy if not avoid it like the plague br br it's put me off ever going to <UNK> that's for sure
<START> i was <UNK> as well here i was expecting all sorts of man eating and what the hell do you get br br an hour and a half of nothing but awkward <UNK> with some weird guy who isn't weird enough to be scary br br i thought there was no way 5 could be too much for a movie br br damn i was <UNK> wrong it was very hard to watch the whole thing br br don't fool yourself its not so good that its bad its not even that kind of movie br br its nothing an hour and a half of absolutely nothing br br piece of crap
<START> this has to be one of if not the greatest mob crime films of all time every thing about this movie is great the acting in this film is of true quality master acting skills make you actually believe he is italian the cinematography is excellent too probably the best ever this movie was great and i have the brain capacity of an earth worm
<START> oh yeah this one is definitely a strong <UNK> to win the questionable award of worst 80's slasher ever made the prey has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick a routine derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before and better <UNK> characters and terrible performances a complete lack of gore and suspense fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee apart from the seemingly endless amount of national <UNK> stock footage which i'll expand upon later this film is shameless enough to include a complete <UNK> <UNK> and two occasions where characters tell jokes that aren't even remotely funny the set up is as <UNK> as it gets with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with <UNK> voice over human screams fast forward nearly forty years later when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axe whacked by something that <UNK> heavily off screen this ought to be enough information for you to <UNK> that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained <UNK> around ever since enter three <UNK> twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds unaware of course they are sitting <UNK> for the stalking and <UNK> killer the prey is an <UNK> boring film apparently it was shot in 1978 already but nobody wanted to <UNK> it up until 1984 and it isn't too hard to see why in case you would <UNK> out all the content that is actually relevant this would only be a short movie with a running time of 30 minutes possibly even less there's an <UNK> large of nature and <UNK> footage sometimes of animals that i think don't even live in that type of area and they seem to go on forever the only thing missing in fact is the typical national <UNK> narration providing educational information regarding the <UNK> <UNK> animals in their own natural are undeniably nice to look at but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy 80's slasher movie for crying out loud the last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile with some potent killing sequences and fine make up effects on the monster who turns out to be <UNK> from the <UNK> family movies but still silliness <UNK>  the scene with the <UNK> is too stupid  and the final shot is just laugh out loud retarded as mentioned above the prey easily makes my own personal list of worst 80's slashers alongside <UNK> with fear <UNK> deadly games don't go in the woods hollow gate the stay awake and <UNK>
<START> this show <UNK> me it takes up <UNK> on nick at <UNK> that could be reserved for the fresh prince or george lopez even full house and <UNK> they're all better than home improvement first off the mother jill <UNK> me so much she is an whiny baby and i really despise her brad is a fat <UNK> and he is annoying too and the youngest brother i don't even know his name i don't notice him at all that's probably not the actor's fault though it's probably the <UNK> tim is just a stupid ass although jill is definitely my least favorite i don't like any of them the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy as the middle child he is still a <UNK> little brother but an older brother and i like his fun character the other star goes to al as the <UNK> friend his character is likable other than randy and al this show sucks
<START> the plot of this <UNK> down to ah versus satan and what i remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions <UNK> blood noise and let's not forget that <UNK> satanic <UNK> the story is nonsensical utterly predictable and so full of holes i couldn't take a bit of it seriously stick to rosemary's baby or the exorcist if you want to see a really good devil movie and um well i can't think of any good action movies at the moment probably because they're so far and few between so you're on your own in that category this flick does get a 3 out of 10 rating from me for its camp value and for a pretty good performance by gabriel <UNK> as that old satan
<START> what an original piece of work i've always enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> the actor but now one must appreciate the man on a multi dimensional level how did he get that field of was it it sure looked real and how do you audition a dog knowing you are going to get that kind of performance does the academy have a category for animals i guess what i'm saying is that i really really enjoyed this quirky offbeat little indie film from the excellent cast one would never know eugene was not a pro actor to the cinematographer some beautiful shots the music bought the cd when <UNK> the theater and of course the two <UNK> direction and the dog all in all a 10 br br
<START> there are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is what i wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small the manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for <UNK> if there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both the first <UNK> nuclear <UNK> was fired up under the stands of the university of chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding <UNK> as a <UNK> it's a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to <UNK> to a small group of <UNK> in new mexico br br the other thing i really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after germany <UNK> okay we have thousands of mostly men who worked for years to make a really big boom does anyone think they didn't want to see it work there was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device but it was not that serious clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be
<START> if there were two parts that the physically <UNK> ugly charismatic actor <UNK> depardieu was born as a frenchman to play it must surely have been <UNK> de <UNK> and the <UNK> georges here he <UNK> the film both through the <UNK> of his shoulders and the power of his voice his charisma carries the part despite the fact that it is made clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as any of the rest of them <UNK> while the people of paris <UNK> but he is the one man who can challenge the <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> of public safety in the name of <UNK> and he is presented as the hero of the film despite the fact that the source play practically his <UNK> <UNK> br br for those who know the characters from history there is interest to be had in <UNK> the minor parts the frog faced the <UNK> the <UNK> the dashing <UNK> st just the epic painter david but the script cuts little slack in this respect names are often late in coming if minor characters are identified at all and there is no hollywood style <UNK> to make sure that the audience can place events in their historical context the film takes it for granted that you know what has gone before and what will happen after sometimes it takes too much for granted as when it relies on a close knowledge of dates to provide the <UNK> to its tail in the fact that <UNK> followed shortly to the <UNK> br br considered as a film it's not entirely satisfactory in that it <UNK> away towards the end the structure of the story leads up to some great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or some dramatic climax to the trial which thanks to history never actually happens things just <UNK> out there is no revolt there is no <UNK> of <UNK> there is no <UNK> of power by the victor there is no triumph on either side it may be historically accurate but it's not entirely satisfying as the outcome of a screen scenario it seems an odd place to stop as others have commented it might have been more logical to take events up to the end of the terror and show in the fall of <UNK>
<START> excellent hitchcock thriller with robert <UNK> proving once again that he could really act up a storm br br this time he is a defense plant worker caught up in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant br br <UNK> lane is the girl who suddenly becomes interested in <UNK> as the plot <UNK> and he is pursued from california to n y br br there is a diabolical plot by a group of wealthy <UNK> <UNK> to destroy from from within hitchcock was known to play up the upper <UNK> of society involved in mayhem in his long career as a director br br ironically the film <UNK> at the very end while we see what happens to the guy who killed friend we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang again many of whom represent the upper <UNK> of society
<START> i seen this movie when it came out i thought what an average movie i have now realized that this director was ahead of his time this is a great movie and great soundtrack i have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap which i did not like this film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but this is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a rock star yeah i said it everyone wants to grow up and be on the spot light weather said or not this movie just puts you in the core of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of <UNK> i must admit the acting was less par but still the music and story was enough to hold you in to it till the credits rolled worth the watch especially if you are a fan of <UNK> <UNK> mighty hair bands
<START> really really what <UNK> audience american one in this so called show is totally beyond me what can we learn from these series br br 1 each casino there is spending about 2 3 billion bucks every year to rent a satellite and enormous <UNK> of hi tech high resolution cameras for their security team let fbi bites the dust of them br br 2 every security employee must have <UNK> breasts of course natural ones the tits must be shown all the time otherwise they will lose their job br br 3 if the employee happens to be a male he needs to get breasts <UNK> then go to step 2 br br 4 only in hollywood one can blatantly rip off other show's ideas then <UNK> them as their own and call all this crap original and art br br 5 every security with tits bigger than is considered immortal and cannot die br br i really would like to have the opportunity to vote with minus values 10 10 for this one
<START> this movie was unfortunately terrible br br clichéd hackneyed stilted dialogue and acting make it almost unwatchable br br the feel good finale is laughably lame br br there is a reason judge career has <UNK> br br if you don't live in new york and aren't jewish several of the jokes will be <UNK> br br i too found the need to have the <UNK> lesbian daughter go straight at the end quite insulting br br i simply cannot <UNK> how this film was so popular at film <UNK> br br it is without a doubt one of the worst films i have seen in quite some time
<START> nine out of nine people who watched this have <UNK> themselves to be mentally <UNK> for life no one should ever have to see this abomination the english language is poorly <UNK> to express how utterly dreadfully atrocious this film is it's really not worth the plastic it's made of no greater crime has been committed by the human race in the entire history of creation never is there likely to be anything worse br br it was agreed <UNK> that the scene involving the <UNK> head of tommy and the young girl's <UNK> was unbelievably sick and twisted in fact many of us have not yet <UNK> from the ordeal and are currently sitting in the corner of the room <UNK> sucking our thumbs and <UNK> br br the fundamental question on everyone's lips however has to be why how is it possible for anyone to create such a monstrosity and then subject it to so many innocent people after viewing the trailer we thought that this film might be a laugh how wrong we were br br please sign the <UNK> to rid the world of <UNK> heads so that no other poor civilians be exposed to it please for the good of humanity
<START> the mission to see the movie the cave was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave some young cave <UNK> and not much else it's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did br br the immediate <UNK> of a movie like this is the creature what's he going to look like why does he live in a cave how is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like alien and predator and the <UNK> the cave demons do not look far from the <UNK> creature in alien <UNK> and even has the sight of predator shame that's a total ripoff br br well let's look at the plot very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave <UNK> is sent to find a cave and its <UNK> in the <UNK> mountains the casting was very much clear that we want young hip tough chicks <UNK> guys and the girls who have brains also have to be hot we also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the film makers are biased to a certain viewpoint totally been done and i'm totally tired of it br br the other main problem was the ending as if to say there might be a sequel shoot me if there is one the <UNK> on ending made me <UNK> br br i gave this movie 3 10 stars the points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creature <UNK> for their high quality job spent on the <UNK> and design for the monsters who <UNK> within even when they looked totally ripped off and there's an interesting yet <UNK> documentary on the dvd on underwater cave diving go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before and it was better the first time
<START> contains spoilers br br garfield and his owner jon <UNK> were in a <UNK> they basically had no life at all all they did was lay around and count the ceiling jon even organized his <UNK> <UNK> according to color and fabric he needed a life so he <UNK> a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman a bar was a great place to start unfortunately when the music started and jon hit the dance floor we see what made disco die jon killed it jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store he ended up feeling down in the mouth literally the <UNK> was no prize either when jon and his would be date get a glimpse of each other's underwear jon tried to act all buff at the beach but soon he <UNK> a real buff guy which left jon feeling once again down in the mouth literally jon then tried to pick up girls walking and <UNK> by no <UNK> jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat a fat man walked up and <UNK> <UNK> guitar it was hopeless br br fortunately for jon an ad <UNK> on the tv an ad for <UNK> school for the personality <UNK> it guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps jon and garfield attend the class the building didn't exactly look the same way it did on tv nor did <UNK> act as <UNK> as he did on tv jon sat next to a pretty girl named <UNK> so while <UNK> taught his lessons of introducing yourself checking your pulse and pretending to speak a foreign language jon and <UNK> get to know one another they leave together forgetting all about garfield at home jon and <UNK> just sat on the <UNK> and talked garfield was jealous of <UNK> for fear that she would take jon away from him garfield <UNK> the future jon and <UNK> get married she moves in and soon she gives birth to a little <UNK> who is <UNK> at pulling <UNK> tale back to the present garfield would not stand for it he tried to get jon to get rid of <UNK> until she started scratching behind his ears but then jon learned that <UNK> was <UNK> to cats so that was basically the end of their relationship but they still saw each other every now and then and garfield was sure to be with them br br another hilarious garfield tv special this one was made during the run of tv's garfield and friends garfield was <UNK> down somewhat somewhat since early 1980's cartoons the scenes of jon trying to pick up chicks is funny so is the one where the fat guy <UNK> on <UNK> guitar good ol' <UNK> music is back as garfield <UNK> huge is jon frank <UNK> the third man of 1 000 voices is <UNK> and june <UNK> the woman of 1 000 voices is <UNK> if you like garfield then i recommend you see garfield gets a life today it along with here comes garfield and garfield on the town were just released on dvd so check them all out today you are guaranteed a good time hey has garfield ever let you down before br br
<START> this movie absolutely terrible not only was the acting awful but so was the sleep got while this movie played this movie achieved the all powerful goal of crap i watched this movie thinking my 5 wouldn't b in vein but i was very wrong i guarantee u r better off just reading what i have to say about this unbelievably horrible movie <UNK> yourself in the way of this dignity <UNK> movie i give it a negative 1 for trying but no please no don't watch this movie i had friends who joined me for this film shortly after they were no longer found this movie actually will make u end your life please please don't see it i beg of u if u see this movie make sure u destroy all copies because this movie is a <UNK> of satan
<START> i know this movie is a low budget horror movie intended for those in favor of shocks and <UNK> gore but even considering that this movie is just too dull filled with an incoherent plot along with awful music and obvious signs that this movie was never finished br br without giving any spoilers i'll just say that by the final reel things are wrapped up with no at all either by film or narration the girl is real attractive but yet that is not a good enough reason to enjoy this movie br br if you are a fan of those gore movies from the 60's and 70's then you should watch it but be warned that it does not even reach to the usual <UNK> of these kinds of movies
<START> ok so this film is well acted it has good direction but the simple fact is that it <UNK> what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years the straight man deciding to be gay and the gay man deciding to be straight i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes after that i got really offended as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles the leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling <UNK> all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our <UNK>
<START> i think this movie is amazing but there is one problem there is one song that i want to find but cannot find it it starts on about 18 minutes just after the coach has said what are u the <UNK> of the family and then looks at the fat kid takes his hat off then he says go the song that starts there i would like to know what it is does any 1 no email me please or add a comment it starts something along those lines i just think it is an amazing dance track i would love to have that song so that i could use it in my break dancing lessons it starts when they are jumping and running over the orange fast <UNK> things which are used in football training to help you run faster
<START> i was amazed about this early performance of clint eastwood i had not read a summary of the film when i decided to watch it on tv due to mr eastwood i expected some nice shootings and no deep story i was quite mistaken i found a couple of topics unusually <UNK> addressed and until the end i couldn't make up my mind about who's good and who's bad this movie is definitely not typical eastwood but surely worth watching
<START> this is exactly what australian television and australian politics needs people with a sense of humour good on abc for supporting these guys the show is based around a couple of aussie <UNK> who know how to take the mickey out of politicians or other people in the <UNK> the boys use sydney as their main base for making a <UNK> in the public keep an eye out for the crazy guy or mr ten questions the guys who perform these acts are the same guys that presented if you enjoyed and the then you will love this show i am still interested in knowing which stunts are real and which are purely acting because there are some questionable actions made by the guys
<START> i can not say this movie was a hilarious but i must have had a grin on my face the entire time i like this darker kind of comedy very bad things 8 heads in a <UNK> bag or <UNK> br br the way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch to me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be but the way that ending came about was another thing that sticks out is the way they have managed to involve the audience the way terry looks at us is hilarious you can almost pretend you're his <UNK>
<START> after reading over all these reviews i'm very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 nbc cop show m squad starring lee marvin i read reviews comparing it to <UNK> and some of the quinn martin police shows but if you watch m squad you'll see it was based on it in the late 1958 episodes of m squad <UNK> you'll see lee marvin who plays lieutenant detective frank get out of his car and then hes shot at and he shoots back the beginning of police squad is basically the same including the jazz music and then lee marvin <UNK> what goes on im lieutenant detective frank m squad a special department of the chicago police and in police squad leslie <UNK> does the same im detective lieutenant frank police squad a special division of the police department and so on in one of the m squad episodes there's even the johnny the guy character and in a m squad episode entitled more deadly there's a police squad episode entitled a substantial gift the broken promise which is the same story
<START> with my two stars i will probably make it to the head of the imdb it list for this apparently tremendously popular tv series br br not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this website i decided to purchase a dvd edition of the series because i usually find british humour suits me just fine i gave up in the middle of the second <UNK>  and according to other comments the bits were already through br br so now i know according to another comment that i definitely lack a sense of humour but then i had to laugh like crazy while watching and re watching <UNK> towers to which black books is  albeit <UNK>  <UNK> related why the different reactions it might be a mere generation thing and yet the differences can be pointed out br br both <UNK> towers and black books are set in <UNK> which are meant to sustain their owners <UNK> both <UNK> are not successful but seem  by a miracle  to survive <UNK> towers is funny because the protagonists have to deal with situations they cannot cope with the lies in the fact that they make a serious effort to succeed and while laughing one also feels sorry for them black books has no situations it's just there and the owner passes his time feeling sorry for himself if a situation threatens to <UNK> it is quickly away it is remarkable how fast and how often a subject is dropped and the protagonists turn to something entirely different to produce an additional joke telling jokes  and not very good ones seems to be all black books is about why a <UNK> a <UNK> store would have done the job just as well br br no stop wait it's a <UNK> because below the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and arrogance the protagonists are supposed to be delicate and <UNK> they are not some <UNK> <UNK> but bumbling semi intellectual losers hey they are like you and me the manner in which the series makes that claim is the only way i can explain its success there is nothing remarkable in the <UNK> actions what's special about them is their <UNK> unrealistic living conditions many viewers maybe envy them for that protagonists that <UNK> and vapid convey a sense of <UNK> and <UNK> seems to be a trademark of the time the first world is <UNK> living in br br recently i watched also a fairly new british tv comedy show i found it <UNK> funny it is often quite tasteless or <UNK>  but always with a purpose and hitting the <UNK> eye in its social criticism the humour is mainly created by situations or by characters with a purpose the low ratings in imdb might indicate that this brand of humour is not in keeping with the times but i am glad it's still alive and kicking and hope it will continue to do so
<START> i can't add much to what has been said already except i'm going to have to because of the 10 lines minimum policy br br i've actually got this on a vhs to dvd copy but the quality is quite poor and i desperately need for it to be officially released br br i can just imagine what extras i would like to see tim <UNK> character swearing his way through one of those type <UNK> would be great you can imagine it now can't you but of course it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a dvd release br br surely to god there must be someone in the dvd releases department at <UNK> who also knows something about british culture is web <UNK> and has enough about them to look at imdb now and again oh well
<START> i checked this out at the <UNK> international film festival and was not impressed br br the only area of the film i enjoyed was the commentary on film making for the most part this film seemed random and somewhat <UNK> i don't say that in a <UNK> way however and just silly it was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life which may sounds intriguing in some films but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perverse br br my criticism of this film is not upon the actors rather the story itself i found it boring and <UNK> i wanted my money back but considering it was a film festival that wasn't about to happen
<START> i saw this movie <UNK> before something else i rented a while back and it looked decent i've seen some good stuff from full moon video and thought it was worth a shot unfortunately this was not good stuff br br the story is about a possessed bed a couple moves into a new apartment discovers the bed and odd things start happening odd things like the woman discovers kinky sex and the man discovers kinky sex and the woman draws pictures of kinky sex and the man photographs kinky sex and they both start having dreams about dead people having kinky sex you'd think a movie with so much kinky sex would be good right br br well no the problem is that this is supposed to be a scary movie or at least a thriller and it just doesn't deliver there is little tension no suspense and no fear aside from some <UNK> dreams and visions there really isn't anything for this couple to be worried about the whole movie is basically the two of them having these visions and playing around in bed sure you get a monster fight at the end and some bloodshed but nothing spectacular there's only one murder and one good scare and that's it br br and the kinky sex don't get your hopes up or anything else for that matter their idea of kinky sex is woman on top fully <UNK> trying to <UNK> her mate with a <UNK> not exactly my idea of a good time
<START> pretentious <UNK> <UNK> herman <UNK> about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his <UNK> mother getting transferred to his long lost sister who has been raised by <UNK> or something like that  not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi layered plot <UNK> out with pornographic sex scenes pseudo symbolic imagery the siblings swimming in a river of blood and other bizarre touches a gypsy child repeatedly insults <UNK> by in the street until she is <UNK> beaten to death the <UNK> music of a rock group <UNK> in the <UNK> of old buildings considering the source material and the presence of catherine <UNK> who at least gets to <UNK> in the nude i was expecting a lot more from this one apparently there's an even longer tv version of x out <UNK>
<START> i have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed and in my opinion this movie lacks heart i frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie br br there was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so <UNK> up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life or trying so hard not to that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it i have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough but i felt this film lack of the <UNK> and heart of the other and i was left wondering what the point was or if the point of the movie was that it had no point honestly while i didn't feel like <UNK> my hair out during the movie i did <UNK> the lost time on the sad little film br br i have no doubt that some people will love this movie but frankly i didn't
<START> i went into this movie expecting a piece about how to be accepted in culture and i wound up blowing 8 50 on a 10 minute fart joke and a whole bunch of fake accents sorry jeff but if you're going for the whole cult thing you gotta a while to go
<START> the <UNK> and the snowman is the story of two young men a cia employee and a drug dealer who become <UNK> with united states foreign policy and sell state secrets to the soviet union the events of the film are based on a true story br br timothy <UNK> and sean penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations the supporting cast also performs well notably with a performance from david <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> fame as a seasoned soviet agent br br the film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in however it does seem overlong and <UNK> at points in the middle the ending however is tense stunning and effective there are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack but also unfortunately a repeated <UNK> <UNK> track that doesn't fit with a spy story there are other spy films more worth seeking out than the <UNK> and the snowman but it is a decent film none the less
<START> just watched this on dvd three times once the <UNK> way once with the scenes in <UNK> order in this <UNK> of a film noir the beginning middle and end of the story <UNK> and once with the director's commentary running quite amazing a bare bones tale told with more flair energy and substance than most big budget overblown features being released today br br i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent <UNK> which turned me on to nolan in the first place can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget and bigger box office stars in his next film insomnia
<START> this movie was not very well directed they almost totally <UNK> the book i guess they were trying 2 save time the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played was cute some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book major parts of the book were once again chopped out you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary also i was surprised not pleasantly by a new character that was no where in the book one of my favorite characters <UNK> was poorly interpreted and portrayed he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real <UNK> was in the book over all disappointing
<START> i viewed the movie for a second time on september 30 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time i saw it i thoroughly enjoyed the acting especially uncle benny i thought that fred carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film the story line definitely kept your interest and i hope this movie makes it all the way to the top i felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end well lets just say i didn't see it coming i also thought that craig the actor who played eddie monroe did an excellent job and i hope that this movie will help him to go further in his acting career from start to finish i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> i rented this film because it was a documentary and highly rated it's more a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his <UNK> father was than anything about architecture br br more than anything else the underlying theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric highly praised possibly genius architect who had little regard for anything or anyone outside is profession br br the tragedy of the film is the broken families he left his baby mothers came across more as <UNK> fans than irresponsible women which can only have negative results on the children br br that said <UNK> the producer of the film and son of louis khan came across as fairly stable and curious if not bitter the people he interviewed were of course more interested in talking about louis <UNK> buildings than his personal problems but i find the mix of themes made the film interesting br br as for his buildings i found them like abstract art strange non practical and usually only appreciated by so called critics
<START> just to <UNK> matthew wasn't a real person but a character combination of 2 killers who were both convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers br br i read the user comments and they react as if matthew was real the character is based on a mixture of two killers <UNK> patrick and robert lee willie who murdered separate people and the murder itself was based on the one willie committed the conflict of both willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well br br approach is unique in that she not only is <UNK> to the <UNK> as they wait for their death and <UNK> them in taking responsibility for their actions she also reaches out to the <UNK> families to help them know that the convict did indeed feel <UNK> for what they did effectively <UNK> both parties br br everyone <UNK> here seems to have strong beliefs on the death sentence it's not my place to say it's right or wrong in theory <UNK> death with death makes some sort of <UNK> sense however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days although <UNK> makes more sense to me being stuck in a small room 23 7 with one hour of exercise for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishment they are technically alive but denied living say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required like susan smith killing her poor kids by <UNK> her car into a lake i find it <UNK> ironic that they would not get that freedom they <UNK> and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned br br point comes through the story very well she has my respect she manages to find that balance she isn't supporting a killer she is <UNK> them to accepting what they did if they didn't feel some kind of <UNK> they wouldn't be asking for spiritual <UNK> br br <UNK> final note when <UNK> to parent for killing his son the parents of the girl who was also murdered <UNK> something about why he didn't apologize for her death i think the point was that throughout the movie <UNK> killing both kids there is doubt in mind he did both killings there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death my thought is that killed the boy and the other man murdered the girl hence was taking responsibility for what he did had he been responsible for the girl's death he probably would have <UNK> for that as well
<START> i think that the movie was really good subject acting and ali <UNK> music were marvellous although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male dominated culture he has neglected character a bit and has <UNK> more on the violence faced by her
<START> i've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i first caught the trailer and i'm so glad now that i have it's truly a wonderful film the actors are superb the writing is fresh and real the whole thing was just spot on i love james <UNK> in this and i can't wait to see him in the lion the witch and the wardrobe movie this december <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful too be sure to check her out in i capture the castle or nicholas <UNK> two of my favorite films overall i think i liked this movie because it didn't chicken out it's a difficult subject matter to tell a story about in that you're very likely to offend a lot of people or mess up and make it into some overly sentimental <UNK> sweet love fest but they avoided doing that completely and instead made a film that's real honest and touching yes but never over the top very well done amazingly well done go out and see it and you'll know exactly what i mean
<START> the first <UNK> wasn't that great but i really didn't expect it to be but this horrible movie was just beyond criticism i really try to look on the bright side and give movies like this a chance but i just could not find a real good thing about this one i appreciate what bill was trying to do but this movie was just <UNK> boring the story of the movie really isn't that bad in fact it's somewhat original but the movie form is really as bad as a lot of people say in my opinion this one ranks right up there with the off season and dracula 3000 i know a lot of people really trash and put down movies like this but i really can't think of any other good things to say about it
<START> i guess by the time i saw this episode i had seen enough twilight <UNK> to have it figured out ahead of time there is this odd <UNK> of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a <UNK> they are fine until an <UNK> soldier shows up in their midst it is his prime <UNK> to escape and so he <UNK> the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the <UNK> there is much discussion about purpose and reason and <UNK> on their <UNK> but no one can remember anything they represent different jobs a <UNK> a <UNK> a clown a man in a <UNK> hat why are they there it leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end but i guess i had a pretty good idea before it all happened
<START> i saw the second part of this beautiful period piece set on a ship sometime in the 19th century book must be responsible for some of the superb dialogue but everything else was good too i especially liked the way they created the period and feeling of being on the ship so well for me this had a feeling of <UNK> about it which i know i won't be able to convey in words perhaps it was the way they mixed in technical and historical details about <UNK> in the <UNK> hundreds to the story without messing it up <UNK> was excellent as was the rest of the cast it's not often a mini series sends me to the zone but this one did
<START> if you love chan <UNK> park you know what to expect his films are brutal poetic tragic and artistic with <UNK> of very grim humor <UNK> is clearly <UNK> style and i loved every second of it from the cinematography every shot is gorgeous and creative to the story which <UNK> shakespearean tragedy murderous love gothic horror and layered character drama the characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around even the most <UNK> character evokes sympathy the direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced like sympathy for mr vengeance there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing chan <UNK> park is an intelligent bold consistently surprising filmmaker it's unpredictable scenes go from brutal and heart wrenching to laugh out loud hilarious in an instant this is closer to lady vengeance then sympathy for mr vengeance as far as being over the top and comical but like lady vengeance it's incredibly rich thought provoking and rewarding br br if you like beautifully told vampire stories let the right one in or are a fan of chan <UNK> park seeing <UNK> should be obvious easily one of the best films of 2009
<START> i watched this movie only because i was under the impression that i was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick i mean look at the tag line they're men turned inside out and worse they're still alive does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you and the then there's the title itself what a perfectly apt title for a horror movie i thought unfortunately i wasn't aware that the real title was properly translated the island of the br br so about an hour into watching this i realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all it was a cheesy adventure story about slimy fish men from atlantis men turned inside out no there was nothing of the sort i was grossly disappointed br br damn you misleading <UNK> i want those <UNK> minutes of my life back
<START> the what now yeah i thought it was a stupid name as well chris carter remains <UNK> unaware of the <UNK> in his writing staff starting off with the usual <UNK> x files <UNK> a baby getting run over by a train this episode well i can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going <UNK> br br poorly written with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters except maybe that baby at the start the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off it's the worst technique ever are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters of hate them don't ask me br br not only is it boring and un scary but it's like watching a really bad omen sequel with overblown and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects although to be brutally honest that's the least of my <UNK> br br sara b began her x files career with a <UNK> and thankfully ended it with one as well br br verdict br br in the words of my <UNK> teacher mr horrible awful
<START> this show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch the stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good there are lots of children in my family boys and girls and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the <UNK> knights it is a wonderful show and i hope that they will continue to keep making it all of the kids in my family and myself think that vincent walsh is the best of them all we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job we wish all of the actors actresses writers directors and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work
<START> i actually liked this movie sure the acting was flat there was no plot and the villain was the <UNK> that i've seen michael as <UNK> is worth laughs in his own right with an incredibly funny <UNK> and evil laugh but its worth seeing just for the worst explosion you will ever see outside of the power rangers tv series you'll know it when you see it honestly this movie must have the budget of a low grade porno i almost stopped watching after an hour but i recommend watching through the whole thing at the very least there's plenty of eye candy for all to enjoy recommended for viewers with a high tolerance to poor movies
<START> well now this strange movie it was listed as a comedy but i certainly found nothing to laugh at actually i am struggling to find anything positive to say about this film oh here i go alex is not bad in the lead role and i did not pick the ending for a change but apart from that this has no great direction <UNK> two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama i would really avoid ever having to watch this movie again and think it does nothing to benefit any of the working class characters it is attempting to portray i found it hard to <UNK> for any of the characters and was not given enough information on the lead character jimmy to believe his motives best avoided
<START> it's the best movie i've watched this year excellent detail and storyline for a remake br br it presents to you a what if situation <UNK> the island of japan could totally be wiped out of this earth a thought provoking life and death situation and not to mention all life on earth well in this particular japan it also presents a great and genius solution to this massive tragedy br br horror action suspense sci fi documentary love story and all the human interest story you can get you'll find everything here but i also warn you that it is a real <UNK> the casts actors and all are all excellent better than any hollywood movie br br the thing is this could really happen to anywhere on earth now let me ask you this after you've seen it what would you do if you are faced in this life and death situation
<START> ok i've now seen george <UNK> in at least four separate horror suspense films recently as i worked my way through various 50 pack <UNK> and i have to say the guy had a limited range but he was good at what he did he wasn't karloff but <UNK> was lucky to have him br br but the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back water ghetto of horror films and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest not with the thread bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under that's the case here br br this movie is well slow <UNK> and <UNK> for the most part the heroine seems to be doomed to be a rent a center version of judy garland the hero is bland as white rice and the poor guy playing the monster doesn't even get a good transformation scene out of the deal his make up effects aren't scary at all he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand is all br br it's not a total waste <UNK> looks good on camera he <UNK> the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without <UNK> or losing the flow there are some moody b w shots here and there that don't completely suck br br so all in all this movie helped some c through z level actors pay their rent for another month and it never sinks below a certain <UNK> out level of quality watch it once if you like george <UNK> or just feel the need to see every <UNK> themed movie ever made
<START> was this supposed to be funny this is one of those films that just doesn't work the first one bruce almighty with jim carey had some very funny moments this one had none br br steve <UNK> who was brilliant in bruce almighty fails to deliver here his performance is very ordinary and he can't carry it off like carey did br br the one good thing about this is i only paid 1 95 to rent it it's a movie for children very young children who have only seen about 4 films or so in their short lives br br it's interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that it's usually a huge turkey anyone remember son of mask imdb worst 100 films of all time avoid this one movie lovers
<START> the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high when he accepted to direct this movie i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being <UNK> to watch that stupid movie my parents make me watch it as punishment don't watch it the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high when he accepted to direct this movie i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being <UNK> to watch that stupid movie my parents make me watch it as punishment don't watch it the director of this movie must have been mentally ill or even high when he accepted to direct this movie i'd rather stare at my ceiling for 5 hours straight instead of being <UNK> to watch that stupid movie my parents make me watch it as punishment don't watch it
<START> i have wanted to say this since i first saw the movie i still will not allow any of my children or <UNK> to watch this at least not until i tell them and they understand that it is completely fiction the only thing that i saw that was correct was that animals went onto the <UNK> everything else was false lot and <UNK> fighting on the ocean like a pirate movie make sure you tell your kids the real story before you allow them to watch it but really until they are old enough to understand that it is not real they may have a messed up vision of the bible this was the worst bible movie i have ever seen bruce and <UNK> almighty were much better and had more to teach let your children watch those
<START> there are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the <UNK> copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing some versions also <UNK> most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there the cut i saw has the on screen title witchcraft evil encounters and was released by <UNK> show who maintain the original us release title <UNK> for the dvd release it's a nice looking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some <UNK> aspect ratio issues in italy it was released as la <UNK> 4 witchcraft the first two la <UNK> releases were actually the first two evil dead films <UNK> and the third la <UNK> was another film by the same production company <UNK> which is best known here in america as <UNK> to make matters even more confusing <UNK> was also released elsewhere as <UNK> 2 except in germany where <UNK> 2 is actually the ogre demons 3 ok i better just shut up now i'm starting to confuse myself br br regardless of the title this is a very hit or miss horror effort some of it is good some of it isn't i actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess a large <UNK> hotel located on an island about 50 miles from boston is the setting as various people get picked off one by one by a german speaking witch <UNK> <UNK> photographer gary david <UNK> who wants to capture witch light and his <UNK> writer girlfriend leslie <UNK> who is studying witchcraft are <UNK> up at the hotel without <UNK> along comes real estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who's showing off the property to potential <UNK> rose annie ross and <UNK> robert <UNK> brooks also <UNK> along are their children pregnant grown daughter jane linda blair and very young son tommy michael <UNK> as well as <UNK> architect linda sullivan catherine <UNK> <UNK> wife at the time once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the lady in black br br so what can you expect to find here plenty of <UNK> one of the characters has their lips <UNK> shut and is then hung upside down in the <UNK> and accidentally slow <UNK> by the rest of the cast there's also a <UNK> witches eating a dead baby a <UNK> through the head someone set on fire a possession a <UNK> street tape <UNK> the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys <UNK> <UNK> and exploding thanks to voodoo doll <UNK> and some other stuff from a technical standpoint it's a nice looking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects the hotel island setting is also pretty nice blair particularly at the end and ross both seem like they're having fun and <UNK> is great as the evil witch even though people like to <UNK> <UNK> these days he's not bad in his role either br br on the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too when characters are being swept into the witches <UNK> to be tortured and killed the filmmakers <UNK> decided to <UNK> the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral <UNK> effect that looks <UNK> cheesy and the witch <UNK> itself is <UNK> and cheaply designed with unfinished <UNK> and while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays <UNK> girlfriend and the kid are so bad they're constantly distracting
<START> role <UNK> remake of the major and the minor has jerry lewis stepping into the part originally played by ginger rogers but unfortunately this <UNK> outing is missing a lot more than just ginger lewis attempts to pass for a child when <UNK> a train he's successful but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic <UNK> sidney <UNK> adapted the screenplay <UNK> in musical moments for dean martin playing yet another in his stable of second <UNK> and a jewel robbery subplot which is dire diana <UNK> who played the <UNK> teenager in the original film plays <UNK> love interest here she's cute jerry isn't 1 2 from
<START> this was one of the most emotional movies i have seen passion pleasure pain despair sorrow healing <UNK> and love br br the entire movie was <UNK> everything was done so well the adaptation from the book the actors the sets the camera shots br br this movie touched me deeply in so many ways it reminded me of the despair that <UNK> your love can have and the time it takes to <UNK> that wound you may love again but will always be <UNK> the pain that comes with <UNK> br br is this not one of the most important age old questions br br is it better to have love and lost br br than to never have loved before br br <UNK>
<START> they just don't make cartoons like they used to this one had wit great characters and the greatest ensemble of voice over artists ever assembled for a daytime cartoon show this still remains as one of the highest rated daytime cartoon shows and one of the most <UNK> winning several emmy awards
<START> i must <UNK> this comment with a sort of admission i suppose i just have a soft spot for the original 60s 70s tv series i think the filmmakers here blew it from the get go as far as casting in a supposed remake audiences would look for <UNK> of the hip athletic clarence williams iii or the cool with it michael cole and so forth instead we get <UNK> <UNK> as a poor little white rich boy who comes off as just pathetic like he is in all his roles in the office i used to work in i amused myself once by creating a fake movie poster casting various actors as members of the office staff guess who i cast as the <UNK> son of the company president danes does ok as the new julie but none of the characters have much to do as the story just sort of sits there <UNK> in <UNK> so it's quite forgettable besides what was i talking about
<START> an interesting movie with <UNK> <UNK> as a young woman who travels to europe in an attempt to find out what became of her older sister cameron diaz who mysteriously died years earlier <UNK> is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic plotting such as having her find and start a romance with her dead sister's much older boyfriend christopher <UNK> still mostly good grade b
<START> the movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest the movie had nothing <UNK> funny dramatic or romantic about it how can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets a the right guy until the last seen in the movie than the movie ends maybe part ii will be romantic but somebody else will have to risk wasting their money i have nothing else to say other than do not waste your time the movie had nothing <UNK> funny dramatic or romantic about it the movie had nothing <UNK> funny dramatic or romantic about it the movie had nothing <UNK> funny dramatic or romantic about it the movie had nothing <UNK> funny dramatic or romantic about it
<START> le <UNK> is a very good film though it does suffer a bit since there have already been similar films in all too many ways the movie is reminiscent of previous heist films such as <UNK> and grand slam and many others so while director <UNK> and the actors did great jobs it all seems like a case of <UNK> <UNK> because of this i had a hard time giving this excellent film a higher score br br the one unusual aspect of the film is how the crooks get together instead of the usual means <UNK> escapes from prison and just happens to meet up with corey a career criminal just released from prison both are a good match but having them both work in parallel for much of the film until they meet was a clever touch apart from that as expected much of the movie concerns the <UNK> details in planning and <UNK> the crime i also appreciated how the film showed the crooks in such a cold and detached manner something relatively common in french crime films but rare among american films until recent years br br overall extremely well crafted and worth seeing if you don't mind that it seems a tad repetitive you'll see some fine acting direction and a lot of great tension
<START> a unique blend of musical film noir and comedy with a few sex scenes thrown in for good measure the only other film i can think of with a fairly similarly wild and <UNK> mixture of themes and clichés is the french movie billy <UNK> kick but that has a more surreal and quirky approach br br not that this film would not be surreal or quirky the humour is at times quite subtle at other times blatantly in your face and often crossing the border to <UNK> to give an example in the post <UNK> <UNK> chat with a prostitute our hero max encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder using the words los literally this phrase means shoot in german and that is exactly what a hidden assassin does in response in other words this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun br br is also one of the very rare examples of films with funny sex scenes <UNK> romance is accompanied by the song <UNK> will i want more while the song perfectly <UNK> the action the meaning of its words changes a couple of times <UNK> at the end at <UNK> inability of providing any further service the film's main love scene between max and <UNK> <UNK> lacks such subtlety this is jaw dropping stuff especially when singing slowly into <UNK> of course all in the rhythm of the music br br <UNK> unless you are one of the easily offended
<START> this film is one of my childhood memories seeing the muppets at the height of their popularity heading hollywood singing and dancing with miss <UNK> her beloved <UNK> <UNK> bear doing his best as everyone's manager and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be <UNK> br br <UNK> melancholy <UNK> number <UNK> connection was nominated for an oscar that year but was beat out by norma it goes like it goes i'll pick <UNK> song any day get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy someday they'll find it the <UNK> connections the lovers the <UNK> and me
<START> wow i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert <UNK> and <UNK> lee miller in ' this is a phenomenal movie it has action romance suspense intrigue and wit when i wasn't laughing i was at the edge of my seat this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century this film has everything to keep me happy
<START> just reading the reviews of this wonderful bbc mini series reminded me how much i enjoyed this when it was first broadcast many years ago at the time i remember waiting with anticipation for the next installment and fell in love with john <UNK> and janet <UNK> two talented actors that we don't see enough of on tv or cinema these days br br i have tried without success to obtain several of the fantastic dramas from the past including the 1973 version of jane eyre and the 1972 version of anne of green <UNK> all wonderful timeless classic stories which sadly the bbc seem to have no intention of releasing on video or dvd if anyone learns otherwise i would love to hear from them br br in the meantime we will have to content ourselves with our <UNK> of how wonderful they were
<START> that's a bad raunchy predictable tacky <UNK> soap opera the best of everything is just such a guilty pleasure for me something along the lines of valley of the dolls i mean best has everything somebody gets pregnant out of <UNK> <UNK> the last time you heard that phrase there are affairs everywhere drinking <UNK> jealousy and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death br br caroline <UNK> hope lange and mike rice the delicious stephen <UNK> are the of the goings on their chemistry is immediate and is the <UNK> that keeps this film from becoming too <UNK> br br <UNK> parker the off the <UNK> gorgeous ex fashion model appears as <UNK> adams an aspiring stage actress a role that according to any biography i've ever read about her was apparently not much of a stretch but parker does a surprisingly credible job here more than holding her own in a couple of scenes opposite louis who plays david savage probably took this role for the money and the special screen credit because he was clearly headed down the aging star has been road br br diane baker is fine as naive <UNK> april <UNK> martha <UNK> as barbara has a particularly <UNK> storyline and film legend joan crawford <UNK> her usual serving of scenery as amanda <UNK> another role like savage that crawford likely took for the paycheck br br there is some obviously dated dialog and plot devices this is 1959 and the predictability of the soap opera genre but if you like a good soap as i do the best of everything will more than satisfy you
<START> it would be so easy to dismiss an alien <UNK> movie before even seeing it as i did but this is well worth a look if you think about it its not an easy subject matter to handle but this film manages to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject casting the main character as a doctor was a sensible move which lends <UNK> to his <UNK> to believe in the possibility of alien <UNK> <UNK> plays it very <UNK> involving us in his pain and confusion at the weird events that <UNK> himself and his wife special effects are used <UNK> but to shocking effect and at times the movie is totally gripping but sadly there are a couple of points where the plot wanders and leaves some confusion also after building to a tense climax the ending is something of a let down the supporting characters were unnecessarily weak the alien hunter or menacing the psychiatrist which also served to detract br br but all in all it raised some interesting issues amongst which was a telling line how do think animals feel when we experiment on them br br the concept of lost time was also thought provoking
<START> beyond is simply marvelous from the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending you will be amazed at how well put together this film is patricia arquette amazingly portrays laura <UNK> who we meet as a shut down and quit <UNK> young doctor unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son throughout the course of the film as she is trapped in <UNK> witnesses the <UNK> and <UNK> in the capital city of <UNK> for her life and saves her tour u life she is <UNK> her will to live this may seen contrived or heavy handed it is not john <UNK> a master at spiritual and emotional conflict paints the film with broad <UNK> and often uses symbolism to capture <UNK> emotional state and physical <UNK> patricia arquette as usual gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded laura what arquette does amazingly in any role that she plays is give us a window into her character's heart without words every time she is given a close up in the film the audience is given insight into her character she does not need to speak to convey emotions or be over the top some critics were harsh on <UNK> performance in the film when it opened on august 25 1995 that she was flat or dull in the role i found her characterization dead on staying well away from the <UNK> that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place she is on shock and is reserved about her feelings that is just as normal as screaming <UNK> out at those around you i am hoping that warner brothers releases this title on dvd very soon with <UNK> hugely successful nbc drama medium bringing her to household name status not to mention an emmy win and now 2007 nomination it would be in the <UNK> best interest to do so hopefully there will be extras with the alternate ending do not by pass by this film it is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing
<START> not near as well made as the guinea pig flicks it was inspired by flowers of flesh and blood or devil's experiment and not conveying any real philosophy this video feature which is barely feature length adds hardcore sex with <UNK> <UNK> to its inspiration the special make up effects which include stomach <UNK> and <UNK> are pretty good if <UNK> the amateur feel of the production is a distraction it all looks cheap and lazy the lighting is harsh and the sound and editing are sloppy the simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie just when she gets tired of being abused the real abuse begins in the film's hero scene an actor cuts the woman's stomach open in graphic close up <UNK> his member inside it and proceeds to do his thing i didn't find psycho the snuff <UNK> shocking on the contrary i found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to one up guinea pig and its bloody <UNK> interestingly this was distributed by <UNK> a leading fetish producer
<START> this is another case of hollywood arrogance <UNK> to <UNK> french style the original <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was one of the most charming films of 1991 so naturally the <UNK> in hollywood thought they could hire depardieu and phone the rest in they did however take the of hiring francis <UNK> to write an english version albeit one <UNK> virtually every word of the original depardieu brings his <UNK> charm and <UNK> <UNK> shows all the promise that is now paying off the thing is that when the french make a sort of <UNK> <UNK> they get away with it because the <UNK> french thinking works in their favour here the hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have depardieu totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover <UNK> upon to play and song <UNK> launch into a spirited version of thank heaven for little girls see the original
<START> 4 out of 10 br br a somewhat unbelievable storyline with some haunted house type shocks that really don't fit in br br gary performance is very <UNK> not so much the quality of the performance but the <UNK> his character does not behave in a consistent manner sometimes calm relaxed <UNK> thoughtful sometimes violent loud almost crazed it's just not believable br br have many 80s movies dated badly will they be more enjoyable 20 years from now br br
<START> i saw this on cable someone had to lose their job for this one for air just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown savage instinct should be shown in all film classes it is the perfect <UNK> for how to not make a movie the editing alone is so <UNK> you'll think it was assembled by a team of trained poorly monkeys traveling across canyon road in the back of a <UNK> <UNK> and drunk the audio is often not <UNK> acting i can't call anything i saw here acting <UNK> hmmm can't call it that either failing that works all that being said it is hilarious i cannot stress enough that there is not one <UNK> factor in this film other than the hilarity derived from it's own incredible <UNK> fun in a strictly <UNK> sort of way watch it if you dare
<START> i've been writing <UNK> crime fiction for a number of years now when a writer develops a story he always has a character actor in mind to bring the story to life last weekend i found a new one in paul playing uncle benny in eddie monroe this was a slick film <UNK> by presence both on and off the screen as his voice over narration is also heard i also especially liked the actress playing <UNK> niece and <UNK> ex wife although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double crossing that goes with it a nice job all around and mr <UNK> <UNK> he's gotta be my tony someday
<START> is the story of a token black man on the board of directors of a large advertising firm who is accidentally voted <UNK> of the board when the owner of the firm <UNK> over while trying to <UNK> out an idea that he was apparently quite excited about of course takes his new role to heart and fires most everyone in the agency hires a new crew all black except for a token white guy and proceeds to <UNK> out the most offensive and non pc commercials one could ever ask for now it's a rather <UNK> crew he has and despite that they somehow manage to be successful while <UNK> in the cash i rather like the scene where potential <UNK> are being <UNK> of <UNK> of cash and then told to get out and their commercials will follow later like them or not the story is good but of course the highlight here is the nasty commercials themselves especially the one for face off <UNK> cream this is rather dated but still a fun movie and full of hilarious moments robert downey sr was working for an ad agency doing experimental ads at the time and i guess this was his middle finger to madison <UNK> <UNK> very good and pretty damned funny 8 out of 10
<START> usually when a television biopic is released on a celebrity its at the very least campy i e <UNK> shepherd as martha stewart lauren bacall as doris duke this is the most horrendous cheap and boring television movie ever made if <UNK> 1 is going to make a television film they have got to spend a little more money on them <UNK> alexander though gifted with the michael voice is not a great dancer does not resemble michael one bit and does not even have his mannerisms down <UNK> 1 would have done better by hiring an actual <UNK> that way when see michael go into get plastic surgery he doesn't actually come out looking exactly the same why should we be taken <UNK> at the <UNK> of michael's nose when its exactly the same size as in the beginning of the film the woman playing elizabeth taylor cannot act and looks nothing like her and don't even get me started on the woman as janet jackson terrible script and a severe case of <UNK> needs to keep <UNK> 1 from producing any more movies <UNK> alexander would have made a much better <UNK> jackson rather than michael costumes trashy <UNK> <UNK> spliced together footage from news <UNK> don't bother with this one its not even remotely worth it the one good piece of casting the actor portraying joseph jackson and maybe the actress as lisa marie <UNK> though she should have been more <UNK> than <UNK> girl
<START> of course this came out right at the beginning of the 1980s of course it did those drama students dancing in the street to irene <UNK> famous theme song it's an <UNK> eighties leg <UNK> style image but there's more to the film than that there's <UNK> and one man's struggle to learn to read and a struggle with sexuality and an attack on a child and one girl tricked into taking topless photographs and <UNK> of suicide in the end though it is also about that song
<START> the reviewer in variety said this was <UNK> and overlong and i kind of agree with it it has some events that seem forced and unlikely like when cal <UNK> once again as the <UNK> <UNK> and kind of male and <UNK> moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place the story is one of those 1970's guy must find meaning in his life stories and i found myself imagining jack nicholson in his prime playing the role of cal the whole hitting the road to find meaning in life theme is still kind of interesting though does it all really lead back to family i wasn't so sure the acting is okay i particularly liked karen allen and james who unfortunately only have supporting roles i'd give it a
<START> absolutely fantastic whatever i say wouldn't do this underrated movie the justice it deserves watch it now fantastic
<START> there are two things that i noticed in this film this is not a spoiler just a mistake in storytelling when cole takes bill to his first b e he finds the box as soon as cole finds it he says the box everyone's got a box a minute later just before he <UNK> the <UNK> on the floor he says we're actually very fortunate you don't see these often br br observation 2 spoiler alert br br i had to watch the thing three times i couldn't figure a couple of things out then i watched the <UNK> version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time br br that was a good thing because i don't know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflix br br color me obsessive
<START> being 15 myself i enjoyed this flick <UNK> i related to the character ann august more than most would my mother <UNK> as eccentric as adele but the feelings of <UNK> is the same this movie is perfect in the aspects and <UNK> and <UNK> performances are so linked together that it's the best <UNK> <UNK> i have seen in years their chemistry brings the characters to life they become real people i would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away because there is alot of people out there who would wish to be anywhere but here including me and if you can see this movie with your best friend or your mother its the tears that blend everyone around you together more
<START> this flick is a waste of time i expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shooting van <UNK> acting is awful he never was much of an actor but here it is worse he was definitely better in his earlier movies his screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners the whole dialog in the film is a disaster same as the plot the title the shepherd makes no sense why didn't they just call it border <UNK> the fighting scenes could have been better but either they weren't able to afford it or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideas this is a cheap low type of action cinema
<START> as anthony said i wanted to stick my head in a bucket of pull my <UNK> out and jump off a cliff this <UNK> my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort <UNK> self indulgent <UNK> and just bad bad beyond <UNK> what else can i say if you are unfortunate enough to be in an area where this piece of idiotic trash is playing please please have mercy on soul and avoid at all costs
<START> this movie was <UNK> pc predictable and clichéd i couldn't imagine a movie that better <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of today's hollywood if you haven't seen this don't bother watching it if you have show some courage and tell people how awful it really is my wife a minority in her own right was offended by the inherent and racist message of the film this movie has nothing to do with the real world and has little if anything at all to add to any discussion about racism in this country instead it's the kind of cheap <UNK> crap that is promoted as deep and challenging thought what kind of a bubble do you have to live in to think that this is at all impressive
<START> another fabulous movie from catherine this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie using comedy  a new genre for  we get a <UNK> view of filmmaking but in documentary style the character who plays the director in the movie is based on the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film <UNK> ma as is the main teenage actress but the film like all of work is not entertainment alone it is <UNK> with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as <UNK> a devotion to as opposed to pornography that is a <UNK> of work and a devotion to real emotion we see the director character <UNK> the young lead actress and actor to bring the best out in them <UNK> them into the parts they need to play bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they cannot see in themselves until they achieve the heights of acting that she demands of them she makes meaningful movies not <UNK> but she shows the work that is needed to produce this and so gives us insights both into the decidedly french film making process and the psychology of male  female sexuality
<START> i myself am a physics student and i have to say i think this is one of the best <UNK> to string theory that's out there the elegant universe manages to make the entire topic of string although it's actually m theory accessible to a wider audience br br some <UNK> <UNK> feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end throwing technical <UNK> at them without so much as an explanation and presenting the theory in a boring stale style this programme goes through concepts such as general <UNK> and quantum <UNK> and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale br br i suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra <UNK> and <UNK> but the thing is that's against the point explaining string theory from the start is <UNK> on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base and the way it's explained in the elegant universe is clear and entertaining br br whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially <UNK> by some of the ideas that greene presents extra <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life are they but if you <UNK> with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today and if you're studying physics well it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more
<START> first of all i just have to say that i'm a huge lost fan everyone who makes the show i love 'em it's got everything in it really br br i'm glad that they have great people making it for instance jack <UNK> is the greatest director well maybe after j j <UNK> and of course full credit to damon <UNK> they're geniuses br br anyway the season 2 finale is definitely one of the best episodes of lost ever live together die alone focuses on <UNK> david <UNK> story of getting to the island and henry ian is so great playing that character the makers of the show would have been very stupid if they would've let die on us br br so in lost the plane crash survivors have been there for <UNK> days <UNK> days man <UNK> has been there for sixteen years and the others have been there for god knows how long referring to jeffrey <UNK> <UNK> anyway i hope we'll get the answers we need in season 3 can't wait my vote is nine
<START> this film easily rivals the emotional strength the dramatic impact and the top notch performances of 12 angry men i rented it on a <UNK> and was amazed that i had not heard of it before br br i do not know if this was <UNK> directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character <UNK> plays all suggest a natural eye br br the interplay between martin and <UNK> contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and <UNK> a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord she is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time br br there are some moments where i feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between <UNK> and his ex girlfriend almost seem written for another film <UNK> comes off as another character all together but those are minor complaints br br this film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences i rate it 8 out of a difficult 10 br br
<START> the gimmick as it were of this 1934 paramount comedy is the six comedy performers paired off into three man and woman teams who all appear together w c fields and his frequent screen partner appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a small town sheriff and <UNK> fields seems to have been given the <UNK> to <UNK> plenty of his own one of a kind brand of <UNK> surreal comedy into his part and it works wonderfully especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine a <UNK> that is totally welcome since it is hilarious br br at first thought it might have seemed like a <UNK> to <UNK> of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of charlie and mary <UNK> next to the broad <UNK> vaudeville <UNK> of the great husband and wife comedy team of george burns and <UNK> allen but here it works perfectly because of the parts george and <UNK> are given in the script they are there are <UNK> <UNK> a ride to california on and honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step including brilliantly while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear life br br making burns and allen comic <UNK> to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their far out larger than life comedy characters into a real world setting the comedy of people <UNK> to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a gold mine as <UNK> famous naive delivery itself br br charlie deserves special mention for his performance as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he's <UNK> subtle and <UNK> and draws laughs from lines that in another actor's hands might not even have been heard br br the script is wonderfully witty all through and most of the way it's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our <UNK> are with the poor who can't get a moment alone and the extra bonus is that what <UNK> them is just more first rate comedy material from burns and allen br br for the pre code <UNK> out there there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes as tries to get across to george just why he and his wife want to be alone for a while br br there are a few signs of a rushed production here the occasional jump cut one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie right up there with w c <UNK> own short the golf <UNK> and the <UNK> in <UNK> tie is constantly changing in shape these don't bother me though and they shouldn't bother anybody who is enjoying the film br br six of a kind is a real little known gem and one of the funniest movies i've seen in a while if you're thinking about whether to watch it the answer should be yes
<START> wow just wow there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own i agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing <UNK> boy does it ever however i think there is some other problems here br br 1 why is christian belief and the <UNK> for <UNK> life <UNK> <UNK> the film acts as though you just can't be a christian and also allow for the possibility why they ever so briefly touch on this in the film i e the bible doesn't say there is aliens well the bible doesn't say there isn't but the actual <UNK> is never answered the bible really doesn't say there isn't so how about dealing with the question instead of <UNK> it out of hand or better yet acknowledge that this is an <UNK> universe we live in and if we believe in an <UNK> god there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them br br 2 how come the only two explanations for the <UNK> that are valid are demons and <UNK> what about sleep <UNK> and night <UNK> which have been linked to <UNK> experiences what if it's something else entirely too bad the film makers already have their minds made up br br 3 the film makers claim that all who have had <UNK> experiences have had ties to the occult that's a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present i'm not necessarily arguing that they don't but if you're going to say something so <UNK> you'd better have the facts to back it up br br 4 why does the other reporter not the <UNK> haired blonde guy the other one always have his hands in his <UNK> it's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing pocket pool br br i wish this had been an exploration of christian faith and <UNK> <UNK> but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their faith message to care much about make a thought provoking movie as a christian myself this <UNK> me
<START> i am appalled and <UNK> that the network has canceled talk show with spike br br what is wrong with the fox television network <UNK> talk show with spike and replacing it with <UNK> <UNK> for those at the network with a short attention span <UNK> at large was canceled because the audience grew tired of her nasty insults that would make the audience cringe and <UNK> sykes <UNK> out her very own brand of <UNK> mud <UNK> jokes is not humor it is nasty and repulsive br br apparently the fox television network has rewarded <UNK> <UNK> because she has garnered a self important appearance front of president <UNK> there is no doubt that <UNK> recent ill <UNK> in front of the president of the united states are not funny and the audience laughter was only to <UNK> and please <UNK> br br talk show with spike has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or <UNK> insulted any guest or performer <UNK> well rounded personality always <UNK> <UNK> fun of life and himself and his <UNK> pieces during the first two seasons with <UNK> actress mary mae <UNK> as the mae west of the 21st century were absolutely hysterical with spike skits judge joe brown <UNK> <UNK> and last <UNK> james lee episode where spike <UNK> with <UNK> via the internet on the show br br despite the <UNK> budget constraints for elaborate field pieces and the second <UNK> <UNK> strike spike did not his sense of humor or show integrity talk show with spike always had up in coming new talent and his comedy for <UNK> spoofs of <UNK> <UNK> and idiot <UNK> were considered cutting edge and had excellent production value br br on a professional level spike was the best executive producers and set producer brett <UNK> along with his fabulous production crew were one of the best production teams that i have worked for in my <UNK> career it would really be very foolish and sad shame to <UNK> talk show with spike br br unfortunately its success could <UNK> be taken to comedy central or another network and <UNK> speaking that would become a valuable <UNK> loss for fox television br br on behalf of the late night saturday fox television audience supporters of talk show with spike including all cast and crew we <UNK> the network to retain the talk show with spike franchise and give the crew a second opportunity to become a successful fox show
<START> co scripted by william h macy from arguably donald e <UNK> best and hardest to find novel a travesty very faithful to the story the movie stars macy as a hapless man who gets in way too far over his head after attempting to cover up an accidental death <UNK> adam arkin and james <UNK> in good supporting roles the strength of the movie is in the intricate twist after twist storyline and in the acting particularly by macy who <UNK> and delightfully breaks through the 4th wall here and gets away with it every time a good storyline with much dark humor this one engaged me enough that i've watched it three times in the week since it came out prepare to your critical <UNK> and <UNK> a loud
<START> i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you you are alone is that movie for me the film is constantly in my head and in my heart i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again as if i am seeing it for the first time br br there is nothing i did not like about the movie amazing soundtrack the ending was perfect very emotionally stirring it was compelling and riveting br br i <UNK> jessica and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed i admired strength what a strong woman br br the tag line is when your darkest moments come to life we never know what we are capable of doing everyone says oh i would never do that when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation we are very capable of anything and this movies <UNK> straight into that subject the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part br br thank you for a perfect piece of art
<START> this the the final feature film that <UNK> antonioni directed with the help of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> from his short story collection that <UNK> alley on the beyond the clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that we've come to be <UNK> to from his earlier works and sums up those themes in vignettes which are <UNK> together via <UNK> directed scenes involving john the director character however most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we're used to from an antonioni movie while narration of supposed depth <UNK> on with unclear <UNK> that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place br br nonetheless all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight perhaps due to the lack of time since they're short stories anyway to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical antonioni movie and the obsessive approach here is for the characters to <UNK> to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship br br the first story story of a love affair that never existed tells the romance between <UNK> kim <UNK> stuart and carmen who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel and later meet at a <UNK> it's as if fate is playing games on them when they meet but part and meet again much later but like the games people play it's almost like a <UNK> or a la <UNK> with the lack of communication and of the expectations from the man br br john director character takes central role in the next short who <UNK> some really <UNK> looks toward a girl working at a shop played by sophie she is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable but somehow <UNK> up the courage to approach him and in what i thought was to scare him off tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times but in a flash these two are off toward bedroom <UNK> br br the next short don't look for me is the longest of the lot with peter <UNK> playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress <UNK> <UNK> or his wife played by <UNK> <UNK> perhaps the more star <UNK> of the lot with jean reno also stepping in for a <UNK> at the end of it which sort of <UNK> the little universe in which this short exists but unfortunately <UNK> involvement also got <UNK> to some <UNK> of laughter as it goes into the implausible <UNK> with laser quick romantic there was a key element adapted from <UNK> with a kiss between a couple through a glass <UNK> too while the <UNK> tale about the story of souls was quite interesting if there's a negative theme here this short wants to play upon it'll be the <UNK> of man br br in between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from la <UNK> <UNK> mastroianni and <UNK> <UNK> where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in red desert finally we have the final shot this body of dirt with vincent <UNK> as a young man going after a girl irene <UNK> whom he just met and falling in love with her only to realize that it is a love that is too late it's a relatively <UNK> piece just like the first story with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they're in which sort of brings to mind richard <UNK> before sunrise br br while on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the excuse to link them up was a film director's exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film
<START> the crew of an american submarine discover it's hell below while fighting in the <UNK> in <UNK> br br although nearly forgotten this excellent war film still delivers solid entertainment thanks to a <UNK> script superior performances and highly believable action scenes br br robert <UNK> walter huston play submarine officers under the stress of war who quickly are at odds with each other with dramatic and tragic results since <UNK> is in love with <UNK> daughter <UNK> evans in a well played role the situation becomes even more complicated both on shore and beneath the waves the viewer is torn between the two strong characters one of whom is <UNK> by his heart and the other by the rules br br robert young makes an effective appearance as <UNK> buddy sterling <UNK> creates a brief vivid portrait of a doomed <UNK> br br eugene <UNK> as the <UNK> master jimmy <UNK> as the cook make for a very funny comedy team and provide the story with plenty of laughs <UNK> nose comes in for lots of <UNK> and his obsession with amateur <UNK> leads to some chaotic encounters with british br br movie <UNK> will recognize babe london as an <UNK> italian miss <UNK> <UNK> as the wife of a british <UNK> paul <UNK> as an italian <UNK> all uncredited br br mgm has given the film absolutely first class production values with the <UNK> sequences especially well produced both the claustrophobic of the ship and the inevitable tension associated with submarine <UNK> are accurately portrayed other moments of unexpected drama <UNK> miss evans caught on top of a <UNK> <UNK> wheel during an air raid and hilarity <UNK> boxing a <UNK> are expertly <UNK> into the fabric of the movie to provide a totally satisfying viewing experience
<START> i am seldom motivated to write a review unless inspired by the quality of the movie in the case of <UNK> moon i was so uninspired i felt the need to warn others how bad this tv mini series is here are a few thoughts br br the indians they came across like they were in a saturday night live skit making fun of how indians talk when writes dialogue in his novels it reads so interesting i am not sure how they ended up with what they got br br gus looks like from the old <UNK> series acting is ok and the mannerisms from robert <UNK> are right on but the look is pure comedy cowboy br br clara maybe you could use a little dirt or sweat on her next time ever been in austin in the summer before air <UNK> i promise you women did not look like that do you think they never saw any episodes of br br <UNK> elisha again whenever they are in the <UNK> office it feels like a saturday night live skit and the skit is bombing br br <UNK> call call is the most reasonable character of course he talks so little how can you screw up that but hey what about that hat br br blue duck see above and include the fact that he isn't even a tiny bit scary they should have gotten <UNK> <UNK> to play the part br br the rangers right out of o brother where art <UNK> i expected george to come riding up and them to break into a song br br perhaps i am <UNK> because the miniseries isn't completed but i doubt i will watch any more of it any way br br i would not expect anyone to be able to <UNK> the enthralling feel of <UNK> <UNK> but i watch this and it seems like they have no feel for the old west at all
<START> after reading previews for this movie i thought it would be a let down however after i got my region 1 dvd the dvd was available before the film hit the uk cinemas i was pleasantly surprised strong performances from all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie the fact that the script is quite weak means that you dont get <UNK> down in story and therefore the repeat viewing factor is greater i recommend this movie to one and all br br
<START> a moderately interesting start some pretty scenes in <UNK> century japan and a promising idea but the execution the comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is cannibal women in the <UNK> jungle of death really a <UNK> in oriental history who doesn't speak any japanese walks on without <UNK> her shoes and is generally dumb as <UNK> please this looks like a student film the sets are <UNK> the acting except perhaps for the title character close to wooden the plot utterly <UNK> at least cannibal women was funny this is best watched with someone who knows something about japan just to watch disbelief repeatedly crawl across their face
<START> years ago i caught a fairly well made tv movie entitled linda it was made in 1973 and starred stella stevens in the femme fatale title roll imagine my surprise when over ten years later i once again saw the same story unfold on late night tv however it was this 1993 version starring virginia madsen don't get me wrong i can handle remakes even obscure ones but this badly written and poorly filmed <UNK> made me feel sorry for both madsen and co star richard thomas unlike the original the dialogue here is cliched making me wonder why did they bother to re write it second the camera work is very heavy handed and the the film stock is poor at times i felt reminded of the student film competition at the beginning of christopher <UNK> the big picture finally the cast looks either bored madsen or suffering thomas in fact the only one who seems like he's really enjoying the work is ted <UNK> of course with his perfectly hair and <UNK> teeth he's really <UNK> himself from his previous work on the love boat bottom line to borrow a critique from <UNK> the penguin in bloom county br br this movie does for film what <UNK> did for <UNK> aid br br
<START> i'm really disappointed by this piece of work it is quiet shallow keeps repeating itself is mostly not exact and sometimes on the verge of being wrong i think it's made for <UNK> school especially because it keeps repeating itself over and over again while leaving large gaps a young kid might actually enjoy it and learn from it but a better way to make a kid appreciate <UNK> physics are books like a short history of time or the <UNK> of physics if you are familiar with the topic on a very basic level you won't gain any new information or views from this series don't waste your time with it nice eye candy though
<START> the <UNK> before me stated this movie is the worst that was ever forced upon him her as a child i have to say though that i loved this movie when was little and i still love it today the movie has the best running theme of all family <UNK> considering the time period the movie was released i thought the movie was acted out well i only wish i could still find a copy of it somewhere of all the 1980's films i watched as a kid this was on of my favorites i know i probably watched it at least once a week with my brother and my mom i would definitely recommend it to anyone i know or don't know so if you do find a copy of it i suggest watching it it's wonderful and heartwarming
<START> well what can be said about a horror comedy that features neither horror nor comedy there are no characters in the film but much too many plot lines all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous br br the computer generated creatures look bad a bit like disney versions of <UNK> rats without a tail the walking dead are the biggest rip off apart from the title the shall look like the dead in movie but are far removed they just look like bad actors with of plastic and <UNK> blood added br br two plot lines really showed some promise the love story and the company story but failed as miserably as the director the writers the <UNK> department the production and the actors
<START> i'll start by <UNK> that i tend to really enjoy action movies military or other i'm a guy but this dreck was awful i saw it for free showtime or hbo and still feel i paid too much it was a prolonged episode of general hospital br br i gave it a 1 only because 0 or 0 1 was not possible how or why <UNK> others would give it a rating of between 5 and 6 <UNK> my mind unless they are all family of the cast or crew br br it might be this movie was so bad many <UNK> out and as such were too to bother br br i'm sorry for repeating but the 10 line minimum seems silly for what essentially <UNK> down to a warning in hopes of saving others the 2 <UNK> black hole this movie represents trust me stare at a blank wall they'll be more action
<START> a recommendation gloria <UNK> runs the kind of <UNK> where discipline is <UNK> with a meat <UNK> <UNK> are hung on meat <UNK> to <UNK> them and the bodies are kept in the deep freeze so that they can be brought out for when social services call that the <UNK> is <UNK> for cash we know because gloria puts all the <UNK> to work and also because there don't seem to be enough clothes to go round especially for the older <UNK> female <UNK> age range appears to be 12 30 ish the new arrival however turns out to be more than a match for gloria and has indeed just taken out her own mother mother's lover in a witty claw hammer and <UNK> opening scene predictably gloria ends up on a meat hook herself this one was made for about but was is a huge huge huge hit on the <UNK> circuit my dvd cover promised disturbing and politically incorrect scenes and it sure wasn't lying i believe it is regarded as the citizen kane of <UNK> set torture porn movies 4 10
<START> this is the greatest movie if you want inspiration on following your heart and never giving up on your dream elizabeth taylor is <UNK> and in her prime of her childhood at least mickey rooney is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her <UNK> and they go off to the grand national with her beloved horse the <UNK> short for pirate only to have <UNK> become the <UNK> and have a chance at victory to those of you who have not seen it yet i won't give away the ending but you should see it and once you do you'll love it notice a very young angela lansbury as <UNK> sister
<START> i was first introduced to this movie while in san antonio <UNK> this movie was the 2nd in a double feature unfortunately the theater where i saw this was torn down anyways five fingers of death aka king boxer was released in 1972 and introduced in the u s the following year like a lot of other kung fu movies released while riding on the coat <UNK> of enter the dragon this particular movie actually was pretty good it's the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts <UNK> to better himself his fighting skills meanwhile the <UNK> martial arts school plans scheme to <UNK> our hero <UNK> dirty tactics to try to throw him off track try to prevent him from <UNK> in the <UNK> by surprise i had thought since warner bros distributed this movie in the u s warner bros was going to issue a dvd it never happened as far as i know this movie has been released in both english w sub titles the latter a more <UNK> <UNK> version although the fighting sequences are a bit funny to watch i e flying in air hitting jumping on buildings a fighter using his head literally to hit his <UNK> etc nonetheless it's classic kung fu action wonderfully planned executed if you like enter the dragon five fingers of death would be an excellent addition to any movie collection if you can find it
<START> is an exploration of reality and virtual reality <UNK> characters run from realm to realm landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games calling into question which reality they arrive from is the real one br br of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality instead <UNK> the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end i'm not even sure <UNK> pretends that twist won't be there it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of <UNK> br br the problem with this film though is its base nature in a sense <UNK> is questioning reality and <UNK> game play yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him <UNK> in it the violence the <UNK> the lack of focus and in a sense the even if there isn't such in the film i have once heard someone state that <UNK> violence is actually a criticism of in media but he hides that well with the fact that he <UNK> such incredible pleasure in ripping new <UNK> into humans animals and <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br what is brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game <UNK> not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice versa all of that stuff along with the <UNK> of <UNK> it definitely <UNK> the video game reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd but it does it even better by replacing video game <UNK> with literal <UNK> of <UNK> matter that <UNK> and shift and are frankly disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees for what it's worth this film causes a reaction in you br br but what for it <UNK> virtual reality but it's a movie it is its own virtual reality it seems to criticize the <UNK> of video game plot lines and character design yet it maintains that <UNK> it definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life and yet i say again it <UNK> the <UNK> pleasure from ripping people objects <UNK> things and <UNK> into bloody <UNK> br br so whereas it has a key focus of angst it doesn't really do anything with it not really only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can't really be denied its own moment of <UNK> br br in a sense it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent because there's no good reason i can see for loving it and yet i can't disregard it as mediocre or bad it'd be easier to simply not be able to take it but since i can there's nothing i can really do with it i do believe it is a little excessive it really didn't need to go as far as it went but <UNK> intentions are so mixed up and confused i don't know if that was <UNK> flaw or <UNK> point and i don't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly br br <UNK>
<START> <UNK> this was immensely boring the leading man christian has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen and another thing if the character in the movie moved to america when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years he would speak a lot better english than what he pulls of here or to say it in my own language but it is cool to see norwegian <UNK> in a movie made in hollywood it was just a damn shame they were talentless <UNK> the storyline itself is below mediocre i have a suspicion that christian did this movie just to live the dream as he clearly does in the film by <UNK> one beautiful babe after another
<START> this fantasy was utter garbage i thought michael moore <UNK> the market on ridiculous anti government movies but this one was far worse than anything he ever did no wonder critics of the british media complain it's driven by <UNK> <UNK> this movie is a left wing greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen anyone even slightly to the right of such <UNK> bush <UNK> should be appalled it ever got funding to be made i'm sure it will do well in <UNK> iran <UNK> and north korea though it's hard to believe that in these days of insane muslims blowing up innocent there is anyone in the u k who thinks britain should surrender in the war on terrorism i guess it's no longer the country i admired for standing alone against the nazis nearly 70 years ago all <UNK> <UNK> chamberlain and the pathetic policy of <UNK>
<START> half a mystical thriller and half the <UNK> fantasies of a fragile mind guardian of the frontier is an engaging trip that soon <UNK> strong imagery and a compelling premise is soon overwhelmed by incoherent plotting hackneyed dialogue amateurish acting and the most outlandish and over the top <UNK> imagery in recent memory here a fish is most definitely not just a fish evidently this is the first <UNK> feature film to be directed by a woman ms <UNK> must have been determined to prove that she could be as lurid and <UNK> explicit as any man
<START> in the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple hulk hogan would take on <UNK> <UNK> or bobby <UNK> or ted <UNK> and come out <UNK> more often than not occasionally he would get an ally like randy savage in 1988 but mostly it was all about hulk hogan vs bobby and that's the way it should be br br but on this night that was about to change a new champion a man who the wwe thought would be their man for the 90s was <UNK> it didn't work out but the wwe was right about one thing was finished and a new order needed to be established br br this historic <UNK> the first to be held outside america kicked off with rick <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> b <UNK> <UNK> never really had a lot of luck at <UNK> and was taken down in short order here br br next up the <UNK> connection andre the giant and <UNK> put their tag team titles on the line against <UNK> <UNK> and smash and lost new tag team <UNK> <UNK> br br next match saw <UNK> defeat <UNK> <UNK> was another fellow who didn't really have a lot of luck at <UNK> plenty of luck for <UNK> <UNK> as he ended mr <UNK> streak well i guess someone had to end it br br <UNK> <UNK> and bad news brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match next up the hart foundation defeated <UNK> and boris <UNK> in 19 seconds not really a match unfortunately the barbarian then defeated <UNK> <UNK> in a short match br br the american dream dusty <UNK> and then defeated the macho king randy savage and queen <UNK> in a messy mixed tag match this was the only female wrestling really going on in the wwe at this point of time br br next up was a fun match as the <UNK> marty <UNK> and shawn <UNK> defeated the <UNK> express in a fast paced encounter there were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time jim <UNK> then beat <UNK> bravo in a nothing match br br next ted <UNK> put his most <UNK> possession the million dollar championship on the line against jake roberts roberts was distracted by <UNK> and counted out allowing ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show br br next up the twin towers <UNK> as the big <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in short order this is followed by rick rude winning a short match with jimmy <UNK> br br finally we come to the main event with hulk hogan putting the wwe title on the line against <UNK> champion the ultimate warrior this is an entertaining back and forth match won by the warrior after hogan missed a leg drop the crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle br br and so the torch was passed but would the ultimate warrior prove to be the champion the wwe hoped he would be
<START> the first <UNK> film was dark gory and <UNK> this film is un gory battles to <UNK> jazz music no real gore at all and the worst <UNK> mask i have ever seen his deep voice is now a light happy voice characters from part 1 <UNK> by actors that look nothing like them claire mom characters names change claire or sara it is lacking all the brutal violence dark humor and political <UNK> of the first film if it weren't for nudity this movie could have been rated pg really lame i am a huge fan of part 1 though just cant stand this one
<START> after their star cross country runner dies after a race the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death br br from the beginning of this film it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good at least as far as true quality goes the track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events i've ever seen in a film it would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life not just run track but run at all ever from there we get a horribly unrealistic female navy member who was breaking numerous appearance rules with her jewelry and make up not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging loose onto her collar while in uniform ridiculously awkward camera angles <UNK> done gore effects and acting that <UNK> from <UNK> over the top to <UNK> under done all in one actor mind you all help to make this film one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films ever made on the other hand the writing wasn't all that terrible and the story was actually okay but the direction was horrible made worse by <UNK> bad cinematography the acting <UNK> from acceptable to just plain abysmal regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements however there's something here whether it be cheese or something else that i can't figure out that makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch maybe it was just white br br obligatory slasher elements br br violence gore death scenes were fun enough but the gore was just awful blood <UNK> from impossible angles no actual or wounds from knives etc but this film has the first <UNK> by scene i've ever seen br br sex nudity there was a bit of nudity i mean <UNK> <UNK> is in it after all and some overly horny high <UNK> but nothing to excess br br cool killer s if you think leather <UNK> stop watches track suits and <UNK> masks are cool this one is for you br br scares suspense not really any at all there is one moment that takes place in the girls' locker room that i was preparing myself to be scared at but it just led to some typical stupidity and was ruined for me br br mystery a little but if you can't figure out the killer's identity about 20 minutes into the film then i'm not too sure about your powers of <UNK> br br awkward dance scene there's a great <UNK> jam session <UNK> day blues with a guitar <UNK> that leads to some awesome 80s <UNK> this is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the scariest part of the film br br final verdict 4 10 don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it just like most everything else troma touches br br <UNK>
<START> this time the <UNK> marc singer returns only to face off a new enemy wings <UNK> however due to an annoying teenager <UNK> they are transported to the future where they then duke it out lots of lame fish out of water jokes ensue you honestly don't get sequels this rotten to the core <UNK> 2 is a painful movie to behold the references and <UNK> date the film badly this was made in 1991 and really who wants to see the <UNK> in the present times also of note is wings <UNK> who's embarrassing performance is easily the film's best asset singer looks awkward is irritating and the whole 1991 <UNK> just makes the movie downright unwatchable this is easily one of the worst movies ever made br br 1 2 out of 4 awful
<START> it reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert a brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score the landscape develops its own persona <UNK> the inner <UNK> of all three characters as their stories unfold the stark void of lost love the fear of the unknown and then <UNK> of <UNK> through the very <UNK> of this <UNK> three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space the drama is compelling james franco and his co stars deliver <UNK> performances naive <UNK> <UNK> blonde <UNK> car thief all <UNK> with unexpected twists together they create an explosive portrait of <UNK> love one that <UNK> to <UNK> amidst the hardest forms of <UNK> and illusion the <UNK> of human emotion
<START> if this is <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> of london then the producers must be on different planet br br it is the most depressing <UNK> dark <UNK> <UNK> on tv br br everyone is fighting everything has nasty under tones running through it nothing is done for genuine reasons br br if you want a real life picture of people in london or the uk then this programme is by the <UNK> from reality br br there is not one good word i can say about this programme the only <UNK> is that will be a great big fight over christmas dinner br br even the characters are totally unbelievable
<START> in a world full of films like you got served that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors you'd never figure that there would be worse films until now ron <UNK> vampire <UNK> does more than cheese you off it knows that you are mad at it first there are no <UNK> in this movie in fact there's only one good guy fighting in the whole movie second the location is basically one location some <UNK> house or basement it's up to you third the special effects <UNK> stated can kiss my ass fourth the acting beats plan 9 from outer space in the worst acting ever category ron hall can't act to save his life finally and definitely not the smallest problem the editing the person who edited this film better hope that i never find him the cuts and shots are horrendous other issues lighting virtually none the fact that the guy on the cover isn't even in the movie and the fact that this film exists br br to sum this film up let us just say that i tortured the dvd copy before taking it back to hollywood video don't worry i used the <UNK> <UNK> so it was free never see this film
<START> this was a great 1981 film which had a great story about three men and two girls who go on a camping trip together and go through thick woods and high mountains with a great water fall this group of people run into property owned by george kennedy roy <UNK> who plays the role as a forest ranger and rides a white horse roy <UNK> warns these young people that where they are going is no area for camping and they should turn back of course these young people pay no attention and proceed to have a ball swimming in the nude near the water fall and playing great music and dancing by the fire and having plenty of beer and wine there is an old wooden one room school house that draws the <UNK> and guys inside and it is from that point on the film starts to get very scary there is one occasion when a young girl has to climb a tree in order to get away from a human beast who desires her body and starts <UNK> the tree down in order to capture her don't miss this film there is plenty of everything
<START> on account of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere i have not gotten to try any of the other entries in the series although i certainly would not mind and trust me i have looked for anyone who does not know this is a point and click adventure title that means that the mouse is what you use to <UNK> with everything that you can do so with in this though there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate i won't spoil it here for anyone who haven't yet tried it nevertheless regardless of how little experience you have with computers you can sit right down and try this there isn't even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift <UNK> heck you can <UNK> the speed of the text if you have it have subtitles on and thus of the talking in it and it's not enormously awkward or forced when slow your <UNK> is easy as well as combining or using items <UNK> and holding down the button at anything you can affect gives three <UNK> for what to use with it be it a person a specific part of the surroundings or an object hand push pick up open etc eyes examine look through etc and mouth eat <UNK> etc this all adds up to a <UNK> friendly environment where you can approach the <UNK> <UNK> the amount of them is varied based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this on at your own pace and explore and take in the dozens of individual <UNK> done characters and areas in this to your <UNK> content the length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do such you'll hear no blame from me they're worth it and your skill at <UNK> out the <UNK> there are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of <UNK> that or not this can be enjoyed by anyone from any age there's no material that isn't acceptable for children this is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is <UNK> for older audiences the animation is quality work smooth everything moves as it should and the 3rd dimension honestly isn't that sorely missed when trying this the story telling is well done and you're never unclear as to what is going on there are numerous well directed cut scenes kept in the same colorful mostly bright <UNK> world as the rest with well done camera motion <UNK> is an appropriate word to describe this and not only the visual style it can be applied to all of this the entire world of this is very similar to but not quite the same as <UNK> with a mix of past and present inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of but the absurdity makes them funny that would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this right there it's hilarious a lot of that comes from the lines spoken what is said as well as how it is and those who dig british efforts with focus on verbal the likes of <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> franchise will want to check this sucker out however there are several different types of jokes including but not limited to the following satire <UNK> dark spoofs irony gross out comedy not exactly my favorite aspect of this and more there's self awareness with the lead addressing you personally and for example explaining why he isn't going to do what you just asked him to there are references to pop culture through a couple of decades almost all of it works hardly any gags fall flat and if you aren't in <UNK> during this my best guess as to the reason would be that it's simply not <UNK> with your sense of humor a situation that <UNK> no judgment and if one suspects that could be the case and wishes to find out i suggest the <UNK> version where you for free can see if you care for the brand of play and or laughter the plot is well written nearly all of this is really develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well the audio is all excellent crisp and well done the sound effects are spot on the music is well composed with no exceptions the voice acting is impeccable with a celebrity or two is fantastic as gotta love that name whom you control <UNK> is incredible as the deceased and still threatening zombie villain the designs are immensely well done highly imaginative and all fit in spite of the relatively limited <UNK> of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds you do get to engage in some steer a ship board that of others and match <UNK> in a rather unique and <UNK> thought up way the re lies mainly in the choices during dialog etc this is linear with a tad freedom as far as the order goes so the <UNK> sitting down with this for at least the second time has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime ah nothing is perfect anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly well crafted and fascinating fictional universe and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this the good kind not the ones that hurt and potentially leave <UNK> don't forget kids do not eat books that is just begging for a paper cut i would <UNK> a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one too and they're not the only ones who may get into this i recommend this to apart from members of aforementioned group any fan of this genre of as well as anyone to whom this review appeals 8 10
<START> what can i say about this film that won't give you any <UNK> notions when you see it very little the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down what follows after that is the movie it is one of the <UNK> most mind blowing films of the past several years everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended it is not a perfect film the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confused if you've read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere you'll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to <UNK> what actually is going on i'm not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror and don't mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl
<START> sebastian <UNK> is a rich jerk who wants to buy up all the land because there is oil though none of the locals are aware of the oil with the help of an evil <UNK> in black they kill and <UNK> everyone when the son of a murdered man arrives he refuses to back down and stands up to these forces of darkness br br wow as i watched terror in a texas town i felt as if i'd seen this film many times before and would probably see something like it again that's because aside from a few <UNK> such as sterling hayden using a <UNK> on the bad guy it has a plot that is too familiar once again we've got a rich guy who is trying to drive out all the <UNK> in order to gain control of all the land and to do so he's brought in hired guns to force people to sell or kill them been there done that in just too many films br br i love sterling hayden in films but just couldn't recommend this as anything other than a poor time <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is the best bogart <UNK> ever dry and <UNK> as sam <UNK> the music from award winning composer george <UNK> from here to eternity <UNK> the world of <UNK> wong the cinematography of perfect locations including the famous <UNK> hotel are all right on target as famous tv director robert day <UNK> streets of san francisco the <UNK> <UNK> the most endearing group of well known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made see this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor this one is a hoot
<START> my friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of the only good that came from it was this movie take it to limit right as the movie started we could tell we were in for a true classic the music is probably done by rural white boys from <UNK> but it sounds just like early 90's rap the star of the show actor leo <UNK> plays the bad boy so well especially sporting a big <UNK> the entire movie this movie is based on climbing and i'm not a <UNK> yet even i think it's hilarious when they have the <UNK> struggling to climb and there's a guy in the background who is basically walking up the you don't want to miss this movie you'll get to see the same clips over and over again you'll get surprises at every turn you'll find yourself <UNK> the unforgettable lines i highly recommend this movie to anyone take it snow <UNK> this movie is poorly done but that is what makes it great
<START> considering the <UNK> reputation as truly the worst of the worst i was looking forward to watching <UNK> my word <UNK> not necessarily any more inept than the other woods <UNK> watched â however being from the <UNK> madness 1938 school of film making <UNK> or glenda <UNK> come across as readily as his genre efforts br br also this surely emerges as horror legend bela <UNK> his first of three with the director one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was considering the history of heavy <UNK> and the sheer <UNK> of his cameo besides <UNK> delivery is perhaps at its most awkward script is mostly to blame for this â given the impossible dialogue with repeated nonsensical <UNK> to dog and fat he handed the <UNK> star by the way wood himself plays the central role under the <UNK> daniel davis â and being just as worthless in this area proves to have been an all round dog <UNK> fuller â his wife and co star â was similarly <UNK> she would also appear in jail bait 1954 at the very least the image where the latter finally lets <UNK> wear her <UNK> <UNK> did give tim <UNK> biopic ed wood 1994 its famous poster br br incidentally the latter film features a presumably <UNK> meeting between wood and orson welles â well for all <UNK> and purposes <UNK> or glenda <UNK> ed citizen kane 1941 given its <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> narrative techniques in fact the <UNK> thread of plot is padded with stock footage <UNK> many of it irrelevant such as the <UNK> instances of s m and inane dream sequences <UNK> by the presence of an <UNK> demon sporting outrageous <UNK> <UNK> that would make martin scorsese <UNK> with envy the <UNK> sincere attempt at a <UNK> for tolerance and psychological <UNK> into the <UNK> phenomenon of <UNK> is however <UNK> at every turn by the sheer <UNK> of the approach br br for what <UNK> worth the edition i watched was the re issue which included six minutes of footage directed by w <UNK> <UNK> on original release furthermore my copy went out of <UNK> every so often which forced me to <UNK> it slightly to get the audio back on track â though thankfully this was the fault of the source <UNK> to <UNK> as opposed to the film itself
<START> as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism after all fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw <UNK> to make this another carey success after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in the idea that a charming charismatic top v i p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible the actors seem confused with the situation as well of course the stereotypical rich <UNK> head of the operation doesn't struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro obsessed with <UNK> the next minute he's a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able quite happily to put a gun to another man's head jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going br br the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never <UNK> in a character that has so many <UNK> holes to his personality carey shines when he is presented with a strong daring character man on the moon the truman show ace <UNK> which this film never presented him with despite its best efforts
<START> okay i <UNK> that a film by <UNK> about <UNK> for <UNK> would be a disaster waiting to happen but little did i know how so very painful it would be a little known fact is that <UNK> have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films the <UNK> official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that <UNK> the mormon community including the wonderful short film <UNK> in the snow which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70's then there's neil <UNK> <UNK> masterful <UNK> br br however the success of these films <UNK> largely on the fact that they didn't focus on <UNK> or any specific mormon <UNK> instead they <UNK> to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level god's army <UNK> any <UNK> of <UNK> and runs <UNK> into the stilted and <UNK> world of the <UNK> while this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted mormon director richard <UNK> as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge god's army unwatchable by almost any standard br br own <UNK> wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting <UNK> you're ever likely to meet of course the <UNK> sorry performances aren't helped any by pathetic script he should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the church but as can be expected he conveniently frames these <UNK> in a sympathetic light it should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the <UNK> darker side are addressed with little other than faith at one point an african american <UNK> is <UNK> by a black couple for joining a church that was <UNK> up until 1978 some ten to twenty years after nearly every <UNK> in the most <UNK> parts of the deep south had already done so instead of addressing the <UNK> <UNK> racist history perhaps the spot in mormon <UNK> which even church leaders don't defend anymore troubled character instead <UNK> joseph smith's murder an obvious and perhaps outrageous <UNK> to <UNK> top off this <UNK> with third <UNK> <UNK> jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent films br br if you knew little about <UNK> before watching this film you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs if you are mormon this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about
<START> quite possibly one of if not the worst film ever conceived cast and acted in the history of cinema who on god's green earth would ever think to cast cameron diaz and james as a couple she looked like his mother god forgive me but i am just being honest and that was the least of the many problems <UNK> this horrible excuse for a film it was a horrible statement against women but at least if you're gonna blame women for the problems of the world tell a decent story not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and thrills everybody should get their money back who went to see it in theaters or bought the dvd
<START> tough luck follows a homeless drifter as he becomes <UNK> in the underground crime world of deception and chaos <UNK> norman <UNK> has been released from prison and has nothing to lose he is almost killed before the owner of a carnival named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hires him for work soon <UNK> <UNK> a strong desire for <UNK> to murder his mischievous wife an erotic dancer for the carnival things soon get complicated when <UNK> falls in love with and warns her of the scheme they become involved in a very steamy affair that leaves little to the imagination of the viewer after which they soon make a plan together they plot to murder <UNK> but things don't go quite as planned br br i would be lying if i said that this film didn't surprise me i was personally blown away by how good this film was upon renting it several years back i was expecting another cliché thriller with a lot of the typical elements and themes that are shown in a lot of films of that type these days within minutes i was hooked and found myself quite involved with the world of this film it's the kind of film much like buffalo <UNK> that just sucks you in and <UNK> you into the style and the feeling of paranoia it is a film that really pulls it off in stunning fashion one thing i particularly appreciated was how the film depicted it's characters the film isn't as easy and clear cut as it may appear in the plot summary these are characters that you actually grow to care about and are fascinated by including the characters that are supposed to be the bad guys in truth there are no good guys or bad guys in this film all of the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true to life there aren't many films that manage to accomplish this task as <UNK> as this film does but it's definitely a film style that i like and i want to see more of from films today there were quite a few crime films that were like that back in the early 50s but there hasn't been one as gripping and unique as this ever since br br in terms of flaws i have mostly very minor <UNK> the film itself isn't exactly original however i doubt that most folks would expect it to be original the film's editing style also may be irritating to some folks as it tends to have a camcorder type of shaky <UNK> throughout while i wasn't bothered by it and actually felt that it added to the atmosphere i'm sure most viewers will not be as enthralled by it and may find it generally off putting despite the minor flaws however this is one of the most underrated films of the <UNK> it's so refreshing to get lucky and watch an unknown film that turns out to be good it seems as if this film was a direct to video release though this film is far better than that had it been put in theaters it wouldn't have won any awards nor would it have been seen much but it would have a lot more recognition than it has today recognition that this film deserves tough luck is an astounding entertaining and twisted neo noir thriller with a real sense of class and style <UNK> and with enough substance to make the average <UNK> more than simply satisfied
<START> no one can argue with it this is and will be the best movie ever as it is the perfect definition of what any movie should be a collective <UNK> beyond times no movie can give you more perfectly this impression that you carried it inside you even before you saw it for the first time br br there are images that stay forever
<START> slight spoilers this installment of the full moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and <UNK> some new elements first off a new puppet master is established secondly the puppets turn good in this sequel finally it introduces some scifi fantasy elements as well br br a new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay his girlfriend her psychic friend and that <UNK> boyfriend stumble upon andre <UNK> puppet <UNK> they also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds <UNK> responsible for stealing the secret to <UNK> the so the demon sends the <UNK> a bunch of craven little creatures that look like ear less <UNK> then it's up to the puppet <UNK> to take care of the inter dimensional threat that's trying to kill there new friends br br like most low budget movies this film is <UNK> with continuity problems how did the puppets get put back in the <UNK> how come nobody remembers the last <UNK> of in the hotel who bought the hotel why would a <UNK> by a building with a history of mass murders all this and many more questions will not be answered ever br br the real <UNK> of this movie is the acting it's actually pretty good the actors take it with a enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of full moon <UNK> hill was especially impressive as the shy nervous psychic lauren <UNK> west <UNK> was also a pleasant <UNK> also gordon hill was a tolerable protagonist but cameron was far too annoying to stomach thank the <UNK> god he dies before halfway through br br the puppets are there usual animated <UNK> with some <UNK> as well there emotions especially <UNK> are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and six <UNK> have all been improved and sound much better the stop motion animation is only average at best especially the <UNK> they just don't seem to move as <UNK> as the previous installment in the series also the costume is absolutely how are we supposed to afraid of a creature so humorous looking br br the story seems a bit for the series i think charlie band was looking to focus in on a younger <UNK> the violence being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same gore fans will be disappointed br br i think the above is the main problem this movie can't really stick with many people it doesn't have the violence for the language is a little <UNK> yet it's too violent and harsh for the wee ones which is why the movie gets low ratings i have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair
<START> this is so embarrassing it's a remake of the wedding singer which happens to be my favorite movie which gives me another reason to <UNK> of this film it has the same plot same jokes same characters <UNK> people need to be more original
<START> and it's a not very good documentary either american movie seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary <UNK> and even some newspaper tv <UNK> described it as such i'll not laugh out loud at that because it's easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala this is spinal tap br br what seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary <UNK> around budding film maker mark who is how can i put it rather self <UNK> yes but that's not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we'd all still be living in <UNK> and the fact that mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both sam <UNK> yes that one and peter jackson yes that one both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it's not a criticism no it's just that mark yes that one is a parody of american trailer trash br br remember in there's something about mary ben stiller gives a lift to a dodgy <UNK> <UNK> come into my office because you're f <UNK> fired well that's who mark resembles along with most of jerry <UNK> guests so it's very easy to see why some people thought this wasn't a real documentary it's also not a very good documentary since mark and co give me the creeps did you know that someone thought mark would grow up to be a serial killer does anyone else think there's plenty of time left for this to happen
<START> rented this out from my local because it was the only new british film available this week never heard of the film maker before or his other films thank you imdb about time some one made a good young british comedy that didn't star hugh grant or forty <UNK> the story is a morality tale but never preachy <UNK> enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast luke cameo was surprisingly very good but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in loved the colour <UNK> especially in the night club sequences great music and a truly original voice at work here nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge

<START> a film first and foremost should be good storytelling it should be entertaining and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean laughs and it doesn't necessarily mean light it basically means you're not bored while watching it br br as brilliant as 2001 may be it is a difficult film to watch especially for the current video game playing <UNK> <UNK> generation its slow pace and the sometimes <UNK> amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action e g the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space will stretch your patience on the other hand the cinematography is brilliant the film cleverly directed the ending thought provoking and the score the score is chilling especially as the crew in the <UNK> approaches the <UNK> on the moon boy i had <UNK> <UNK> big time this doesn't happen often when i watch films and is a testament to kubrick's directing skills br br it is considered a classic and many people consider it the best science fiction film of all time that alone is a good reason to watch it if you haven't done so yet however just because everybody else thinks it's a brilliant film doesn't mean you have to force yourself to like it you either will like it or you won't perhaps the slow pace isn't such a bad thing after all directing your attention to something rather static and slow paced for 2 1 2 hours might teach you a lesson it will certainly be a different experience to all these fast moving fast paced images we are subjected to these days whether commercials music videos or video games br br i myself think it's a memorable film but not one i'm eager to watch again anytime soon unless i'm in a particular mood for slow paced films br br hence 7 stars out of 10 from me
<START> less than zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage <UNK> in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book but where they hadn't this movie presents does the job and leaves you with the <UNK> feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with larry <UNK> movies <UNK> and ' br br societal <UNK> teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma they don't treat it much like one when their estranged friend daniel <UNK> boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the <UNK> edge in their suburban town keanu reeves may be the only <UNK> character among the bunch the only one willing to exhibit any sort of conscience anyway while the others either don't do anything about the girl's death or want to help their friend hide the body br br i don't know who is more sick in this film <UNK> glover who becomes nearly obsessed and quite <UNK> in trying to protect the friend and hide the crime by <UNK> him out of the state dennis hopper an on edge drug dealer who <UNK> to a female <UNK> doll that befriends the teens as a dealer of course and suddenly becomes involved in the events or josh miller who plays <UNK> little brother tim he appears to be the most <UNK> of them all at least until his emotional breakdown at the end it is definitely not <UNK> 80s teen fare obviously and certainly makes the point strikingly clear about the serious <UNK> these kids deal with despite a bizarre series of events thanks to many great performances all around even reeves proved some acting <UNK> br br help yourself to a comedy to recover if it rocks you too hard
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is betty a kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse who is <UNK> with a soap opera actor greg kinnear and who is married to del a cheating stupid male <UNK> who's trying to sell some stolen drugs unfortunately for him he gets brutally murdered instead while betty secretly watches it leaves her unhinged believing that kinnear is really the character he plays dr david and that she is his <UNK> ex fiancée she heads for la to find her lost love not knowing the stolen drugs are in her <UNK> pursuing her are charlie and wesley morgan freeman and chris rock respectively the hit men who inadvertently killed del before they found out where the drugs were hidden they pursue her across the country while charlie gradually falls in love with his image of her br br and in la things get totally bizarre as no one realizes that betty is <UNK> alternately funny and touching this movie is almost perfect stop reading <UNK> and go see it
<START> this is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy peter <UNK> who's living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy 27 years ago br br in his prison cell <UNK> <UNK> to his wife the <UNK> events of 27 years ago and how he came into contact with wayne kennedy the man who he supposedly killed br br from here the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about wayne and <UNK> and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you get br br the acting isn't anything to crow about although the guy who plays wayne kennedy is pretty creepy enough the real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain the wife spends the movie running around digging up clues to the mystery and each time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more of the mystery it's actually pretty well br br so as far as lifetime tv movie's go this little flick comes highly recommended br br enjoy
<START> watching this hilariously retro but very entertaining career girl tale i was <UNK> by joan <UNK> first appearance all i could think initially was my god it's the same face as michael jackson in his notorious <UNK> photo br br about <UNK> minutes into the movie diane baker and hope lange get out of a cab in <UNK> village as they walk down the street you can see part of a sign in back of them for the <UNK> bar scene of the <UNK> <UNK> that are considered the trigger for the modern gay rights movement br br speaking of baker and <UNK> i had to laugh when she gets into one and tells the <UNK> and <UNK> place please and be careful of the <UNK> can you imagine the reaction to that from a driver in today's manhattan she says that of course because she's pregnant and doesn't want to hurt the <UNK> but that doesn't stop her from jumping out of a moving car when she finds out bob evans wants her to have an abortion well they had to find a way for her to lose the baby 1959 and all br br sue carson is delightful as mary <UNK> why was this her only movie there is no <UNK> information on her in imdb
<START> i have been watching movies from i think last 10 years and i must say that i never felt that bad which i felt after watching this extra large bore movie it was bad very bad there were songs songs nobody should watch this movie the director has shown germans speaking english which is so rubbish germans does not speak english in one scene there was a white girl who asked <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> that he must have gave some money to her in the <UNK> they have shown prepare for laughing riot but i could say there was only one scene where that <UNK> was laughing for no reason may be he thinks he's funny is very good she is like an angel but too young only 16 <UNK> old if you have plenty of time and don't know what to do then you should watch this movie or else its waste of money
<START> warning slight plot spoilers ahead br br the italian job is not the best movie you'll see all year or probably even this summer but it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines knowing its limits and not attempting to <UNK> them br br what carries the movie is the work of the cast in a movie about a crew of thieves the individuals must have a good <UNK> with each other without that cohesive feel the audience doesn't believe in the characters <UNK> or <UNK> and the movie never has a chance but from the first scenes in which the men joke around and <UNK> on each other while <UNK> a <UNK> palace the proper chemistry is in place br br the characters themselves aren't anything novel they're your basic gang of criminals containing about half a dozen players each with a specific and defining skill but each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part mark <UNK> understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind <UNK> edward norton provides attitude and <UNK> his mustache well in his dark role donald sutherland is the father figure of the crew and he looks the part of the suave and old fashioned thief who is still mentally <UNK> jason <UNK> seth green and <UNK> <UNK> don't do much beyond their character's abilities but they each nail those parts <UNK> as the smooth operating driver green as the tech <UNK> geek with a chip on his shoulder and <UNK> as the <UNK> man <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in well in a part that doesn't ask too much of her she is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good that she does none of the characters are that deep or three dimensional but in this familiar sort of movie two <UNK> are all that is required br br as the title implies the movie has a european feel to it a la the bourne identity in part because it was shot on location in <UNK> along with philadelphia and los angeles also <UNK> to the euro flair is the <UNK> <UNK> music which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and <UNK> the <UNK> of the cast the look of the movie is also a perfect match the bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude the <UNK> not only provide a fun variation on the car chase but also work as a necessary plot device br br the plot is more or less straight forward there are a few surprises but they are more of the swift and smooth turn variety as opposed to the drop your jaw <UNK> <UNK> even with those the movie <UNK> along once the foundation is laid by the first act everything continuously progresses thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance something the movie wisely avoided there aren't even any breaks for <UNK> life ' the story has its purpose and runs that course without <UNK> the lack of character depth <UNK> the italian job from being more than a good popcorn movie but with all the complex details of the heist planning such would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flick br br there are a number of <UNK> that i thought of both during and after viewing but the movie is so enjoyable that i didn't and don't care in the real world most of the movie probably couldn't have gone off that <UNK> but the italian job doesn't take place in the real world it occurs in a stylish and light hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us br br the italian job is a movie in the true sense of the word it has no <UNK> of oscar and contains no deep moral message it provides pure <UNK> entertainment and does so quite well br br bottom line maybe the best popcorn movie of the year so far 7 of 10
<START> possibly the worst film within the genre in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply <UNK> pathetic i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically <UNK> to it is toilet humour at its very <UNK> i would avoid even watching the trailer i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged i am still <UNK> how one can honestly believe such a statement rarely do i leave the cinema really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me this one did it in just 30 minutes
<START> there are a lot of <UNK> films out there tune in to channel 5 every night of the week and you might just be treated to a daily shocking effort from one filmmaker or another there are possibly films that have caused me more pain were harder to sit through than this but in terms of writing acting direction cinematography and the bare <UNK> of cinema is a truly truly appalling effort and should be avoided at all costs the only laugh it gave me was in the behind the scenes documentary on the dvd in which the film's geeky director darren fisher explains how it was his script that attracted the <UNK> to the project never <UNK> the power of self <UNK> br br darren fisher <UNK> answer to edward d wood jr
<START> if you consider yourself a horror movie fan chances are you've seen <UNK> <UNK> ring and dark water they're superb and <UNK> making its way smoothly into hollywood maybe dark water will be adapted soon too while ring is almost 100 pure heart <UNK> and nerve breaking a tale of two sister is both nerve breaking and mind <UNK> br br along with the other i consider this korean flick a brilliant and smart ending horror movie the only flaw this movie has is some consider its first 20 minutes rather slow it's actually typical with korean and japanese movies i consider it carefully planned rather than slow think of it as calm moment before the storm with <UNK> introduction of characters imho viewer will get involved more <UNK> with the character one of korean and japanese movies strongest point br br like ring a tale of two sister doesn't <UNK> ghastly appearance rather they let our mind do the <UNK> job itself that way it's and <UNK> classy at the same time i won't be surprised if hollywood remakes this movie after bringing ring and grudge <UNK> on over this flick is not that good by the way i rate it 5 5 don't miss it
<START> so many of us who are devoted to the art of the motion picture will disregard or forget that movies are also business <UNK> most of the time they are far too <UNK> to produce to be anything else in light of this it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then once in a while the film makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the <UNK> responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt <UNK> and will of course become very angry about this i'd like to know precisely how it happens that this has often led to both the big studios and some major critics <UNK> for the picture when it is at last released terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds their perception of what they are viewing br br you can see this phenomenon at work in the <UNK> but magnificent <UNK> re make <UNK> <UNK> on the bounty and you can definitely see it in the reaction to <UNK> gate <UNK> took too long and cost united artists way too much money in making this picture the company was <UNK> wounded by his <UNK> and no doubt powerful people were out to see his reputation forever ruined when this strange <UNK> epic was finally released there are always many film goers who dislike long <UNK> pictures the storytelling in this film is not accomplished with great economy or a <UNK> pace like stanley kubrick <UNK> often chooses not to spell out the particular statement he is making with a given scene rather he draws it out in such a way as to make the viewer feel like they are living in the moment providing time for his own imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented a lot of folks don't react all that <UNK> to this approach they want the story to move quickly and clearly and they easily become <UNK> and confused by this sort of film these factors <UNK> contributed to the box office failure of <UNK> gate br br by nature a film editor i am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film here and there a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been <UNK> without <UNK> its <UNK> then we come to the massive drawn out battle scenes at the end of the picture where these are concerned the clarity of the storytelling is indeed damaged if you liked the film up to the point where these occur your understanding of what is supposed to be happening is likely to become unclear and this is indeed a frustration not having seen all the rough footage i can not tell if actual re shoots would have been needed or whether some critical plot elements might have been made <UNK> by careful re editing of some moments given the time and money that were <UNK> into this picture more care and thought should have been given to this problem br br there are other problems some occasional weak acting some dialog that doesn't ring true but these are really minor concerns the reason i am so troubled by the problems stated above is that like so many these days i too feel that in all <UNK> gate is so splendid to behold and so <UNK> deals with major historic political and <UNK> issues that it is just short of a masterpiece despite its shortcomings it is so dramatically and visually powerful that it stands head and shoulders above most other hollywood films i have ever seen i'd like to re mix a lot of the sound i'd like to re direct and re edit the scene where ella is killed but the greatness of this picture is such that these <UNK> really do become trivial when compared with the value of the total production i should add that it should always be seen on a giant wide screen to achieve the glorious effect that it is so capable of delivering
<START> <UNK> is an <UNK> to summer camp those of us who got to go to camp will see many of the scenes as we remember or wish they could have been br br bill murray plays senior boys <UNK> harrison who really runs the camp he reminds us of the funny cool staff member who everyone loves young <UNK> <UNK> toward him and if he speaks to you you feel like you are family this is one of <UNK> best roles he drives the film with his one liners and ad <UNK> br br chris <UNK> plays <UNK> the loner <UNK> who is taken under wing and breaks out of his shell br br the rest of the <UNK> and staff in the film were excellent as well br br the overall theme of the movie is the underdog <UNK> obstacles to finally win from <UNK> to <UNK> to the camp and even to himself the <UNK> of the film are the stars the movie has heart br br the film is fun and funny without being cruel or <UNK> as some teen movies are today the cast look and act like real people br br the comedy and heart draw you in to the point that at the end just like at camp you are sad to leave br br in my summer camp experience we had underwear run up flag <UNK> mystery meat trying to sneak a <UNK> into the girls cabin the lunatic with the hook stories around the camp fire and moving sleeping people out of their <UNK> and putting them elsewhere but we also had a dedicated camp staff <UNK> us to be the best we could be br br my favorite scene is the overnight when they are <UNK> across the lake singing a goofy song the one line that cracks me up every time is when is <UNK> light outs the evening before <UNK> day and he ends tomorrow is parents day and you must look <UNK> or <UNK> will be sent to the state <UNK>
<START> warning this review may contain spoilers br br the idea behind the character of danny jet li is a good one young boy is taken by <UNK> and raised to behave like a vicious <UNK> controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck br br however the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability br br he has danny meeting a blind <UNK> sam morgan freeman who has to be the most <UNK> fool a man ever was along with his <UNK> wit endlessly <UNK> rather unattractive step daughter victoria <UNK> <UNK> i was stunned by the way when i learned victoria was supposed to be 18 she looked 25 or 30 to me br br amazingly there is no romance between danny and victoria br br when danny turns up again wounded what does sam do but take him straight home danny is out for 2 days but do these <UNK> wits take him to a hospital <UNK> i don't know if they even called in a doctor br br now danny is obviously not a mentally stable person this is apparent from the get go yet sam takes him into his home where both he and his step daughter could have been seriously <UNK> or even killed by this rather strange young man br br why morgan freeman took this insipid role in this <UNK> film i can't even begin to guess surely mr freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck br br then we have bob <UNK> as bart the gangster who owns danny now you talk about a son of a gun that's hard to kill the car bart is in gets <UNK> with bullets that would have <UNK> bonnie and demise we think he's dead but no br br then we have another car accident and yet again ol' bart escapes <UNK> br br in addition to that we also have danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time plus a scene where danny has decided he doesn't want to fight any more i don't care how much a person doesn't want to fight when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die i think anyone would fight br br as i said in the subject heading this film is about 40 miles outside the <UNK> of reality as we have come to know it it's not just a case of <UNK> belief it's completely beyond that br br furthermore i never did understand why <UNK> mother who turns out to be a nice lady rather than the prostitute bart claimed she is became mixed up with bart and his gang and got shot maybe that was my fault i got distracted right about the time that scene came on but it seemed highly unlikely she and bart would have ever crossed paths br br 4 stars out of 10 and that's being generous
<START> i am a fan of good historical fiction and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction but when you have a book you are adapting it would be nice to actually follow the plot line br br the portrayals of the the actual emperor and his 2 sons <UNK> and was horrid they acted like a cookie cutter <UNK> and were the <UNK> <UNK> in this adaptation there was a scene with <UNK> <UNK> justice as if he was <UNK> from the movie of the same name the way the are portrayed in the books mostly follow the reports of historians writing in that time period they were fair and sane not <UNK> by the <UNK> insanity br br helena the love interest of marcus <UNK> gives as her reason for <UNK> one of the <UNK> <UNK> in the title was that he was a <UNK> yet in the books it was because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who <UNK> her as a person br br marcus in the movie gets a slave named yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment let alone afford a slave there was certainly no romantic <UNK> between the nonexistent slave and a female gladiator br br on the whole if you want good cookie cutter roman stereotypes get <UNK> if you want good roman from the classical history viewpoint get i <UNK>
<START> i'd honestly give this movie a solid 7 5 but i <UNK> 10 to try to <UNK> the 5 pages of <UNK> <UNK> 1 star reviews this is an interesting story all of the acting is good to very good even ms diaz who is totally out of her usual <UNK> bimbo role here yet plays it well the sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy it's a fine morality play and there is no reason to explain the origin of the god supernatural being alien whatever that's running the show so i'm glad the movie doesn't try it's really irrelevant to the story which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite <UNK> in the ending br br before you decide this movie is terrible or really anything under a 7 5 read some of the dozens of 1 star hated it reviews that are <UNK> with <UNK> lack of <UNK> and and juvenile criticisms maybe the trailer was misleading or something i didn't see it but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting terminator 4 or saw 5 one reviewer actually compared this movie to saw how utterly inappropriate and unrelated br br seriously most of these reviews read like you tube comments according to these critics this movie is too confusing yet too predictable not enough action yet there's too much going on too smart yet too dumb explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained oh and it's apparently a <UNK> <UNK> of time do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart i'm afraid these 1 star kids failed to understand the phrase <UNK> and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movie's premise despite <UNK> claiming that they get it right before explaining how confusing it was if you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding and enjoying this movie br br i really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so i could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie 1 star forever br br see it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral test and facing the consequences it's a good time in my opinion
<START> i really enjoyed this movie and i usually don't like animated pictures but i thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming there is a good song called everybody wants to be a cat that is a lot of fun it has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure i think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film
<START> i am not a big music video fan i think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song any song in other words creative thinking goes out the window likewise personal feelings aside about <UNK> toss aside this was the best music video of <UNK> simply wonderful it was a movie yes folks it was brilliant you had awesome acting awesome choreography and awesome singing this was spectacular simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man but was he a man or something sinister vincent price did his thing adding to the song and video <UNK> was <UNK> enough said about that this song was to video what are for cars top of the line what was even better about this was that we got the real <UNK> without the thousand though ironically enough there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around folks go to youtube take 14 mins out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is
<START> the man with a golden arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction the other two were monkey on my back and a of rain but i think of the three this one is the best br br maybe if otto preminger had shot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet who knows maybe preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the location it's the only flaw i find in the film br br frank sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was <UNK> for covering for his boss robert <UNK> when the game was <UNK> he took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer but a whole lot of people are <UNK> against him br br first bob <UNK> who wants him back dealing especially because a couple of <UNK> <UNK> are in town he uses a few <UNK> methods to get sinatra's services back secondly darren <UNK> is the local <UNK> dealer who wants sinatra good and hooked as a <UNK> again and finally <UNK> parker his <UNK> wife who's working a con game to beat all just to keep him around br br frank sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film but lost to ernest <UNK> in marty sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn't won for from here to eternity in the supporting actor category a few years back and that marty was such an acclaimed film in that year his scenes going through <UNK> locked up in kim <UNK> apartment will leave you <UNK> br br <UNK> parker does not get enough credit for her role she's really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost if she had not been nominated that same year for interrupted melody she might have been nominated for this 1955 marked the high point of her career br br darren <UNK> got his first real notice as the very <UNK> drug <UNK> his performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl br br elmer <UNK> contributed a great jazz score to <UNK> the general of the bleak chicago neighborhood the characters live in not a place you'd want to bring up your family
<START> my partner and i had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a shot picking the title from a list of movies on cable without knowing a single thing about it as it opened and revealed the cast we thought well how bad can it be kathy bates jonathan <UNK> rupert everett <UNK> redgrave dan <UNK> and more as the story <UNK> we became more and more <UNK> with our selection and the film soon had us laughing out loud throughout this is not a great film but it is one of those rare films that has such a great combination of memorable characters taken through truth is stranger than fiction type surreal events that i couldn't help but love it i had no problem <UNK> my disbelief at some of the <UNK> story elements because the intentions of the filmmakers are so warm hearted while they still manage to poke fun at everyone involved as others on imdb said this is a comfort movie and i too wouldn't be surprised if it became a cult classic
<START> warning plot spoiler br br the always <UNK> movies of david <UNK> certainly are an acquired taste fans of his earlier films will probably like but it definitely isn't one for the <UNK> all of the usual elements are here a game <UNK> made out of skin hooked into your back <UNK> of blood a gun made out of bones and a manic mechanic to name but a few the result is good in parts bad in parts and just plain weird in others but one thing the film has is <UNK> originality br br despite the excessive use <UNK> weirdness it does prove a point virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people in the movie a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was <UNK> assuming that she was still in the game but it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an <UNK> in this stunningly life like game leads to a conclusion that can be <UNK> to in several ways br br despite some extra <UNK> and <UNK> it was simply your classic it was all a <UNK> or was <UNK> twist it is a smart surprise and answers a few questions but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing at only <UNK> minutes it could have went on a bit longer too in a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way br br jennifer jason leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while but her character doesn't have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character jude law on the other hand <UNK> with a curious american accent is good as your average joe sucked into this <UNK> world we see the film through his perspective br br is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember there's <UNK> of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of david lynch what next being consumed by a question mark it definitely isn't for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend my imdb rating 6 2 10
<START> i must say when i saw this film at a 6 5 on this site i figured it was well worth a view i was sorely disappointed from nearly the opening scene it is obvious the two supposed fbi agents are in fact the killers could they have made it any more obvious if that is the intended twist in this film that's pretty sad while <UNK> and <UNK> are excellent actors even their talent is no match for a <UNK> bad script <UNK> <UNK> acts the part of a <UNK> killer and that's the problem there is no switch from i'm playing fbi guy to i just killed 12 people and boy are my arms tired you can't blame the actors the story fails in far more ways than one br br from the <UNK> of the film however i was certain i was wrong that no director writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot twist <UNK> and <UNK> must just be acting strangely in order to <UNK> the viewer's attention from the real killers i thought which gave the film's makers far too much credit i should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15 minute mark br br to lynch's credit she did manage to <UNK> many things that make a good film sex violence humor and well trained actors too bad they were in the wrong <UNK> hopefully james can recover from this role i found her performance particularly impressive as the stunning drug addict turned would be <UNK> she should have <UNK> the role so the crack whore would win br br those people who have compared this film to natural born killers take note tarantino made the characters of mickey and <UNK> <UNK> yet sympathetic the artistry of that film far <UNK> the gore and this is not seen once in <UNK> <UNK> only wishes it were natural born killers in fact it has wet dreams about being even a <UNK> of what that film was folks who haven't seen <UNK> stick to something with a little more intelligence like camp rock
<START> the journey is a very good film produced in the spring of 1958 in vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years despite the political problems which influenced the movie's success because the story happens during the hungarian revolution the cold war the journey is a very good film but not well known i think it should be released immediately on dvd because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home one of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between deborah kerr and <UNK> <UNK> their intense relationship all their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters major and diana another quality is the script which is very well written it was even published as a novel by the screen player george <UNK> the film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end at first we didn't know if diana and the other <UNK> could leave <UNK> because the communist major discovers that <UNK> friend paul is hungarian and he isn't allowed to leave the country the major falls deeply in love with diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesn't want to let her go but after he <UNK> her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go and the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed the major and diana say goodbye she arrives at the frontier with all the <UNK> including paul while is shot several times by some <UNK> so he dies <UNK> <UNK> is very very handsome and deborah kerr is very beautiful charming <UNK> just like an english lady <UNK> and deborah are perfect together they are one of the greatest couples of the golden hollywood a true <UNK> should watch this film the journey has everything that a good film should have a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction <UNK> <UNK> is in my opinion at his best finally i want to give a message to warner bros studios or those who <UNK> and release classic films please release the journey on dvd as soon as possible
<START> i'd heard about this movie but didn't see it until my daughter who saw it on a flight to australia told me it was a great movie i was interested in seeing whether rupert away from harry potter was showing the promise you see in the potter movies i wasn't disappointed he's become a fine actor showing a range in driving lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over bearing obsessive mother to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own and other's <UNK> going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging actress <UNK> it's obvious that he's ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage but the jewel of this movie was julie <UNK> i'd seen her previously in the potter movies billy elliott and <UNK> girls and loved her in driving lessons as she does lines from poetry and shakespeare i was <UNK> by her timing command of the language and body language i'm hoping it was make up <UNK> as she portrays an older woman with though no mention of it is made in the movie as a nurse i can say that she did this perfectly portraying a woman on the brink of old age but <UNK> to the <UNK> past that she <UNK> in this is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time and i wish i'd seen it in a theatre first but i doubt it ever played anywhere here in <UNK> we miss out on so many of these types of movies here
<START> it's hard to make a bad movie with the underdog finally succeeds sport theme but this movie succeeds admirably my mind <UNK> at how pointless and boring this film is br br i guess the director couldn't decide whether this was about the runner or the coach it ends up being about neither ultimately who cares neither character has a likable personality there is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone even the bad guy isn't really bad i think he's in two scenes and seemingly is on some kind of i think he asks her once and <UNK> to leave the coach and train with him then later he <UNK> asks her to move in with him that's it conflict tension what will she do br br and what's with the depiction of running has the director ever seen an actual marathon <UNK> form is so incorrect it's absurd as is the form of the supposed champion she <UNK> with a character with no lines maybe they could have hired you know an actual runner br br and the speed the run at is beyond <UNK> were they running or speed walking it's actually laughable i can literally walk backwards faster then they were running in the big race maybe it was too hard to move the cameras at real speed br br another absurdity spoiler i guess at one point in the big race the two women in the lead inexplicably fall at the same time what they fell on is a mystery maybe they both just got exhausted and fell down and then they get up but don't start running again for maybe 30 seconds oh yeah very realistic this ridiculous event doesn't even add any tension since the other <UNK> are not close and besides at this point you have been <UNK> into a state of <UNK> br br i especially enjoyed how all four of her male <UNK> highly trained <UNK> all drop out of the big race due to charlie horses or pulled <UNK> or something just as improbable br br but who cares this movie has almost no tension no resolution nothing some woman runner with absolutely no personality is discovered by an old boring coach with some past failure that is barely hinted at they train a lot she is not happy they train some more she wins da big race <UNK> br br my description is actually more interesting than the actual movie i just saved you 90 minutes avoid this one like the plague
<START> walking with dinosaurs is absolutely brilliant in every regard kenneth branagh <UNK> in a way that really makes you want to listen the script for the documentary really sounds as though the <UNK> and writers had done their <UNK> it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go the music is also brilliant very dramatic when it needs to be but the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well the scenery is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real thanks to the simply astounding effects this is so informative with such a good concept and <UNK> not only adults but kids too br br in conclusion this is a must watch not only did i love this but this is quite possibly the best documentary i have ever seen if anything it could have done with being longer other than that this is perfect 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> first of all let me make it clear this movie is a real piece of garbage but although it is a real piece of garbage it is an better piece of garbage than it could have been it could have sucked big time but it doesn't br br what this movie didn't have was for example scary moments good acting and a good script it wasn't very entertaining either but the movie had cool music fancy locations and hot girls it also works great as a dracula spoof hope it was meant that way although i really don't think so br br the story focuses on three girls in <UNK> <UNK> an ancient vampire which then <UNK> and kills the girls one by one sounds familiar yes so it does br br after reading through this you may think that i should have given it a better vote the reason i don't is because i almost felt asleep at some points
<START> what a boring movie while it did have humorous parts it was just plain boring and lengthy for a 90 minute movie i believe that the cause was a lack of action br br when i rented this movie i expected to see white blood cells combat the evil <UNK> but no such luck it was more that the virus was <UNK> than defeated br br the movie had promise but since made for little <UNK> in mind it did not meet its potential in my opinion
<START> i saw this one <UNK> on dvd it had a big picture of sandra on it and said starring sandra and made it seem like she had a big part in it not so she's barely in it she does what she can with the script but that's not much br br the sound was awful by that i mean things didn't go together shots would be fired and the number of shots didn't <UNK> to the sound people talking in a car while it's moving and the shot is from outside the <UNK> but there's no <UNK> noise road noise or any other sound kind of weird br br score was awful it sounded like the same few notes over and over dialog really awful br br acting was awful i couldn't believe any of it fight scenes were like a batman comic without the <UNK> and <UNK> they were really lame the shooting scenes i mean with <UNK> were laughable literally i fast <UNK> through a lot of this movie even then it was too long
<START> i stumbled upon this movie by chance i was traveling a few years back and this movie was on some channel on cable at the hotel late one night not much else on and figured i watch it for about 20 to 30 minutes until i decided to go to bed needless to say i stayed up and watched the complete movie the plot was very interesting and does make you wonder if there had not been ss who did this or at least thought of doing it i have been looking all over for this movie i even sent and email to the production company but the weren't sure that it would ever make it to dvd but said there was always hope if anyone finds this movie drop a note here where you found it as i'd sure like to get a copy some day
<START> this was an awful short film that tries to be funny in a dark way but wasn't funny at all say at a film festival in chicago it really is what the title says and i simply wasn't into it at all the bad storytelling was what did it in if you re wrote it and re shot it it might work this attempt fell in the hole horrible filmmaking
<START> i cannot believe the number of people referring to the lead characters as <UNK> there is no such thing people there are <UNK> and <UNK> and all males in the species are <UNK> and do not have there was even an actual bull but it was like it was another type of animal completely my god this is like drawing human ears on a cat boobs on superman or mickey mouse with blond shirley temple <UNK> even in animation it just doesn't work giving human qualities to the animals is nothing new to be expected but changing their actual bodies into basically a <UNK> figure is bizarre for a family cartoon how many people <UNK> writers producers animators saw this and didn't know any better or didn't say anything it is completely astounding i'm no <UNK> i <UNK> animation simpsons <UNK> <UNK> south park even ice age all the other new ones out there over the <UNK> was great but this is nuts totally nuts i could not accept that that many people are that ignorant i kept hoping for a reason for the in the film an explanation none came and at the end when they hold up this little <UNK> <UNK> half its belly is <UNK> they <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> i nearly <UNK> please writer creator let us in on the joke
<START> going into the movie with the right expectations i somewhat liked this movie like most reviewers who have seen this movie i fully agree that the plot was razor thin clichéd and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie but the dancing sequences were very well done and i really enjoyed the <UNK> of classical and hip hop dance both which i enjoy watching the music soundtrack of the movie was also very good which made the drama scenes more bearable the leads jenna <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were ok as actors but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing br br all in all a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences and this movie is much much much better than you got served in terms of the plot and drama then again that doesn't say much does it p
<START> thomas edison may have done lots of great <UNK> but wtf is this i am sorry but this movie is simply awful the plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point gets <UNK> okay the picture quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper i thought that the early charlie chaplin films were awful okay thomas edison may have been an <UNK> but why did he make this film he could have filmed a baby being fed it would have been better people might say i'm being harsh on the times but would you enjoy something like this from what i have said edison may have made the but why did he make this particular movie well i might sound like a complete a hole but watch this on youtube then you will see this abomination i still can't believe this film is completely awful all in all the worst short film i have ever seen br br rating 1 10
<START> the subject is banal even in 1942 it is war propaganda the <UNK> are among us and they are doing all they can to <UNK> the war effort and to prepare their victory and their <UNK> of power then and their establishing an effective <UNK> state but hitchcock has to make it a real thriller so he <UNK> a first <UNK> that succeeds but one of the victims the friend of the one who dies in it becomes the prime suspect and run away for the <UNK> that <UNK> him to so to say visit the country and discover the <UNK> organization of the local nazis who have <UNK> and support in the top <UNK> society and use the small little <UNK> whites to do the dirty work the chase after the real <UNK> takes our young false suspect from los angeles to new york and to the top of the organization he meets a blind <UNK> who believes his senses to know the <UNK> is not guilty his niece who is a star of the advertising <UNK> but also a frenetic and fanatic <UNK> who only thinks of going to the police then the rich <UNK> and his nest of <UNK> then on the road some sympathetic and friendly truck driver and the long <UNK> of a circus going around and their dwarf <UNK> woman <UNK> sisters and a few other <UNK> of that type and he discovers the target in a <UNK> city an electric <UNK> that provides los angeles and its war industry with the energy they need he takes part as a <UNK> in the organization in the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> military ship when it is launched and finally with some <UNK> creativity and <UNK> grease he and the niece manage to get the whole lot <UNK> up most of them arrested and the first <UNK> a certain <UNK> falls down from the torch of the statue of liberty that one won't <UNK> on the old electric <UNK> chair but hitchcock is not yet in his habit of having a personal cameo appearance in his own films so don't look for him it's well built and well performed but it is only a propaganda film with an extra style br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK>
<START> i loved the movie <UNK> i knew nothing about the movie before watching it therefore i had no outside influence or information to guide me in what i was seeing unfold on the screen in retrospect i would advise anyone interested in the movie to watch it if for no other reason than the quality actors who appear in it do not read anything about the plot story line or <UNK> of the movie in fact stop reading anything further in my comments although i believe they are general and would not spoil the movie for you i don't want to <UNK> the value of the movie to you find your own path of meaning in this film or it is <UNK> in its potential br br in general i found the 3 <UNK> strangers in puzzling as the movie unfolds they could qualify as three entertaining <UNK> from a mental hospital or the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and <UNK> young boy or three angels sent to find the lost angel br br the sick and perhaps dying boy works to convince the three strangers to abandon the search for the lost angel become his <UNK> mother father and take him safely far away from <UNK> no less than 1000 miles he even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be his guardian only one of the three responds to the boy on a positive basis the other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this involvement br br the priest who is <UNK> the sick boy demonstrates a depth of caring for people and a deep conviction toward his faith he <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> and its people he is the light of goodness and hope to both <UNK> and to the movie viewer br br near the climax of the movie the boy and new guardian journey over land to a field where a plane waits they board to find the other two strangers also on the plane in fact one is the pilot the <UNK> start and the plane takes off br br who are the 3 strangers if only one stranger was interested in helping the boy why were all three on the plane where is the plane going did the other two find the lost angel is there a lost angel and if so who is it who are the six men dressed like <UNK> if all of this is just the sick boy's <UNK> dreams how did one of the 3 strangers end up reaching out to help one of the men dressed like an undertaker when he jumped and hit his head neither the boy or strangers had contact with these men br br one or two sentences written under the title telling people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake this is not a spoiler it's statement about advertising only so if you haven't seen the movie <UNK> the questions above show only a few of the interesting and fun <UNK> in the road of thought when you view the film <UNK> if you read the advertising summary of the plot of the movie before you watched it previously maybe you ought to look at some of the questions above and watch it again i know i will br br terry
<START> i hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic it stroke me as just another mainstream show after i watched it i didn't feel the characters at all is this <UNK> <UNK> idea of how terrorism <UNK> the main character doesn't act like a <UNK> at all and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my <UNK> neither of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine one of the members a blonde all american white boy would never be accepted by muslim terrorists in real life another member a french ex <UNK> doesn't quite fit in an <UNK> terror movement on top of this the terrorists have sexual relations to white american <UNK> which i find very strange this is just another stupid <UNK> american tv show it is about just as realistic as prison break
<START> i always say there's nothing like a good movie and i must say this was nothing like a good movie drab dull and tedious it was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end no matter how hard you try to wake up i don't mind the concept of a film without words ie entering a fantasy or dream world but there has to be something there to capture your imagination not just empty images which is what this film is there seemed to be no character development and it jumped so fast from scene to scene that it was hard to <UNK> any story was there even a story you could tell the actors were trying their best but unfortunately poor direction <UNK> all the actors' work it really seemed like a type of cinematic masturbation only existing to pleasure the director and nobody else big waste of time
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed band of brothers miniseries br br formed in july of 1942 on the eve of battle of <UNK> the <UNK> were considered <UNK> <UNK> and suffered horrible <UNK> sometimes as high as 90 prisoners of <UNK> political prison concentration camps soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of <UNK> were all given a chance to join the and prove that there were not <UNK> of the <UNK> with their lives those who <UNK> <UNK> and those who died in battle were considered <UNK> and were <UNK> in the eyes of the law br br this miniseries features a look at one such under the command of an honorable officer who was captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape the <UNK> yet honorable crime boss the fist and his little gang of criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck his anti <UNK> officer father <UNK> priest <UNK> who joins the <UNK> when his <UNK> is destroyed in the house to house fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the <UNK> but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fighting br br although set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic <UNK> and short which was probably the intent of the director in between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and <UNK> the rape of a young woman by one of soldier and then his execution execution for supposed <UNK> periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german <UNK> <UNK> with food and <UNK> the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a <UNK> and other situations feature <UNK> the camera is <UNK> it does not turn away from the <UNK> of war and the <UNK> of human nature nor from raw human emotions the dialog likewise does not <UNK> out the swearing br br the acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written everything from rage to <UNK> to <UNK> to finding a <UNK> of joy to hang on to is rendered almost one complaint might be that some of russian <UNK> and cultural <UNK> may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy but these references are a nice touch of authenticity another complain that could be is an occasional <UNK> and <UNK> of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight <UNK>
<START> how good is this film apparently good enough that they plan to remake it in jean pierre <UNK> who gave us le and the good thief wrote and directed this film br br the film is almost a silent these are men of few words <UNK> to let their actions speak for them they live by a code that <UNK> their every move br br there are some great actors in this film <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jean de let's make love and <UNK> maria el from a <UNK> of dollars a few dollars more the film does not shine on them they are along for the ride that <UNK> has for them <UNK> makes the film they make it better br br you see <UNK> work in the ocean films but they just get the idea the can't make it work like he did a great loss in the seventies but his work remains for our pleasure
<START> this movie surprised me the box is misleading the <UNK> is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading the movie is quite gory well acted and beautifully shot the special effects are top notch and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize this movie came out in 1979 not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest it is a unique take on the dr <UNK> story and one of the better versions filmed the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking but the film doesn't ever really fall apart definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume horror classics and gore <UNK>
<START> do these guys take have a computer kick out these same plots over and over again only the names places and faces are changed to prevent complete boredom <UNK> is handsome and rich but too busy to pay attention to his gorgeous wife a situation she constantly tries to <UNK> her friend neighbor has the same problem so they become interested in each others the grass is always <UNK> throw in a sexy scheming made who has designs on everybody and you get a lot of <UNK> and <UNK> and a <UNK> bowl of an <UNK> plot br br the quality of bodies is pretty high here although not much in the way of contact even <UNK> is shown good late night <UNK> if jay leno can't put you to sleep
<START> this film was sheer boredom from beginning to end ok so i <UNK> <UNK> for raising the worldwide recognition of events in <UNK> but that is all he achieves about 10 minutes into the film i thought oh no here we go again and i could have told you exactly what was going to occur in the next 80 minutes or so patricia arquette was out of her depth in such a role and her acting was wooden and unconvincing mind you being <UNK> with such an awfully conventional script maybe boredom set in and was such reflected on the screen a lot of the film was just plain laughable at one stage <UNK> elderly companion is shot and he is <UNK> on the ground in the next scene he is <UNK> through the forest obviously attempting to break the world 100 <UNK> record or maybe he's just trying to run away from <UNK> if you find it hard to sleep one night then play beyond on your vcr and you'll be <UNK> in no time i very rarely a film as heavily as this but in this case it is completely justified
<START> i've sat through less painful <UNK> than the time i spent watching this film br br if you give it a try thinking it's going to be something in the vein of a guy ritchie flick think again the production dialogue acting script film work and plot were about the worst i've ever seen in a film my <UNK> part in all honesty was the closing credits in all the history of cinema has there never been a better excuse for turning off the tv and going out and doing something better with your life br br have root <UNK> work done rather than wasting your time and money on this
<START> i'm giving this film 9 out of 10 only because there aren't enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science <UNK> seems to believe the admittedly biased <UNK> are making this stuff up but even an <UNK> understanding of resources and the laws of will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil other <UNK> have refused to face the facts of life and have <UNK> read jared <UNK> collapse which is a popular book or any <UNK> <UNK> or earth science <UNK> and you can <UNK> the basic premise of this movie go ahead <UNK> while rome burns
<START> this movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not intelligence and good messages accepted is the story of a kid named <UNK> justin long who gets rejected by every college he applies to his parents are incredibly strict frustrated and disappointed so <UNK> and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college to <UNK> themselves off to their parents as college kids not everything goes to plan and the movie is about them <UNK> it but behind this plot which sounds ridiculous there are good messages morals and a new <UNK> on the american educational system the college they create south <UNK> <UNK> of technology accepts those who did not get accepted anywhere else the message is that you do not need money tradition or fancy books you just need a desire to better yourself they are a completely <UNK> school but what the movie teaches is that thats still ok and different whether its a person or a school is not necessarily bad and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves despite whether they are ' its a message of non and has <UNK> of anti authority <UNK> in as well but not only are messages great its hilarious haha i laughed very hard the humor can be subtle but can also be blatant as well and is a great mix <UNK> beware
<START> this movie is very similar to death warrant with jean claude van damme and also has some similarities to island of fire with jackie chan and i also heard that there is some other very similar action movies but this film has a much better action than death warrant or even island of fire that's right the jackie chan's movie rarely american action movies has such a great action sequences though there was many negative reviews on this film it easily beats most of the action movies of that time who were more successful there were many martial <UNK> scenes david <UNK> was fast as bruce lee in this film and what else was good that fighting scenes were much longer than in most of the american martial <UNK> movies the shoot out scenes were similar with john <UNK> movies maybe not that good but still very <UNK> there was also many impressive explosions and one great chase scene i've seen some other david <UNK> movies but this one yet is the best in terms of action ok this movie has some cheesy moments but which movie hasn't the acting was decent charles <UNK> was incredible and his character was real tough adam clark who played <UNK> and <UNK> who played the main bad guy were also very good other actors acted pretty well too though the acting isn't important in this type of movies if you are action movies fan i mean the real action movies fan who really can appreciate the good action than you must see this film
<START> no i have not seen the original series and i won't compare the two if i had this series is filmed in canada in <UNK> and victoria british columbia the series is well written in a different story each week some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling i loved the <UNK> episode with <UNK> brown and barbara and the episode with the irresistible brent <UNK> as a in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard <UNK> species it's funny how the <UNK> and <UNK> are our favorite evil aliens like v but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally <UNK> in serving the alien species on earth the stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch
<START> the family happiness is <UNK> when the from the beginning rich father ward michael <UNK> gets poor and cannot support the family any longer then the mother faye <UNK> smith has to take the role as the <UNK> in the family and starts to work in order to support the family and at the same time <UNK> alone has to manage the family life not always that good but as good as she can the family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that the son lionel joe stargate atlantis is gay and is living together with his lover john joel the also an old family friend resulting in that the father makes clear to lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister anne leslie during her up bringing since the family neglected her anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the <UNK> with lionel and therefore she run away from home as this wasn't enough the son greg brian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the marines and is sent to war the storyline in this film can on some occasions feel a bit thin in spite of that it still has a lot of realism in it which makes it well worth seeing since this film illustrates many sensitive relations and situations i would believe that it is best appreciated by a mature audience even though it wouldn't hurt for teenagers to see it and get something to think about before <UNK>
<START> out of the top 24 lesbian films in my library i must rate this one as the number one film of all times this film will go down in history as the best in it's genre it is a story about a girl <UNK> <UNK> who goes from <UNK> to <UNK> and from <UNK> to <UNK> with her first love <UNK> popping in and out of her life it is set against a victorian background in the <UNK> which makes it an ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry this film <UNK> no expense for music and costumes and the make up <UNK> and wore while on stage in the <UNK> only added to the film's diversity br br no matter what kind of films you favor i can guarantee this film will not only <UNK> you but will keep your attention through all three episodes this film will be played and enjoyed for decades to come the <UNK> dvd <UNK> version is a must for anyone's library <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> was the best choice for the casting in these two roles and they played them extremely well
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> was said to have been a favourite of charlie chaplin it presents a <UNK> version of the <UNK> that occurred in <UNK> when the crew of the russian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> against their officers of the regime br br the film is a <UNK> cinema classic and a masterpiece of creative editing especially in the famous <UNK> steps sequence in which innocent civilians are <UNK> down in the bloodshed the happenings of a minute are drawn into five by <UNK> cross cutting the film contains 1 300 separate shots and in 1948 and 1958 was judged the best film ever made by a <UNK> of international critics the <UNK> <UNK> is in the public <UNK> in some parts of the world
<START> nice combination of the giant monster and samurai genres the giant monster <UNK> god of the mountain is an <UNK> and <UNK> figure that comes across very much like the old testament god <UNK> destruction and punishment on those who his holy ground but it's interesting to note that what finally <UNK> him is not the suffering of the people but a pointed and personal insult it's beautifully photographed with solid acting great <UNK> and a wonderful score by the great <UNK> <UNK> is not a 400 foot monster like godzilla he's 2 1 2 times normal size so the evil samurai he <UNK> into the ground get a good look into his <UNK> eyes as he bears down on their <UNK> and <UNK> it to <UNK> not much in terms of extras but it's nice to see this forgotten minor classic rescued and restored to the digital format
<START> the most intense and powerful film i have seen in years there have been other films before that <UNK> into the vietnam vet but nothing compared to this emotionally <UNK> film as a typical american suburban family circa 1972 comes apart at the <UNK> revealing the <UNK> that vietnam has left on our all of our collective souls the cast is a fantastic with all four actors with kathy bates a stand out giving riveting performances what is wonderful about this film is that you take no sides but understand all four characters and empathize with them even though all four have <UNK> <UNK> and needs there are scenes in here that are so powerful as family secrets and feelings are revealed such as the confrontation between son and mother that will have you emotionally <UNK> and in tears of anguish i actually cried in this film something i rarely do the shocking end is a <UNK> a much overlooked film that should be seen i rate this 1996 film a 10 10 a <UNK> piece highly recommended especially in this day and age with again our country <UNK> in a hideous war our <UNK> shouting of atrocities and again our young men and women returning with deep psychological <UNK> with their deep pain of deeds done in the line of honor a must see film
<START> some spoilers <UNK> <UNK> that has j <UNK> <UNK> playing dr <UNK> who's not really dr but an <UNK> who took over his identity back in europe br br the real dr had a affair with dr wife that lead to him to murder the real dr and then having his wife <UNK> infected with that made her look like the elephant man's sister this was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep <UNK> all to himself but the disturbed <UNK> later got even with her insane husband by killing herself br br this nut the fake dr then spots patricia lawrence <UNK> <UNK> one evening at the theater where her father tony ralph morgan a world famous <UNK> is giving a concert enchanted by the lovely patricia who's a dead <UNK> for his dead wife <UNK> dr becomes obsessed with her and goes to extreme <UNK> to marry her even though she's <UNK> nothing to do with him br br after getting <UNK> in his efforts to get patricia to fall in love with him by sending her flowers with <UNK> love notes attached to then as much as five times a day tony goes to see the crazed dr to tell him to stop annoying his daughter it's then that tony ends up getting knocked out by the good doctor who has him <UNK> with a dose of that turns him into a somewhat <UNK> fellow with his hands and body <UNK> up and not being able to play his beloved piano tony is told by his doctor dr adams sam <UNK> that the only one who can cure him of that dreadful disease is non other then dr the person who gave it to him br br the movie has the usual sub plots with dr assistant <UNK> who's also in love with him jealous of the phony doctor making a play for patricia there's also dr <UNK> butler glenn strange who like his pet gorilla is just a big clumsy <UNK> who can't even <UNK> <UNK> who's less the half the size strange ends up getting on the head and knocked out cold by <UNK> boyfriend bobby blake terry frost as for the gorilla he turns out to be but a big hairy <UNK> when he also tries to do in <UNK> and is chased away and locks himself back up in his cage by the pet dog ace dr in his desperation to get patricia to marry him promises her to cure her dad only to have her father break out of his chains and in the ensuing struggle with him ends up shooting dead with his own gun br br there is a happy ending to this whole mess with <UNK> who knew as much about cure for as he did <UNK> tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new the movie ends like it started with tony playing the piano to a packed and cheering house at the local theater
<START> this is a beautiful funny vivid film it's even better than <UNK> cinema <UNK> which it parallels but doesn't <UNK> the story <UNK> a full circle and had the theater <UNK> as the credits rolled a hundred years after this story takes place we're just as intrigued by <UNK> images in a dark theater
<START> i had never heard of the <UNK> until i was really bored one day with some friends in the local blockbuster and it grabbed our attention the description on the dvd jacket grabbed our interest but once we popped it into the dvd player the boredom was only beginning br br the story was dragged out for <UNK> too long it seemed to follow the same outline as other movies which include a kidnapping the most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie however after that the outline was followed exactly and that made the <UNK> unoriginal the flashbacks were too many in number and the grief of the <UNK> family provided nothing interesting nor enhanced the nature of the film and i also found that i did not like the ending so that probably led to me not liking the movie at all br br the acting was not horrible it wasn't the greatest though robert redford has given much better performances willem <UNK> tragic character was the only one i really saw develop throughout the story line and the viewer only really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie helen <UNK> portrayal as robert <UNK> wife was flat and sort of followed the same generic mold as other movies which include a tragic and heart splitting event br br in my opinion the <UNK> is nothing to rave about use your movie rental money on something else like garden state perhaps
<START> <UNK> bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports br br its has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just don't work actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice i'd watch again rather than watch this film again
<START> this is the very first three stooges short with <UNK> that i saw and it is one of my favorites br br that is what i really liked about <UNK> when he returned after <UNK> stroke he did not try to be like curly he was his own character and that is what i admire <UNK> is my favorite third <UNK> i like him more than curly but i like curly as much as i do <UNK> <UNK> is great he's funny he's silly he's <UNK> br br i really loved the scene where he dropped the <UNK> and moe got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting <UNK> in the <UNK> and really badly hurt br br but what i really thought was scary was when <UNK> had his face <UNK> against the glass of the <UNK> he looked like a <UNK> professor br br poor <UNK> he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short but that is just typical three stooges they always have a lot of bad things happening to them br br this short is another must see for three stooges fans br br 10 10
<START> believe me i wanted this series to work but the early departure of kevin <UNK> dealt a near death blow after season one robert just wasn't right for the part and jane did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point i don't know what happened in season five what a mess sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull if you know what i mean the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of <UNK> parker and anita as the two in quiet conflict if not for their talents and well written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man chicks in a b movie series br br if only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by <UNK>
<START> i was surprised as i watched this movie how much it had me no the actors didn't act like typical <UNK> actors but that's not always bad either as this film proves quite different from the disney standard it is a refreshing turn none the less they also give you a taste of what it was probably like without being a movie everyone should both see and enjoy many people love arguing over in any movie of this type but just getting the basic idea has plenty to offer mild <UNK> east and west germany viewed on any map would have west germany on the left side east to the right the movie at times sets you back slightly because about half of the scenes have west germany on the right side of the screen and other times on the left side even during the same events they shift back and forth perhaps just a little more <UNK> would have avoided this mild distraction go see it
<START> ok i am a huge <UNK> fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 8 5 rating but even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an hbo movie but i am afraid if you take <UNK> out of the movie it would just be ok but a person can't do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress she just keeps getting better and better
<START> im sorry to myself you know why i feel <UNK> from the viewing of this movie i went to the theater with some friends to see this movie and still did not give it the satisfaction of watching it in entirety i left with about 20 minutes left hoping to god it might make me at least comfortable for a moment most movies now even this bad ones when i watch them there may be a small part in the movie where i feel some joy at times because of maybe a quirky joke or a good line this movie on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable and mad at myself the whole time especially since i wasted money on it it was poorly written poorly directed poorly shot and definitely poorly acted br br please for the good of humanity do not see this movie even if your some guy who wants to say he has seen like every movie ever just don't
<START> any evening with jonathan ross now means to me his wit in first <UNK> and <UNK> with carefully chosen words a <UNK> year old man by phone and then suggesting he and russell brand should house break and <UNK> him while he slept as a way to say sorry for making obscene phone calls to him kinky and illegal for a really big laugh maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well like his boss or a <UNK> of abu would he be amused if someone did it to one of his daughters br br over all the years i've perhaps seen less than 30 minutes of bbc star man <UNK> chat show because i find him so <UNK> some of the guests i saw were ok though probably most of them who ever appeared were ok for all i know as a chat show it seems pretty poor though  what's so <UNK> about asking <UNK> leader david cameron on this tv programme whether he ever <UNK> to photographs of margaret <UNK> he up gwyneth paltrow by simply asking her if she wanted to f him however <UNK> mentality was finally totally exposed with the above revelations and i thought i'd take the opportunity to warn the few decent folk around the world who might not know just how vile this man is and to steer clear of him and his unless you think all comedy should be edgy ie obscene vacuous we're not yet all the same here although bbc and channel 4 are <UNK> all standards br br in october 2008 ross with fellow russell brand made a series of <UNK> sexual obscene phone calls to andrew <UNK> answer phone <UNK> from <UNK> towers had it broadcast as intended on bbc national radio against <UNK> request and then tried to get <UNK> <UNK> to burn the evidence in case they got <UNK> a significant number of people over here probably most of them non bbc license <UNK> <UNK> found it hilarious and or that the national scandal had been overblown but many people apparently still knew right from wrong and <UNK> eventually complained to bbc about the incident many media fools and others <UNK> about these <UNK> never having heard the radio programme and never wanting to using their argument they presumably also consider an event such as the holocaust justified because at the time relatively few people complained to the media and none of us here now should be horrified by it because we weren't there the 2 bbc producers initially involved in passing it for broadcast thought it was very funny and brilliant comedy and only 2 people complained about <UNK> radio programme at the time which i'm afraid only <UNK> the moral level his 400 000 weekly <UNK> had sunk to with the help of bbc expertise highly moral bbc tried and failed to use it in in the later investigation roll over <UNK> tell lord the news <UNK> agent complained to bbc but was ignored by them until a <UNK> national newspaper got hold of the story the penalty for any ordinary <UNK> doing this would normally be <UNK> and <UNK> maybe even prison but while brand and the head of bbc radio 2 were both eventually ordered to <UNK> the multi millionaire ross was given a 12 week holiday by <UNK> boss i suppose that he asked <UNK> <UNK> first though if he could <UNK> <UNK> pay by <UNK> 500 000 to prevent him from <UNK> to come back to this programme <UNK> in 2009 before his contract runs out all that time to think of more <UNK> and or more insulting for his 4 000 000 viewers to admire but at least he could still <UNK> his way to the bank as usual to keep his spirits up some people think that his position will be <UNK> and he won't be able to carry on i think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that he will come back <UNK> and re <UNK> with <UNK> up <UNK> update 23 <UNK> <UNK> i've just watched the first 5 minutes of his new series the most enormous <UNK> up to use his <UNK> phrase is continuing to allow this <UNK> <UNK> law <UNK> to take the <UNK> money like this but who knows maybe in the future after the slimy british film tv <UNK> have <UNK> him for the moral stance taken by the <UNK> and <UNK> him with awards he will become a sir for his services to <UNK> by the <UNK> in government at the least i hope this pair of edgy <UNK> sign up with other perverted commercial tv and radio stations and stay there so i won't be paying for their the law and <UNK> illegal <UNK> in the future in 2009 <UNK> british tv license <UNK> <UNK> 000 for this sorry affair thanks ross for offering to pay not br br to the <UNK> get a life sense of humour sense of <UNK> it's not the end of the world having a pair of talentless <UNK> as your heroes and there's far more important things to worry about in this world like the price of real cheese to sum up family man <UNK> a comedy genius to apparently millions of people especially himself merely a nasty obscene phone <UNK> receiving an obscene <UNK> <UNK> from an obscene <UNK> company to others so much for our society of political correctness and respect as you should've guessed it doesn't apply to the rich and famous and never will but only to the poor to sum up bbc stumbling <UNK> on from now i hope its next crisis will be i also hope anyone who thinks comedy should be always challenging and pushing back boundaries ie offensive aren't challenged or offended by my opinion of this particular law breaking <UNK> his perverted <UNK> and his current perverted <UNK>
<START> i found this movie on one of my old videos after godzilla vs the sea monster which should instantly give you an idea of it's tone and i hadn't seen it in a while so i decided to watch it i didn't remember much about <UNK> except i used to like the cartoon and that it was cute most people feel that way about her you probably do to br br well when the movie started i wondered if it was the right one it didn't fit the mold of <UNK> as i remembered her but it turns out she kicks butt this has to be the strangest animated movie ever i can't believe these characters were so popular the series isn't much different while being so <UNK> as soon as i watched this movie again it became one of my favorites br br i really don't want to give too much away just know that if you see the movie in the video store rent it and watch it no questions asked you will get a kick out of it especially the outrageous princess character and the robotic horse and the <UNK> <UNK> br br if you can't tell by know this is an 80's cartoon that is really an <UNK> head movie in disguise have fun
<START> i am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case i'll make an exception the first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and <UNK> of the movie it sucks this is one movie were i <UNK> for the bad guys because the captain save the day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him the lead actor gave the weakest performance and laurence fishburne or matt dillon couldn't even save this movie sometime there are eye <UNK> or great moments in a film that may not be that great this movie has none if you are looking for a movie to see in the meantime while nothing <UNK> your interest don't choose this one save your money
<START> joe is one of those movies where although you think that it might go along smoothly ends up hitting you like i can't come up with an <UNK> it showed not only that america's long standing idea of <UNK> was <UNK> but also the various aspects within our society melissa <UNK> susan sarandon is the ultimate flower child while her father bill dennis patrick is a clean cut executive one day bill accidentally kills <UNK> boyfriend in the immediate aftermath bill gets <UNK> with joe peter boyle an ultra right wing <UNK> racist working stiff as a result the two of them end up <UNK> more and more with the hippies whom bill finds unpleasant and joe outright hates but in the end everything has dead serious consequences br br true some parts of the movie are a little bit dated but it's a good <UNK> of america's two sides during the vietnam war and rest assured the <UNK> effects of all that will probably never go away
<START> bloody awful there's just no other way to put it in fact it's so bad that the only reason i'm wasting words on this is to warn off other reasonable viewers who want to be intelligently entertained you'll lose i q points watching this come to think of it it's not even suitable for mindless viewing because of the <UNK> factor there's no guilty pleasure in watching something this incompetent br br reasons to avoid it br br 1 horribly <UNK> inaccurate to the point where this isn't sci fi anymore it's just sloppy lazy fantasy br br 2 it sports fx that are cheesy beyond belief not even cheesy <UNK> that's a <UNK> and a nod like vintage doctor who but just cheap and shoddy to the point of being insulting the fx are so bad they're not even laughable they spent about a dollar fifty on this not more br br 3 the direction is so weak and mindless that the only way the actors could make it through to the end of shooting without becoming <UNK> depressed was to <UNK> through their roles although catherine <UNK> made some effort anyway probably on principle and despite the director moreover this isn't peter only bad film his <UNK> vastly <UNK> any barely <UNK> ones of which <UNK> was the last such and that was 15 years before this writing he's had nothing halfway decent since end of days was just as <UNK> arnold was the only draw and he needed much <UNK> direction than provided just keeps making it more and more pointless for anyone to consider giving him more work br br and finally br br 4 ray <UNK> stories deserve far better treatment than this <UNK> to watch this film sends that message not that hollywood is particularly listening br br watch at your own risk if you do and it turns you off movies altogether you've only yourself and to blame because you've been more than adequately warned
<START> on the opening night of the san francisco silent film festival i was quite excited to see films that are historical and well not common the guest <UNK> who opened this film created a sense of hype towards the obscurity and how this film is underrated the sci fi part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time but i'm not sure if it was due to the fact it was shown directly after the brilliant <UNK> the wind or if it seemed that russian filmmakers take after what russian novels are famous for hundreds of characters <UNK> plots but i know for certain that the dramatic parts as in the parts on earth made absolutely no sense were boring and i became lost within about twenty minutes maybe it was the acting but i found myself convinced as to why this film is unknown and underrated it's boring there is no plot or basic story and the acting is horrible this certainly is no <UNK> <UNK> however i will say that russian films do not make a real good effort in lightning up what life in russia is like
<START> half empty is a hilarious musical about the eternal <UNK> this case a self help book writer who goes to germany <UNK> thinking he's popular there instead of an <UNK> audience he finds himself <UNK> in a world of jaded <UNK> including the woman who is supposed to be his <UNK> his attempts to make scenes that are largely to one great encounter after another when he is <UNK> abused by <UNK> musicians gruff gangsters etc in time he manages to win over his her heart and her mind but his own world view is <UNK> when his hero a much more popular self help writer turns out to be not quite what he seems the action is <UNK> by several musical numbers br br we saw this at the film festival in <UNK> city and were blown away this is a really funny inspired small scale indie production you could <UNK> about a few technical things like the lighting which is a bit dark but the piece is funny and inspired enough that you can't care too much if <UNK> were writing <UNK> today the character would be a self help writer
<START> the duo of <UNK> and <UNK> lives on in this version of a story time classic in jack and the there's everything to see music magic and comedy rolled into one <UNK> play plays jack after he <UNK> to the story being told by a young boy one time we know jack was a poor boy who sells his cow <UNK> for 5 magic <UNK> well he plants those 5 <UNK> and they were indeed magic he climbs to the sky sees a big castle there and he would sing a song unknown he would encounter the giant buddy <UNK> not only him he would dance with the woman who was also a giant she would <UNK> jack with her <UNK> during the dance that was funny you got the playing <UNK> who knows how to put the giant as ease the <UNK> who lays golden eggs and my favorite the way jack gets rid of the giant he gets the <UNK> and started <UNK> down on the another funny is where the <UNK> got stuck during the chop and the final celebration happens when the people dance around the <UNK> where the giant fell a lot of fun and fun for the whole family as well very recommended 5 stars
<START> wicked little things known in australia as zombies is a rare find  a film that promises one thing but delivers another it is one of the few genre films to be made by millennium pictures a european film studio known for making various b grade action films thrillers some featuring action star jean claude van damme br br karen her two daughters sarah emma arrive in the town of in order to move into a large house that <UNK> late husband owned after finding a <UNK> deed in his effects once arriving they find that the house is very old in need of <UNK> but the <UNK> condition is the least of their problems as they discover that the area is prone to <UNK> karen is confronted by the owner ordered to move out once night falls the find out the reason behind the <UNK> a group of zombie children killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago come out to kill anything that goes in the woods with the help of a <UNK> <UNK> karen attempts to end the curse before her her children become the next victims br br i bought the dvd expecting a film with flesh eating zombies but was let down by one thing the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick with the dead children being the <UNK> of a curse that <UNK> the woods taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night although the internal logic is somewhat flawed  the children can only be <UNK> by the sacrifice of animals are <UNK> by blood <UNK> on doors in the same manner that vampires are <UNK> by <UNK> mirrors  aren't these kids supposed to be zombies the plot as such would not be a problem would actually be entertaining but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film only to fall flat on their faces with this effort br br as such a film like this would be okay as a ghost story but due to a poor script becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort the film's greatest strength is the acting with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves of particular note is <UNK> taylor <UNK> who does her role quite well  it's a shame she ruins her genre <UNK> with a very poor performance in the halloween remake or maybe it's just rob <UNK> script
<START> this version of david <UNK> is dreadful from start to finish i knew we were in for a wasted <UNK> viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment attenborough and olivier camp it up as two baddies it was all downhill after this aunt <UNK> was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for the worst of the worst was the <UNK> choice for <UNK> this was the music hall version of this character previously and admirably played by <UNK> young and what was all this self absorbed angst from david dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a <UNK> <UNK> in his beer br br this was one time when hollywood knew more than jolly old england
<START> well the episode i just watched had the older girl whining about why people keep mentioning her husband mr a famous american football player apparently she seems unwilling to accept that he's the only reason she isn't flipping <UNK> she married someone famous and that's why she has cameras pointed at her br br when challenged by an <UNK> to explain what she actually does she gave a wonderfully <UNK> reason for why people should pay attention to her i work really hard on my reality tv show then she said i'm not a celebrity i'm a personality br br i'm not quite sure who this series is meant to appeal to except people who've had all their intelligence removed it's certainly no role model to anyone except gold <UNK> as the two stars do nothing but spend money and all it tells you about rich people is that they have no money problems
<START> there's nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me i'm not racist against <UNK> hell i'm half brazilian i loved the movie kids it doesn't make any sense these kids just go around and do nothing they're not even good at <UNK> the whole time i'm just waiting for something anything to happen but it doesn't nothing happens the whole movie did i mention they suck at <UNK> i might make a movie called beat up <UNK> and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh t out of <UNK> moron <UNK> like these kids i'm not even going to get into it this movie sucks please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake
<START> where to start where to start hmmm well how about some of the <UNK> most unnatural unbelievable and <UNK> up performances one can imagine how about stereotypical characters situations and locations or what about a manipulative <UNK> utterly wretched script i can't think of one element in this movie that was original worthy of watching or interesting br br note to all you josh <UNK> chris <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fans enjoy their collective fifteen minutes folks because they're not going to be famous much longer
<START> i first saw the couch trip 1988 on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it the funny thing is i usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until i saw it dan <UNK> is plain and <UNK> <UNK> period he has made a couple great movies with belushi and don't forget saturday night live but i think the couch trip is probably his best and funniest with a good supporting cast of charles <UNK> david and walter matthau this piece of cinema shines with comic gold <UNK> wife donna even does a fine job here my favorite moments of the film involve <UNK> and david <UNK> lawrence those two played well off each other so if you haven't seen a good comedy in take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy the couch trip i just did amazon <UNK> cents what a bargain too bad i got hit with a 2 50 <UNK> <UNK> oh well still well worth it any guy will love this flick check it out
<START> christopher <UNK> attracted me to this movie what a waste the plot has more holes than my string <UNK> the special effects were not very good it did not take much to figure out who the <UNK> mother was and the creature <UNK> more than a little debt to predator anti this movie could have been done a whole lot better it does raise one interesting point however when is hollywood going to discover the rich vein of european <UNK> out there just waiting to be <UNK>
<START> a group of teens that have broken into a huge department store are attacked by a crazed police man exciting and suspenseful throughout and <UNK> devoid of extreme violence and gore but those aussie <UNK> and accents are a bit much to take and they can <UNK> <UNK> but this is still a good thriller 7 out of 10
<START> not only why but what were they thinking this must have been some br br sort of <UNK> to gus van <UNK> because this is one of those odd movies br br that never should have been re made it <UNK> to be <UNK> film br br frame by frame but without the magic or the tension or the great film br br making rent the original instead spare yourself
<START> the <UNK> and the snowman is based on a true story christopher <UNK> and andrew lee the titular <UNK> played by timothy <UNK> and sean penn received their code names from the <UNK> why <UNK> was an avid and lee was a coke head the movie is based on a true story it's based on the book of the same name another reviewer asked what was their motivation <UNK> it ain't ideology it ain't <UNK> my bad <UNK> but i'm making a point here what was it if it wasn't <UNK> or ideology in a word greed by the time of the <UNK> lee case money became the great <UNK> and not ideology don't believe me then look at the walker family spy ring which was broken in the late '80s three spies did the worst damage to our national security in the '70s and '80s john walker who began his career as a spy in the '60s christopher <UNK> and andrew lee all three sold out this country for thirty pieces of silver if you aren't familiar with that phrase i suggest you read the bible
<START> i don't believe i've seen a horror movie this bad since hell i don't believe i've ever seen a horror movie this bad the acting alone was enough to make one cringe the bad acting went way beyond horror film cheesy it was just plain awful and did you check out those god awful special effects when the demon which looked more like a cheaply constructed puppet came out of the wall i couldn't tell if i was supposed to be frightened or laughing my ass off as a huge fan of the horror genre this film was more than mildly disappointing i couldn't help but notice the director is from <UNK> or which just happens to be my own hometown i must say i'm deeply ashamed if i could i'd give this film a negative 500
<START> i had been interested in this film for a long time especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the dvd edition however i kept its purchase because of the excessive price tag and utter lack of relevant <UNK> when it went out of print earlier this year i finally gave in but the entire order which included a number of other highly <UNK> titles got lost in <UNK> luckily the dvd has been re <UNK> at bargain price and i'm sure glad i picked it up br br anyway this is one strange film and a genuine sleeper initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit <UNK> with respect to both its <UNK> small town atmosphere and the inherent <UNK> of the sinister goings on a small cast responds perfectly to a <UNK> absorbing and intelligent script lead martin in particular makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctor head of the <UNK> <UNK> l q jones and moore both of whom also produced the film offer solid support as the no nonsense sheriff and his comic strip <UNK> assistant br br the plot <UNK> elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural and not only the obvious titles the fact that the town is held under a spell which can't at first be identified for instance brings instantly to mind the similar <UNK> of one specific <UNK> household in luis <UNK> <UNK> surreal the <UNK> angel <UNK> the <UNK> angle was borrowed perhaps from village of the damned 1960 there have been many films especially of a recent vintage where the satanic <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> are shown from the city of the dead 1960 to the devil rides out 1968 but since the proceedings take place in modern day america albeit in remote surroundings and <UNK> around elderly witches seeking a <UNK> the film they recall most of all is rosemary's baby 1968 br br the occult scenes <UNK> as much by <UNK> <UNK> as by the shadowy lighting of the <UNK> <UNK> house where the diabolical events take place are presented in a completely matter of fact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank <UNK> a car the rampage of a devil doll a concept which has been done to death over the years but here it raises an <UNK> <UNK> a surreal dream sequence set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept since they can't be buried a sequence where the witches attack a <UNK> member of the <UNK> a <UNK> committed by a horse riding medieval knight and the lengthy <UNK> finale with the witches accompanied by the respective child they will be <UNK> <UNK> all dressed in red except for a black clad martin <UNK> over the ceremony which <UNK> in ritual mass suicide br br the film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat <UNK> it's so refreshing to come across a title albeit a low budget production from a major hollywood studio columbia that <UNK> to go so completely against the grain like i said the film is quite weird <UNK> also to the editing and the score it's odd too that such a classy and cinematic horror offering <UNK> should come from a tv director most often associated with westerns and other family fare by the way the same theme was dealt with almost in the <UNK> christopher lee peter cushing collaboration nothing but the night 1972 which lee produced himself a film i <UNK> missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local tv and which has been m i a ever since br br p s this review of the <UNK> of satan will certainly contain spoilers but then the synopsis and artwork featured on the dvd cover manage to give everything away anyway
<START> i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films for me usually involve jane seymour or <UNK> smith as the mother of a sick child who is dying of a difficult to treat disease all done in such a <UNK> manner that the audience <UNK> t need <UNK> it needs so when deadly voyage a made for tv film by the bbc and hbo based on a true story i vaguely remembered from a couple of years previously turned up on the tv <UNK> i sat down waiting to be bored senseless i was surprised br br no strike that last sentence i <UNK> t surprised i was shocked here is a <UNK> that grips you <UNK> than a great white shark in fact deadly voyage <UNK> t deserve to be <UNK> to the tv <UNK> it should have been made and distributed by a top hollywood film company due its absolutely terrifying premise and what s more it s unlike <UNK> and <UNK> completely true br br for those who don t know the story possible spoilers as to plot sometime in the early 90s a bunch of <UNK> away on an <UNK> <UNK> ship bound for france in order to work there of course it was an attempt at illegal <UNK> but the crew of the <UNK> had already been <UNK> for allowing illegal immigrants onto their ship from a previous journey and not wanting to get into anymore trouble with <UNK> and <UNK> authorities the crew murder the <UNK> after discovering them hiding in the hold all except one african kingsley who manages to escape from the firing squad but who must try and survive aboard the ship but the problem is the crew are hunting him and france is still several days voyage away br br just <UNK> the above paragraph reminds of how good deadly voyage is what a remarkable story and once again it is unlike many stories that claim to be totally true it s very well written directed and acted especially by sean pertwee why <UNK> t that guy a big name star and most of all it s a tense claustrophobic disturbing thriller that i can still remember vividly six years after seeing it for the one and only time i look forward to seeing again br br but you <UNK> got to ask yourself how can a <UNK> be better than most of the hollywood action blockbusters that came out round about the same time oh hold on i <UNK> just had a disturbing thought about jerry doing a remake with tony scott directing and with <UNK> washington playing kingsley brad pitt playing pertwee s role massive artistic <UNK> taken with events etc let s keep deadly voyage a <UNK> <UNK> rather than a poor blockbuster
<START> too <UNK> to be enjoyable too loose to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be tolerable mr lonely is an interesting idea ruined by really bad film making like a ken russell film at its worst or day of the <UNK> remade by amateurs mr lonely might have seemed like a good idea on a few <UNK> of paper no script you see and a free holiday to somewhere but in the end we have a widescreen film that seems as if it was made by film students whose parents told them that everything they did was a brilliant creation or did i get the film maker right mr lonely is a waste of resources trying to be <UNK> quirky and deliberately off <UNK> it ends up being annoying and indulgent and pointless what's the point of going to a <UNK> in scotland what a stupid idea in this film about hollywood <UNK> maybe wanted to remake <UNK> well the result is god awful oh and there is some subplot like <UNK> footage from including <UNK> <UNK> nuns and a plane add <UNK> mo <UNK> and <UNK> music all <UNK> and melancholy add james fox who seems to hope he might be seen as daring like in performance and the result is <UNK> fantasy <UNK> soup in widescreen it might have been fun to film but the result on the screen is a mess imagine american pie band camp with food <UNK>
<START> kidman and law lack the chemistry to make this <UNK> directed poorly written romance melodrama work on any level other than kidman <UNK> and br br <UNK> <UNK> for her absent lover law she's just met him when he's <UNK> off to do battle for the south in the civil war and they've only <UNK> about 5 sentences and one kiss yet they're totally smitten <UNK> main direction throughout seems to be look <UNK> and shell shocked but sensitive ' <UNK> <UNK> is about the only spark in this dreary script but she plays it way too broad and over the top like she was starring in annie get your gun ' <UNK> <UNK> boy <UNK> something about her character felt more like it <UNK> in a monty python sketch the one from holy <UNK> where the <UNK> spend all their time <UNK> in <UNK> making mud <UNK> for no reason kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a victorian era novel br br whenever the action <UNK> down into total tedium which is frequently all the writers do is shout cue the simon type villain ' and ray <UNK> comes <UNK> out of nowhere to do his <UNK> <UNK> acts like kill and torture innocent god <UNK> <UNK> in the name of loyalty to a fast <UNK> br br <UNK> all other times he's missing in action which is preposterous even in this <UNK> script there is a <UNK> of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles these are the characters law meets as he does his johnny trek from the front lines where he has deserted to the hopefully loving embrace of kidman back in cold mountain ultimately though none of these characters matter law has no time for them or their lives each of these little mini movies has the same tired theme war is <UNK> <UNK> heck and turns otherwise decent christian folk into <UNK> animals br br and the script is far too predictable too heavy handed moreover the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow you spend the entire movie waiting for romeo and inevitable reunion with kidman <UNK> her hands and <UNK> law <UNK> incredible odds and <UNK> bullets and when it finally comes you just don't care anymore you'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this <UNK> you have to endure br br i give it one star out of five for the battle scenes there is a potent anti war message here the incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the <UNK> on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff but it's only about 15 minutes of this 150 minute dog
<START> what can you expect from a direct to dvd film you know what you are getting yourself into when you rent this the quality of the cinematography reminds me of reality tv shows br br why are they shots always up so close to the actors and why are they always centered there isn't anything to look at and the actors are that great looking so that blows br br the writing and dialogue is just plain awful that intro scene with the british guy is hilarious just try and listen this words they hardly make any sense just goes around in circles the lines in the rest of the movie sounds like they were pull out of romance and sci fi novels as if the writers had no idea what they were doing the characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they're saying br br this is a terrible movie i feel bad for the actors tied to this project embarrassing
<START> this seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing it may be of interest to those who know something about <UNK> during the world war ii era but i recommend that all others beware many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak the story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough but there's no real pacing or tension in the story i also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying partially due to some strong english accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording i give this a <UNK> 100 most folks will want to steer clear
<START> i can't believe how bad this film is for starters the movie deals with the legend of big foot and a group of people having a close encounter with the creature the premise is interesting and having lance <UNK> in the cast aliens gave the <UNK> a promising <UNK> unfortunately that's as interesting as it gets this looks like a direct to dvd release or so i guess this is basically a production less affair with probably the worst editing with a constant <UNK> to black in between every scene i've seen in my life and acting that will sure make you cringe why lance <UNK> picked this is completely and the movie takes <UNK> from just about any other genre movie from blair witch project the video scene and predator to alive this is supposedly based on true events but the only truth to be found <UNK> is just how bad this movie is i'm usually not a harsh critic and believe me i did try to enjoy this trash but eventually did not do yourselves a favor and steer clear from this dvd br br i'll try to put it mildly this movie is pure garbage and it made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors or ask blockbuster for a <UNK> br br and lance shame on you 1 out of 10
<START> mild spoilers br br with the exception of the terminator and total recall i don t think arnie s action adventure movies are up to much they re better than his comedies for sure but that s hardly saying much the problem i have with his all action blockbusters is that they re overblown and lacking in any sort of morality br br morality i mentioned in my review of terminator 2 the scene where good guy terminator blows the <UNK> off the <UNK> team are we to think that because the hero <UNK> people doing their job instead of killing them we will admire him in <UNK> this is the problem with <UNK> when james <UNK> s character is revealed as a <UNK> within the us <UNK> department arnie s character john <UNK> goes on the run with a witness he s protecting but in several later sequences <UNK> kills a fairly large amount of working with the villain are we take it they were all <UNK> too surely many of them were honest men who were trying to stop <UNK> because the bad guy told them <UNK> was the <UNK> it s a rather uneasy thought that <UNK> killed several people who were trying to genuinely up hold the law br br despite <UNK> one hundred million dollars the special effects t all that impressive look at the scene where <UNK> lets go of the jet wing and <UNK> to put on a <UNK> it s obvious as the action <UNK> that it s a <UNK> who s doing the free fall sequence while arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen <UNK> is also a film that has unnecessary cgi featuring killer <UNK> not only unnecessary cgi but unconvincing cgi too there s also a few plot holes like in the opening scene involving a couple of witness protection people that the mob has caught up with <UNK> opens a car <UNK> and pulls out a couple of bodies and starts a fire thereby throwing the mob of the <UNK> <UNK> is next seen <UNK> the dental records via computer of the couple he s saved it would be logical to do this but would all the couples dental records be kept on computer most importantly of all are we to believe the us <UNK> department keep a <UNK> full of bodies for such events br br so they re you go a typical arnie thriller long on unlikely set pieces and short on intelligence and it s interesting to note that <UNK> <UNK> t make much of a profit at the box office as the production costs almost <UNK> a potential audience figure after <UNK> arnie <UNK> t do much more business at the box office save for terminator 3 rise of the machines which was an event movie and it ll be interesting to see if he ll be remembered as a politician rather than a movie star
<START> 1989 was already a year in where eddie murphy wasn't that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten <UNK> enough it was also the year in where murphy directed his first film but it also would be the first and last experiment harlem nights wasn't exactly what you can call a success even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together namely murphy and richard <UNK> don't blame it on the actors as they all played their roles like you expected them do even if you have to face again the typical murphy laugh the worst thing from harlem nights are both the scenario and its terrible <UNK> everything is set in the roaring <UNK> and everybody has their profit from the forbidden <UNK> sugar ray <UNK> and his adopted son <UNK> murphy are gathering easily dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie sugar and <UNK> aren't guys who give their money for free and have their own plans you can watch harlem nights that's for sure but if you <UNK> from the moment you hear the name murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes
<START> this is by far my favorite action movie but what makes it work is not the elaborate <UNK> <UNK> explosions and shoot em ups it's the <UNK> black script and its <UNK> delivery by <UNK> davis and samuel l jackson br br the chemistry between the two principals <UNK> a sequel thank god it was never made too much danger of <UNK> the original br br 'the long from <UNK> scene to action scene to <UNK> scene and back again never a dull moment br br this has to be jackson's funniest role ever and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career no quirky tarantino hit man super cool <UNK> or borderline psycho soldier in jackson is the <UNK> we identify with the poor <UNK> gets dragged along on this crazy woman's odyssey to <UNK> the dangerous secret of her past br br though the story claims that <UNK> character samantha caine is suffering from <UNK> the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder br br samantha caine is not just a new identity taken by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she is a separate fully developed personality the <UNK> suffered by samantha in the first half hour of the movie help the <UNK> <UNK> personality of <UNK> to emerge again br br the <UNK> of her past life <UNK> by jackson's detective mitch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> good timing too considering the target samantha makes of herself br br but <UNK> has to fight herself to remain the <UNK> personality one <UNK> from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality <UNK> developed after her father died and she was <UNK> by the chapter br br in the eight years <UNK> was buried in the psyche though her samantha identity developed into the <UNK> personality she's even funnier that <UNK> this was probably due to becoming a mother because it's the reunion with her daughter that breaks <UNK> struggle to <UNK> samantha leading to their apparent <UNK> by movie's end br br it's impossible to choose a best quote from this film br br now you're a <UNK> br br i saved your ass it was great br br continue dying out br br i <UNK> 'em in the jaw and yell goes the br br and a couple of dozen more many too raunchy to quote here br br <UNK> davis looks great and comes off as an action hero without <UNK> over the fact she's turning forty listen to history do the <UNK> br br fantastic soundtrack too <UNK> <UNK> waters elvis marvin <UNK> br br i give 'the long kiss a 9 only because i don't believe in a perfect 10 seen it a dozen times and it still stays fresh nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to <UNK> a wonderful life '
<START> boring as hell and kind of a chick flick br br it's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business <UNK> the romantic nature of a one night stand and the <UNK> and <UNK> of true love br br many of the story's <UNK> are reminiscent of other recent movies e g the english patient but have far less appeal br br after the first half hour i started checking my watch wondering if i'd make it home in time to catch leno on tv br br i passed up gladiator to see this
<START> this is one of the best of the early star trek episodes with kirk and his crew <UNK> into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name imagine their surprise when they find out that the <UNK> <UNK> are racial <UNK> of the <UNK> young mr stiles well played by paul is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the star trek universe his barely disguised hatred of mr spock is <UNK> similar to the post 9 11 hatred and suspicion many americans have of people of arab or middle eastern origin the atmosphere of war time paranoia is all too real then there's the <UNK> they're the ultimate <UNK> nemesis the <UNK> are nasty but basically harmless more of a <UNK> than a serious threat the <UNK> however mean business they're the ancient <UNK> <UNK> in the space age in spite of their features they're clearly meant to remind us of <UNK> rome with names like and titles like and the chain mail armor is really cool familiar guest star mark who went on to play <UNK> dad as well as the <UNK> commander in star trek the motion picture is an appropriately <UNK> war weary commander a character who bears a striking resemblance to laurence <UNK> in <UNK> also his questioning of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for conquest reminds me of the similar <UNK> marcus <UNK> richard harris expressed at the beginning of gladiator a must both for <UNK> and sword and <UNK> epic fans
<START> i remember seeing this film in the mid 80's thought it a well paced and well acted piece i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed although my office is it just 30 seconds away from the bank even jack car <UNK> is still there selling and rolls br br it's look like the dvd is due a region 2 release soon the region 1 copy i is very poor quality let's hope they've <UNK> it up br br only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court <UNK> what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with
<START> went to the preview engagement of grand champion today dallas <UNK> worth austin <UNK> and a couple of other texas cities there are so few movies suitable for young children but this one is and it's great though the plot is a little hokey also the name of the steer in the movie it is a wonderful story for children and i enjoyed it too br br the film pretty well represents west texas ranch family life although a little exaggerated director author barry ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment he called the film his love letter to texas br br joey lauren adams plays the single mom of buddy <UNK> fisher and sister emma roberts watch emma roberts julia <UNK> niece she's very good and i think she will be in more films there are also cameo appearances from julia roberts bruce willis musicians george <UNK> charlie robert earl keen joe <UNK> and <UNK> legends larry and <UNK> br br if you have young children or just want to see a feel good movie check out grand champion when it comes to your city supposedly later this month <UNK> will enjoy it and it will make you feel good br br i guess since i'm from west texas i might be a little biased <UNK> i'm <UNK> the film is excellent
<START> i watched this series on tv in 1990 and absolutely loved it i was nine years old i bought the first dvd box about six month ago and got the second a couple of days ago thanks to my dear husband gosh it was hard to get any sleep with all the thoughts in my head what was gonna happen to <UNK> and george etc slave issues and civil war has always fascinated me a 25 year old <UNK> i advise to read slaves in the family by edward ball for those who want to take a <UNK> in the past and try to understand what really happened br br i'm not sure if i want to see heaven and hell after so many people have told here that it wasn't really that good
<START> the other reviewer was completely correct about this one the writing was awful the acting was awful the subject was awful the actors looked like they were not really into the movie like they almost had to be there there were some unique camera effects but they were not really <UNK> to the story or what there was of a story and they weren't produced particularly well br br i suppose they were trying to on the success can i say that of the other influenced movies <UNK> code left behind and yes it does make christians embarrassed when these types of movies are produced i would not recommend this movie to anyone especially a non christian
<START> a couple of men are ship <UNK> on a remote island they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants while in the castle <UNK> lives the <UNK> unfortunate <UNK> wife br br the <UNK> of <UNK> is pretty much a hack job of a movie the amateur actors all <UNK> through the film while an annoyingly <UNK> score continually plays in the background the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly <UNK> way in fact the film in general is completely <UNK> it just seems to drag on and on and even though the ending isn't too bad you will be hard pressed to care by that point as an example of 60's gothic horror this is strictly a bargain basement example i sadly can't recommend this one really
<START> the funniest performance was by <UNK> harlow as matt <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend she was more interesting to me than all the lead actors this movie got it all wrong even the most <UNK> actress of the century joan was not able to rise about the <UNK> of the plot i did enjoy hearing macho man by the village people over the closing credits the rest of the movie might have been tolerable if it were to rise to that level of energy
<START> slow moving but smart passes you by as if you lived it filled with thought provoking ideas art race and being cool that one thing hit me hard was the ideas about the rock <UNK> roll <UNK> br br all the performances were improvised i will say it again all the performances were improvised sounds like a gimmick but its not it makes these characters real and like some one you would hang with this also an amazing thing when you think about how strong the character are in this film right from the beginning in the title sequence it immediately establish ben as an <UNK> by the way he moves though the crowd br br okay it breaks down like this if your a person who lives the jazz rocker lifestyle of cool you will like it if your smart and understand great cinema from total crap you will love it and if your both then it might be you <UNK> br br but if your none of these then you will probably think its boring and say it doesn't follow one line and write a crap review like ben <UNK>
<START> it's true that they died with their boots on gives a highly <UNK> account of george armstrong <UNK> errol flynn life and career but a remarkable one especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the us american <UNK> and native american leader chief crazy horse anthony quinn in a <UNK> light i'm almost tempted to say that little big man in its <UNK> anti <UNK> stance seems <UNK> by comparison further one should not be <UNK> by the title of the picture  this isn't just a movie about the battle of the little big horn it's a movie about that shows the <UNK> west point <UNK> the famed civil war hero the indian fighter and last but not least the husband br br the movie begins with <UNK> time at the west point military academy where his and <UNK> behavior lead to frequent during a military exercise he meets his future wife elizabeth bacon olivia de <UNK> who like <UNK> himself is a native of monroe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to court her but the <UNK> of the civil war calls him away <UNK> legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern <UNK> general <UNK> stuart during the battle of <UNK> while on leave he travels to monroe and <UNK> elizabeth who promises him her hand in <UNK> immediately after the war <UNK> and elizabeth bacon are married br br with the civil war over <UNK> is doesn't get a real command and has to go through the <UNK> slow process of promotion in the small professional american army as he starts to drink his wife <UNK> in his behalf with former general in chief <UNK> scott <UNK> is given the command of the us <UNK> <UNK> which he trains to be an elite unit neither <UNK> nor crazy horse are <UNK> of battle but greedy <UNK> and corrupt politicians decide to build a <UNK> through indian lands in clear <UNK> to earlier <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the justice of crazy <UNK> cause but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier exposing the conspiracy of the <UNK> interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle br br they died with their boots on though short on historical accuracy is as good as war movies and westerns in the 1940s got both <UNK> and crazy horse are played by major actors neither the indians nor the southern <UNK> are <UNK> and the <UNK> scenes with beautiful de <UNK> are just charming the only minus and that's why i can't give this picture a full 10 is the <UNK> of racism in the portrayal of african american servants <UNK> servant is the stereotypical overweight good natured <UNK> black <UNK> br br it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either <UNK> or crazy horse but with the greed of the <UNK> companies <UNK> washington politicians with semi criminal methods into breaking <UNK> they had given to the native americans just a couple of years later the <UNK> that american could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist <UNK> br br needless to say that they died with their boots on <UNK> the fact that <UNK> overly aggressive tactics often <UNK> on the <UNK> greatly <UNK> the importance of his engagement with stuart and doesn't mention the lack of <UNK> prior to the battle of the little big horn nevertheless <UNK> was seen as a war hero by his <UNK> and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of <UNK> station <UNK> station and others though his <UNK> of arms were not as <UNK> for the civil war as they died with their boots on suggests br br in any event they died with their boots on is a well made war movie with western elements three outstanding performers flynn quinn and de <UNK> and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money which wouldn't be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come it would deserve a 10 if it weren't for the racist of african americans
<START> ok this will contain spoilers now i have never seen such a large pile of <UNK> since the <UNK> feed mix up at the elephant <UNK> in the <UNK> it has more plot holes than <UNK> eaten <UNK> and as for the <UNK> plot line well sexual slavery is a dreadful and very real world wide problem and this pile of <UNK> <UNK> this plague as a plot device to <UNK> and <UNK> shame on everyone involved for that piece of questionable judgement but back to the film if you were going to kidnap people from an airport some of the most secure and camera happy places in the modern world by the way then why plant a <UNK> on the inside of the van who does <UNK> all until the plot needs a twist just wait until you are out of the airport pull the gun <UNK> the passengers drive <UNK> to the warehouse and kill the guys job done on the passengers side on at least three occasions the good guys have the bad guys <UNK> and are armed waste them once in a movie it can just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the bad guys skull but come on three times and after he's killed most of you also the guy is willing to put down the gun to stop a <UNK> cheek but kills a girl for a <UNK> <UNK> that could be <UNK> up with 20 dollars worth of drugs i could go on and on about the amount of holes in this but i won't waste any more of my time suffice to say that i have rarely been so insulted by such a dreadful piece of drivel and as for the real problem of sexual slavery girls go <UNK> to new in distant lands and are abused raped and often killed by the gang master who meets them off the boat plane and takes their <UNK> and freedom this s t is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by this do not waste your time
<START> not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires touching our favorite trash cult genre is nice unfortunately this movie of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards seem the <UNK> intention to make it cult it failed trash movies are trash movies because it happens you cant create in purpose this kind of films i don't know if mr is a legend first time i heard his name but if he is i wonder the reason br br awful even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic x films will not be satisfied as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires
<START> i would be interested to hear from the director <UNK> <UNK> as to why he decided to make more his first film and more specifically what his interest in hippies or rather this form of the euro hippie paradise and about their demise the film is at least true enough to keep one interested but in its own kind of truth it's strange biased it's a given heroin aka horse is awful stuff rotten the conclusion for many a dumb headed drug user that sees that as the be all end all because it basically is after that everything else stops that becomes the life and it's either a continuous run for more of the same or death more starts off as something concerning a romance between a new york girl and a german man but it becomes something else for better or worse sometimes both in the same scene br br it's basically about two young people <UNK> and <UNK> who meet in a city where <UNK> has come as a sort of <UNK> away from his home country she's wandering too sort of and is maybe too friendly with a big time <UNK> named wolf they end up on a remote island somewhere nearby and after a somewhat daring grab for some horse by <UNK> they also find a pad in the form of a seemingly house along the <UNK> comment on youth and sex and drugs isn't too simplistic which makes the film actually <UNK> and intelligent so many years later it's both direct and subtle more about the characters and then about the fact that what he's depicting could in other hands just be a <UNK> hippie exploitation picture perhaps most pleasantly and this is just a guess <UNK> uses as inspiration the sort of long sequence from <UNK> summer with <UNK> two kids in an <UNK> connection some good some definitely not so good set against too perfectly shot landscapes br br on the one hand i should mention that there are problems some big ones in fact the performances aren't very convincing throughout a few scenes strike some power or have the actors in a good connection with one another but <UNK> <UNK> himself even if he is an <UNK> german by nature in that case i would've preferred <UNK> kinski in the part to make it <UNK> but deep enough for the subject matter as does farmer to her own degree and there's gaps of <UNK> in the screenplay that keep it from being as deep as it really thinks it is on the other hand there are two big things going for it <UNK> the great cinematographer i e days of heaven is <UNK> and is a big boost for a first time director like <UNK> nearly every image is seen with an awesome purpose or artistry be it a shot of the <UNK> by the sea or sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room br br the other thing is pink <UNK> probably the main reason i and many others have heard of the film in the first place years before i knew really who <UNK> was i saw the more soundtrack whenever i looked up pink <UNK> albums it's very good music throughout occasionally the mind blowing variety that gives them the reputation they deserve some of it too is a little tedious even as it is a movie that concerns free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both at the same time i wouldn't rank it anywhere near as high as a <UNK> or animals certainly not dark side but it too helps to elevate the subject matter another notch particularly when one least expects it or in low tones or floating in and out of buildings as <UNK> or other walks on the streets it's almost better atmosphere than the movie itself deserves but overall more is still worth watching as a period piece dated but potent like a less ambitious but more substantial zabriskie point
<START> this film has got so much in it <UNK> society adventure romance true <UNK> violence sex religion all depicted <UNK> without a single word <UNK> and how come it sucks so bad this film will make you <UNK> the origin of humanity if this were the product of <UNK> you would rather defy <UNK> theory and <UNK> all together you cannot bear to watch this even with your brain shut down and now you are thinking i've got to see this i warned you i take no responsibility whatsoever should you regret spending over an hour staring at this piece of art well i did warn you this should be forgotten and buried for ever
<START> this film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the very <UNK> end br br the plot is confused and <UNK> the actors have a couldn't care less attitude maybe they were paid in advance bad move or knew they weren't going to get paid and the sets were <UNK> boring and cheap br br i fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as i assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then more life time wasted br br if you must watch it then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping <UNK> for once but maybe you'll need an <UNK> instead br br sometimes it's good if celluloid <UNK>
<START> wow this movie sucked br br this movie was a embarrassment to the original br br everything about this movie was awful br br the acting was horrendous every part except the part of the manager was terrible br br luke perry though only bit parts was absolutely awful this was is worst role ever even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone you'd want to punch even in the end lol br br this movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage the humor was for 6 year olds br br if your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead
<START> perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the usa runs short at 70 episodes in four seasons br br unlike the often <UNK> criticism found in the simpsons a pretty good show in its own right and the rude for <UNK> sake humour in south park every bit of this series follows a plan the criticism of us society from its to its <UNK> carries much more bite than it does in any other animated series br br the cultural references in also tend to be obscure sometimes anyone <UNK> the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught in that it is different from the simpsons which usually uses pop culture instead of the high brow stuff often hidden in as other people writing about it notice there is a growth in the characters <UNK> and also by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy as is made clear in episodes like the once and future duck love her until the end of your days ' and in takes a holiday when he takes a chance to tell beverly all those things he couldn't tell <UNK> the series is <UNK> in a deep sense of reality br br one can't avoid feeling sorry for him and his <UNK> madness br br all in all in my opinion the best cartoon ever made in the usa and one of the best series ever i doubt it will ever be on dvd though far too many things the duck said make much more sense today
<START> this movie desperate <UNK> was i'm not quite sure how to even put it into words was this supposed to be a comedy i couldn't stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was i love michael keaton and i cannot actually comprehend that he did this they did a good job at keeping my attention because i couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it was going to get minute by minute i actually just <UNK> on this site so that i could get this out i don't review movies i don't have time for this but i cannot let this go knowing i haven't done my civil duty by letting people those who have an iq of 85 and above know that this is no action thriller it is honest to goodness funny you people that actually got thrills off of this scare me go watch a good movie like million dollar baby clint eastwood's acting is not superb but i was <UNK> at the end exercise your brain america
<START> spoiler alert please don't read if you don't want the movie spoiled br br i was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it so me my friend made plans to see it after school today boy are we glad we did the movie starts off in italy with a planned heist with a group of guys charlie mark <UNK> steve edward norton <UNK> also known as seth green you'll get the <UNK> later handsome rob jason <UNK> left ear <UNK> deaf john donald sutherland plan a heist to steal <UNK> gold <UNK> this leads to the whole opening which is a good 10 to 15 minutes and involves a boat chase which opens the movie up right while driving away in their get away van steve turns on the group steals the gold and kills john who is pretty much the <UNK> leader of the group fast to a year later where where stella <UNK> <UNK> john's daughter is one of the top safe <UNK> that anyone can ask for charlie who was actually <UNK> responsible for her father's death as he called him out of retirement for the heist says that they've found steve who has gone into hiding and want to get back at him for what he did she at first <UNK> but later agrees and the back together along with getting the help of <UNK> <UNK> g a mechanic to carry out the perfect heist while creating one of the largest traffic <UNK> in los angeles history this movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout there's an on running joke about seth <UNK> character <UNK> creating and how shawn fanning who makes a cameo stole it while he fell asleep and eventually <UNK> will only answer if <UNK> to as there's even a funny line in the movie by seth who goes he said in an interview he called it because it described his hair like it was <UNK> he it that because i was <UNK> when he stole it the <UNK> and ending sequences are pure genius and everything in between fits perfectly the only negative thing i can think of with the movie is that edward <UNK> acting was a bit weak he wasn't a big tough bad guy he acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare minimum which is a fact as he was forced to do this movie due to <UNK> <UNK> but even with that problem being the only real <UNK> with the film the movie is still very enjoyable and i <UNK> recommend seeing it and even if you're not interested in the actual movie go to see seth green shine in the comedic role he's perfect rating out of
<START> this movie is excellent the passion between <UNK> billy is memorable and the acting was great this is why you don't leave a 16 year old and a young man like that alone together it shows why a single mother shouldn't date a younger man with a teen aged daughter in the house cause he looked young enough to be son br br i give it ten out of ten the acting was wonderful and the movements between the actors was correct br br the age difference between jenny and rob was good too because they were similar in age br br overall its a fun movie but i think nobody under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes
<START> some tv programs continue into embarrassment my beloved <UNK> <UNK> comes to mind i've been a fan of dennis <UNK> since <UNK> story ' another late <UNK> show <UNK> never had a chance the series had a good premise and great actors it's really really a shame
<START> how do i describe the horrors first some points first this review should be taken with a grain of salt i saw this over 20 years ago when i was a boy at the museum of modern art in new york city br br secondly i am giving away some scenes and plot points however it does not have much of a plot br br finally i don't enjoy these type of art films anyway br br this film was directed by <UNK> auteur luis <UNK> he was a <UNK> and <UNK> these were <UNK> themes or movements popular <UNK> in the <UNK> and early 1930's was the school of art that made things hyper real yet often had <UNK> symbolism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an <UNK> <UNK> or father br br made in black and white it was also made by a band of <UNK> or as they preferred the term <UNK> <UNK> and his group of fellow film makers and <UNK> had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in spain and france between the world wars br br and <UNK> influenced a lot of artists the police doo doo doo da poet arthur <UNK> the scream <UNK> <UNK> floating hats in space <UNK> <UNK> melting <UNK> and even hitchcock psycho no norman <UNK> br br here's what i recall most about this film a girl meets up with a cow her eye gets <UNK> by a razor <UNK> men <UNK> in a <UNK> there is not as i said much of a plot but then again that must be the point br br this was attacked as porn back then and would be again today one of the trade marks of <UNK> is a significant anti <UNK>
<START> university professor justin <UNK> jimmy has got it made a good looking sophisticated teacher with a loving wife and two adorable children he plays the <UNK> owns an expensive car and his students love and respect him but when temptation calls in the form of one of his bright pretty sexy and willing students jennifer carter <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> gives in the next day he is being charged with her rape and his perfect life could be forever ruined br br when we see an american actor in australian film we know we are not in for a masterpiece but even viewed with low expectations gross <UNK> is a huge flop based on a play with a rather unimaginative title and then adapted into a reasonably enjoyable book it fails to engage convince or even remotely interest its audience on a most fundamental level the script is awkward and unconvincing the acting is for most part not much better <UNK> gives an acceptable performance <UNK> for one of the first times on screen her emotion <UNK> but she is the only good thing about the film which seems almost like even it can't wait to be over br br the direction is not horrible or distracting in anyway but it is just painfully mediocre apart from the <UNK> mentioned <UNK> <UNK> who could be forgiven seeing as this was early in her career the acting is wooden and gets <UNK> worse over the course of the movie the usually reliable jimmy doesn't seem to have been trying in this one and who could really blame him all these small failures however only add to the film's ultimate fatal flaw which is that the focus is entirely in the wrong place any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome is lost in a sea of what is basically soft core entertainment of an adult kind by the end audiences will probably be bored tired and wishing they'd done something else with their ninety minutes unless you just want to see <UNK> get naked 4 or 5 times you could definitely afford to give this film a miss
<START> another go round with the monkey king going west sort of br br beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame <UNK> br br a monk and his three <UNK> go to a town to get the sacred that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world but an evil force has <UNK> and kidnapped all of the children of the town the evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever the battle the forces of darkness before <UNK> sending the monk off for safety the monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys the monk ends up with a bunch of lizard <UNK> who plan at some point eating him however the bad guys arrive and he's off an odyssey with the <UNK> of the lot br br can a movie that starts off the <UNK> go off the <UNK> don't get me wrong i really liked this movie but its so <UNK> shot and all over the place that plot and logic simply fall away as some scenes simply pick up mid action with no way of knowing how we got there the final battle to rescue the <UNK> is completely out of left field this is one of the <UNK> movies i've seen in a while but it made me laugh and smile like no get out the movie starts and you have no idea where things are and then whats on screen is either interesting or funny and you just go with it how do we get from thing to thing is often beyond me its full of odd <UNK> and strange references as we go from heaven to the ocean to space to the <UNK> cage of some <UNK> beast to god knows where this movie <UNK> all over the place which helps keep it fun since you don't know where it will end up and is the reason m keeping details to a minimum and its funny very very funny at times br br and the action is very good even if a good <UNK> of it is <UNK> cgi animation which provides for some cool images the golden staff the spider attack <UNK> the angel in flight and its very touching action and comedy aside this is actually a wonderful love story its the story of an ugly <UNK> and a monk who end up falling in love and having other complications its a interesting look at the nature of love and what is true love you will be moved br br however much i enjoyed it i was still annoyed by its <UNK> shot construction the films inability to hold its ideas together and to tell a complete story really hurts the film and takes away from the enjoyment every time we get to a <UNK> in the road the <UNK> take you out of the movie itself and make you realize how much is being <UNK> from other sources br br absolutely worth seeing since it does have many choice moments just be prepared for some <UNK> and you'll have a good time
<START> lets face it australian tv is for the most part terrible but this is a real diamond in the rough that not enough people are watching the <UNK> crew who do the satirical newspaper and try something new by mixing live comedy pre recorded skits and political satire into one show filmed in front of a live audience sorta like <UNK> but funny they love causing controversy and this causes some of the shows funniest moments especially chris telling his wife to f off live on breakfast television and julian <UNK> a novelty <UNK> signed by <UNK> to the head of the it has to be one of the funniest aussie shows since the program
<START> this movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that have done br br it looks like a commercial from beginning to end the the whole time on a <UNK> it doesn't have pace rhythm it's illogical what a mess you can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes and the ending wow br br spoiler br br jesus christ how the hell got shot are you serious worst scene of someone getting shot ever br br end of spoiler br br bad directing bad script bad acting really bad overall i wouldn't recommend this movie at all it's a waste of money and time
<START> i haven't actually seen a lot of movies with holly hunter but seeing her in broadcast news was a pleasant surprise she is a hard <UNK> journalist jane craig who has devoted all of her time to tv news show her colleague aaron altman has carried her torch for a long time without saying anything the love triangle is completed by tom he is the slightly <UNK> ex <UNK> who is the new reporter to jane he <UNK> everything she doesn't like about news <UNK> turning it into not serious business much to her surprise jane finds herself attracted to tom br br holly hunter is doing a great performance as the <UNK> journalist but i don't quite see what she finds so charming about her new colleague tom it's something with them that <UNK> us from getting up close and personal with him almost as impressive is albert brooks who gives his all in the role of a professional who gives more than 100 percent for his job but doesn't get quite as much in return actually for a while i thought he was steve <UNK> from police academy 1984 he has a few funny lines and if this was a meg ryan picture they'd call it a romantic comedy br br running over two hours a few scenes could have been edited or left out completely <UNK> jane's and <UNK> trip to central america also i'm a sucker for happy endings and had preferred a different ending than just a reunion between the three of them seven years later
<START> bloody marvelous recommended by a friend who knew i liked thomas <UNK> in the <UNK> and downfall i loved the flow of the narrative how the characters moved from hope and ideals of <UNK> through shock fear <UNK> desperation and utter <UNK> a first rate anti war movie that must have created quite the stir in germany not a proud moment for anyone and the study of a generation lost this movie was excellent at conveying the remove of the command from the ground troops and in <UNK> the utter <UNK> of trying to control <UNK> nature and the russian psyche if i didn't know i would have thought it was a russian movie it was so <UNK> what an <UNK> ending a
<START> mind numbingly boring utterly predictable and in the end simply laughable that pretty much sums up the disaster that is <UNK> <UNK> starting with a decent premise the whole thing just <UNK> and becomes a complete mess basically the story <UNK> down to the question would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars here of course the answer is yes because otherwise we wouldn't have a movie quite frankly we'd have been better off if we didn't have a movie br br our married and <UNK> troubled couple are played by woody <UNK> and <UNK> moore they go to vegas to get rich yeah that'll work anyhow a <UNK> played by robert redford takes a liking to the wife and makes the million dollar offer for one night with the wife he will give them financial security the aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining the script is so predictable you can say the characters' lines before they do the performances leave much to be desired <UNK> would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying and it is quite safe to say that <UNK> moore will never have to clear space in her home for any academy awards why is she a movie star again in a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none only redford escapes mostly <UNK> he's appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch but he can't save this film awful script lousy acting plodding pace zero entertainment <UNK> <UNK> is downright awful
<START> i have loved one true thing since the first time i watched it in the theater and cried my eyes out i bought it as soon as it was available and have lost track of how many times i've watched it br br to me one true thing is the ultimate family relationship movie i love watching the relationships in the family change and <UNK> into what they end up being i can relate to many details in the movie my mother died of bone cancer so it really hits home with me maybe this is why i love it so much br br i like the relationships between the children and their parents and the relationship of brother and sister but especially love the relationship between husband and wife to me it is truly beautiful br br i highly recommend this move to anyone who enjoys this kind of movie
<START> william <UNK> was one of the american writers to win the <UNK> prize in literature <UNK> mostly wrote about life in the south particularly during the depression years many of his stories have been adapted to screen short stories like two soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in december 1941 after the attack on pearl harbor the older brother pete <UNK> goes to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> like hundreds of thousands of young men some who would never come home his younger brother doesn't take his departure well he manages to get a bus ticket to <UNK> without any money to find his brother he surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since he wants to <UNK> also at 10 years old ron <UNK> does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy this short film won an oscar for best short live action film which is well deserved if it was longer it could compete with the longer films everything else like costumes art direction and <UNK> the era of america in 1941 is perfect the film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most americans were surviving the great depression the actors and actresses are not known but they do a first rate performances if hollywood would make more quality films i would probably go to the cinema more if broadway had more quality shows i would go to the theater more
<START> all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid it is pretty boring and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff a couple <UNK> <UNK> over their good a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes sits down and answers it at a pretty <UNK> pace <UNK> takes or more when people look at things <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and playing taking a break for a beer telling a joke to a <UNK> about a big mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies complete with many big mouthed expressions which are needed for the weak punchline the sharing of <UNK> and cream cheese <UNK> on <UNK> bread which to the <UNK> become <UNK> when there's talk of people burned in a fire lots of seemingly stock footage close up shots of animals birds insects and <UNK> in the woods br br the movie starts with a forest fire then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe the killer evidently wasn't too satisfied by the axe he stole and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands br br if it's true that the movie in the version available on the out of print <UNK> is cut perhaps if there's a lot of footage that was cut it deserves another look on dvd otherwise it's simply not very interesting and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore <UNK> slasher fan
<START> i gave this a 10 because it's the best film of its kind a good old fashioned t a film in the shadow and spirit of animal house i saw this with a similar film called <UNK> meet and both were good of their type a great way to spend a saturday afternoon let's be honest there are more breasts in this movie than one could imagine for an r rated movie from beginning to end they just seem to keep showing up on screen <UNK> scenes bedroom scenes and of course the climactic football game also a memorable kissing booth kiss me everybody seems to be having a good time in their roles several playboy <UNK> danny <UNK> several familiar tv and movie actors etc the only complaint i have to register is that lisa <UNK> character is called by her last name o'hara and not a good 1970s name like olivia or even <UNK> or <UNK> or o i saw this again in the late 1980s with my now ex wife pretty well <UNK> herself and she couldn't believe i was actually enjoying the movie she was probably jealous again this movie is a great way to spend a saturday afternoon just don't think too hard
<START> this film is really really full of sex hot sex i watched it of course on <UNK> and i liked it of course those virtual fantasies are played out so much in great style and i kind of enjoyed the story line but one must know that when a soft porn film director sets out to make another soft porn film all he she wants to do is film good sex scenes and i got nice sex scenes full of skin yet another reason some people call soft porn <UNK> films <UNK>
<START> as a perfect day for ends with the suicide of a <UNK> this movie opens with the death of the star high school <UNK> legend matt who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene but the death of matt travis serves as a key to <UNK> the door of another <UNK> his brother tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question what am i going to do br br when he finds his brother dead his head broken like a dropped <UNK> the travis family starts <UNK> out its secrets one by one the film focuses on tim he is a victim of bullying domestic abuse family alienation <UNK> issues of sexuality and friendship br br tim reveals his wounds by physical <UNK> but these are not the only <UNK> to his person as we slowly come to realize as the script painfully <UNK> the origins and outcome of tim <UNK> everyone who loves him hurts him <UNK> plays out the character quite well revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body a host of <UNK> emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well <UNK> and unaware of his depth of soul and <UNK> talent br br two siblings sharing a <UNK> <UNK> up on a red <UNK> <UNK> tim asks penny what am i going to do with the rest of my life the scene is framed in a familiar recurring image of the film the comfortable <UNK> where tim obviously feels at home filmed from a <UNK> eye view because with every character tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red <UNK> <UNK> complete with childish <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> from above after <UNK> him to pass the joint penny tells him tim well the secret to the success of life is to find something you love and you have to do that for the rest of your life  and you better hope to hell that you're good at it because if you're not then you'll probably fail this simple line of advice from penny serves as the movie's central theme the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure why does one person have a talent he cannot stand like matt who hated the attention his swimming fame brought but no one notices <UNK> talent  no one  because no one bothers to ask him not even us the film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome sad guy in our intimate understanding of tim as it progresses we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be this is the other side of the film the failure of those who should  parents friends teachers  whoever  to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love not even his mother sandy played by <UNK> weaver sees <UNK> gift despite her love for her son weaver does a <UNK> job of a middle aged woman <UNK> with her own inner demons as she <UNK> tries to play the roles of <UNK> and support when tim is found to be <UNK> at school she <UNK> the boy's trailer threatening his life you can <UNK> torture punch drive drunk with me i can forgive you hell i can understand it i'm a good christian you know i can forgive and forget but you mess with my kid and may god himself <UNK> from heaven to protect you because as long as i live  and i will <UNK> you all  i will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth after <UNK> a paper cup into the mother's face she looks around the trailer and looking at them both the kid and his stunned mother comments nice trailer and leaves as quickly as she came weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty and <UNK> father played by jeff daniels is blind to who his son is treating him like a stranger not telling his family that he took time off from the office spending his days in the city park <UNK> a <UNK> out soul and sleeping in <UNK> bed <UNK> in with his high school letter jacket jeff daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son in an emotional scene tim confronts his father just when you think his dad is going to hit him he grabs for him to embrace him not letting him go he tells tim i am your father and you're are my son and i'm here okay but you've gotta talk to me i don't know how to do this by myself it is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son you have to tell me what's going on inside of you you have to tell me who you are i want to know who you are it is in this scene that the film reaches a <UNK> moment the visual movement from tim angry and alone to his father <UNK> him as he breaks downs and <UNK> revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell tim experiences this moment of <UNK> with his dad as a <UNK> especially when you consider the <UNK> manipulation disregard violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film <UNK> i recommend this film
<START> <UNK> is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to <UNK> psychological thriller is the most appropriate description i can think of the female protagonist alice discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel she is also haunted by a recurring very vivid dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago in her pursuit of the truth behind her <UNK> she doesn't trust anyone but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold and particularly how it will end the unusual loneliness of the main character and the of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well the important part of the one and only everyone's all time favorite <UNK> obnoxious child star of italian horror is an extra bonus
<START> <UNK> colorful characters family relationships <UNK> with <UNK> living with fun and humor this film has it all and more what a great <UNK> man and woman ' story with a top notch plot and script it offers just clean fun lots of laughter many smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family other reviewers describe the story some i'll just offer this comparison <UNK>  it's part best of show grumpy old men millions and some other comedy and life flicks rolled into one br br this gem of a film most likely had limited release and is probably not very available to rent but it's now out on dvd and i highly recommend it for purchase if you like good old fashioned fun and entertaining films for the family you can't miss with <UNK> from heaven this film is a sure fire cure for the blues or to chase the <UNK> away on nasty weather days or rough times
<START> i was lucky enough to have seen this film at it's seattle film fest screening and was blown away by how great it was this is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries i've ever seen and i've seen a lot this is a loving look back at the life and times music and relationships of one of <UNK> true legends harry <UNK> deserves to be up there with the likes of gershwin cole porter and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards he was considered a <UNK> by all four members of the beatles who all called him a <UNK> <UNK> and one the same <UNK> as themselves br br harry refused to tour so many today don't remember him and those born after his <UNK> are unaware of who he was this is tragic everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent this film is a step in the right direction to finally give the man his due unfortunately the film has yet to have wide distribution or even a dvd so for the time being good luck in getting to see it br br if you are someone with the power to put together a dvd distribution deal please contact the film makers this film needs to be available hey <UNK> 1 how about screening it on air then maybe putting it out on dvd harry <UNK> deserves nothing less
<START> i had seen the cure when i was a kid and i loved it then now years later i got a hold of a copy almost by accident and watched it again being a kid you don't really have the ability to <UNK> things for yourself that you want that is usually a of your parents but when i watched it again now i felt sorry that i did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then and consequently almost forgot about it until today br br this really is a beautiful movie it tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard edged <UNK> kid who takes his <UNK> from his horrible abusive mother and his neighbor a slightly younger boy who has aids br br right you say another one of those a tear <UNK> a bucket movie a morality tail yeah i know i hate those too only this one isn't it is one of the very few movies among those many i have seen that pulls off a very rare trick it conveys a truly sad story and yes a morality tale but without a single moment where it feels cheesy forced or in any other way it shows a real relationship between two real boys who interact as real kids do and through that interaction the good natured loving character of the older boy eric starts to shine through his tough guy persona as he takes on a kind of big <UNK> care for <UNK> his hiv positive younger neighbor together they <UNK> on an adventure to find a cure which to <UNK> seems to be just around the corner so that all this silly aids thing will go away and they can be friends forever br br the production is top notch but of course what really carries this movie is the performances of the two leads brad and joseph especially who is simply stunning he does convey a sense of <UNK> needed for an <UNK> boy but at the same time he manages to make <UNK> a truly energetic and determined character he shines at the scene where the boys confront <UNK> his <UNK> to protect his older friend <UNK> him forth drives him to say what he says and only afterwards the horror is depicted on his face as he realizes that what he himself said is true his blood is poison also has his moments in particular the scenes with his mother he depicts perfectly how this macho street wise kid is left completely frozen and <UNK> when faced with his abusive <UNK> mother and can't get a word in to <UNK> her as she <UNK> his relationship with the <UNK> boy out of her fear and ignorance <UNK> <UNK> also gives a memorable performance as <UNK> mother who ultimately becomes in a sense a mother figure to <UNK> as well br br i've first seen this film when i was at school back in america and loved it not at all a given concerning movies of this sort but the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real i could easily relate to them ironically enough the teacher who had shown us this movie a wonderful woman i'm still in touch with her got in trouble for it as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a playboy pathetic seriously will americans ever get over this ridiculous <UNK> i do not know there was a hardly <UNK> shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools how sad kids need to see this movie it is more inspiring and educational than all the official after school <UNK> put together br br oh and one more thing i know i'm rambling but nevertheless the score it's great i am a musician and as such i know dave from his records he is a well known jazz <UNK> and record producer up until this movie i really did not know that he did movie scores as well even though when i later checked i found out that i had <UNK> watched several movies he worked on really a wonderful job there br br all in all a solid ten i'd recommend this movie to anyone and i'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special effect <UNK> they usually see
<START> if you like gary cooper this is one of his best roles his gentle intensity to right a wrong is what made his career <UNK> comes to dallas to take revenge against will and brian who burned his georgia farm and killed his family inept marshall gets in way attempting to arrest him when interrupted by a street shootout between <UNK> and wild bill <UNK> the shootout is staged to get the law off <UNK> he takes the back east marshall under his wing to keep him alive in texas as they switch identity br br that was a great beginning and the picture holds up all the way through action may be a little slow by today's standards but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies
<START> this movie is painful that's probably the best way to describe it it's <UNK> minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back well actually it's more like <UNK> minutes because there is no way anyone would want to sit through the credits in this <UNK> pile of dog <UNK> immediately you can tell the movie is from the producer of mortal <UNK> due to it's <UNK> and annoying <UNK> soundtrack this <UNK> the few laughably enjoyable moments this movie can give you the rest is <UNK> by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters the <UNK> <UNK> jr school of acting acting abilities of all involved including the miscast christopher <UNK> and the non <UNK> directing did i leave anything out of course i did let's not forget about the suicide inducing script with it's funny dialogue oh yes and let us also talk about how they <UNK> the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic medieval translation the costumes and weapons were those giant pizza <UNK> i kept seeing are just plain stupid that's the best way i can describe them and the last <UNK> of the night is the always awful cgi when will filmmakers learn that cgi sucks when will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80's probably never but films like this and star wars episode 1 the phantom menace make us wish that they would bring them back in closing avoid this movie like the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr movie then again if you like <UNK> <UNK> jr movies then you deserve to sit through this horrid excuse for filmmaking
<START> first off this film has no story it's obvious there were a lot of <UNK> during production sometimes characters reference a <UNK> that is impossible and this is probably because the <UNK> of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set br br that said the film is kinda brilliant pfeiffer is amazing and i mean amazing as <UNK> she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good bad <UNK> walken is walken but even more nasty than usual <UNK> is not true to the comic book when it comes to penguin but he is good and memorable br br keaton is underrated as batman br br and the music and style are pure cinema thrill true the 3rd act doesn't work but the final 2 scenes are <UNK> and it's clear pfeiffer and keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got <UNK> by this film's kinky darkness that's too bad because <UNK> and keaton had classic chemistry and had they acted in a third installment joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy batman for an entire generation of movie fans
<START> i first saw this film about 15 years ago and i have been enchanted by it ever since it is such a feel good experience that i could happily watch it at any time of the year however to me it is the ultimate christmas movie br br the fact that it is in b w is irrelevant although i often wonder what it would be like in colour you can just get that warm glowing feeling watching the christmas events unfold br br stanwyck and morgan are perfect together and <UNK> is the <UNK> of his usual character is a <UNK> joy to watch br br it is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it br br i can't wait for it to become available on dvd in the uk i shall certainly be at the front of the <UNK> to buy it
<START> if only he hadn't <UNK> to cliché mr could have actually made a good film from this story it was just different enough to keep you interested so for the same amount of time energy and money as was spent on this stinker we might have had something good instead of eye rolling br br production wise it is as good as one could really expect from a hand held camcorder so he gets good marks there it's really the script that's at fault as the acting wasn't all that bad either considering what the actors had to work with br br i thought the days were long gone when we would see someone finding a radio <UNK> they desperately wish to operate first turn every <UNK> on the thing from end to end bash it on top 6 or 7 times and then expect it to work this story is ruined by a continuous string of stupid moves by all the characters except the bad guy it's as though we are thought to be too shallow to grasp all the plot devices so they are all <UNK> fed to us to make sure we get them br br i don't know about you but that doesn't work on me my attention ends up being occupied by the plot holes and over <UNK> not the story br br so since i found this to be not so bad in the technical sense i think mr should try again only with a proper script next time then he might give us something worth watching
<START> i thought this movie was quite good it was on tcm turner classic movies at three am one night and its offbeat humor kept me up <UNK> five kelly performs beautifully in this role especially with the grandma whose <UNK> almost caused me to laugh out of my seat the main actress was alright but the father was able to keep his character isolated from the marriage conflict and kept the humor coming if you like a good offbeat older movie i would recommend it unlike the other comment i do like gene kelly he was the perfect leading actor for many of the early musicals and i think in this role he <UNK> his charisma one <UNK> is the dance scenes get a little long <UNK> but if you can get through those you're in the clear
<START> ridiculous nauseating <UNK> with terrible acting <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all the most banal clichés about <UNK> and italy divorce and <UNK> the main actor <UNK> <UNK> her way through the film struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug self <UNK> self pity the worthless character and script call for i'm sure the book was bad but it can't have been this bad the camera is <UNK> <UNK> with a vomit yellow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perhaps the <UNK> sun wasn't <UNK> enough which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to rome and how imaginative the coast you've never seen the white <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> looking so yellow i mean <UNK> one of the worst movies ever and therefore quite worth a look
<START> this is one of the finest tv movies you could ever see the acting writing and production values are top notch the performances are passionate with beverly <UNK> superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and rob <UNK> simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend however the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending it showed that abuse can happen in good families involve good people and wreck lives it is thought provoking and entertaining <UNK> to all concerned with this exceptional movie br br
<START> i felt cheated out of knowing the whole story while there could be a twist this twist was so significant that i felt betrayed i believe it could have used a better writer who could <UNK> all the elements of the story together better the writer could have revealed more of the <UNK> throughout the movie rather than all at once at the end that aside i believe that the actors did very well with what they had particularly matt damon who actually had a little character in his character little quirks that weren't <UNK> or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing the other main characters were their own separate <UNK> who just happened to <UNK> with one another the <UNK> of the group in <UNK> eleven was gone
<START> i laughed so much when i saw this film i nearly <UNK> myself awful acting laughable effects super <UNK> explosions and dodgy slow motion fighting br br one of the worst films i've ever seen
<START> grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long it's <UNK> 4 am here and because it's norwegian which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now a <UNK> and deliciously <UNK> romp this movie features a man <UNK> who gets <UNK> out to some <UNK> of a brave new world city where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste nothing <UNK> and even sex loses its appeal driven to the edge by his lack of common senses he feels nearly ready to kill himself br br after an hilarious <UNK> attempt at latter <UNK> tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny <UNK> shaped hole in a <UNK> wall from which music <UNK> the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see but of course in fantasy allegory land desire and <UNK> are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end attempt at freedom and <UNK> br br <UNK> and crew create a simple straight forward movement to the story one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from <UNK> the similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth <UNK> but still the movie has a unique feel and <UNK> some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie some <UNK> and that will get your heart <UNK> harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray toned <UNK> en scene is a <UNK> <UNK> actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings which works very well despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world br br <UNK>
<START> this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror but not for obvious reasons the horror of a tale of two sisters lies not with sudden shocks or large <UNK> of cgi guts and gore it is a psychological horror movie which the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout best of all the ending does not provide a clear answer pushing the viewer to <UNK> what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place br br do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately this is not the conventional hack and slash movie with <UNK> <UNK> designed to make you scared of nothing in particular a tale of two sisters slowly builds an atmosphere of terror a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which <UNK> explanation until the very end even when the final conclusion is revealed it is not so heavy handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene some things will still be open to interpretation and this is one of the <UNK> of watching a film such as this br br the true fear of a tale of two sisters lies not in shocks or <UNK> scares it is a psychological gut wrenching horror that defies convention and <UNK> a genre to proportions <UNK> <UNK> by the traditional horror film it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so called <UNK> <UNK> genre indeed it would be a mistake to <UNK> a tale of two sisters with films like <UNK> and the grudge this movie can be understood from a variety of <UNK> some <UNK> no suspension of <UNK> others <UNK> the supernatural <UNK> br br <UNK> way you choose to interpret this film it is one that demands an open minded approach rewarding viewers regardless of their <UNK> notions on asian cinema or horror in general
<START> i wasn't really interested in seeing step up but my friend just kept <UNK> and <UNK> me to see this film especially since she is so in love with <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> her constantly about it saying how that's the only reason why she loved the movie but she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing that if i loved movies like dirty dancing take the lead and save the last dance that i should love step up eh what the heck i guess every movie in some way has it's right to a view br br well you know those movies i just mentioned up top dirty dancing take the lead and save the last dance well put them in a <UNK> with some <UNK> love in it and that's what you have not to mention if you've seen those movies well frankly you have seen step up because <UNK> is lower class with street <UNK> who just naturally feels the music while that <UNK> up class girl must follow step by step how will they ever fall in love if they are so different after all this is their chance to step up to the passion the mystery and the lust of the dance br br ok that was a silly plot explanation but like i said as long as you've seen those movies i mentioned or even if you just saw the plot you get the movie i don't understand how it actually has a 5 5 rating i bet it's those <UNK> lovers lol i'm kidding with you guys but it's all good i guess i just didn't get what others did with the passion the mystery that is the dance oh antonio where are you when we need you br br 4 10
<START> this is a really dark movie noir indeed the title character is <UNK> brought into new york city <UNK> by evelyn <UNK> br br she is on one mission when she arrives and on a <UNK> one after she's spoken to her no longer innocent sister but she herself is not intentionally a killer this doesn't mean she doesn't kill it doesn't mean her presence somewhere among eight million other people doesn't throw the city into turmoil br br <UNK> is excellent the supporting cast is very good too there are several little known people involved in this the director included don't be put off it is a movie to be <UNK> with and how nice to see a columbia picture columbia and republic turned out wonderful comedies and <UNK> yet we hardly ever see them anymore
<START> i watched because over the last few years michael sheen has become one of my favourite actors and if you haven't seen him in anything before firstly shame on you and secondly get your hands on a copy of either or dirty filthy love this production did not disappoint michael sheen transformed himself almost magically into kenneth williams and gave a performance that was as <UNK> moving as it was <UNK> not to take anything away from the other performances but like kenneth michael truly stole the show i don't know how he does it but every performance i have seen michael give he seems to <UNK> until the character he plays is truly utterly believable and no matter how hard i try i cannot fault him must go get my tea enjoy
<START> when i borrowed this movie i wasn't expecting a high quality performance but this was just sad br br most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried there's nothing quite like seeing a kid <UNK> things like oh no my dad is invisible or i wonder what this does in the same <UNK> that one might <UNK> traffic over the radio with there are some good actors but they are wasted on smaller parts br br the story is decent though it would be fairly easy to guess considering that there aren't too many real plot changes lots of holes too for example the dad is invisible and the <UNK> figures out what part is needed to make him visible again so the boy goes and steals the part from an <UNK> store couldn't he just ask his dad for the cash br br this shows up in the comedy category but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost <UNK> naked during a meeting or walking around with his head covered at all times funny at first but it gets old br br 2 5 because it is watchable and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way like the <UNK> <UNK> of lines
<START> i haven't seen all <UNK> works by any means but his acting in this one was truly awful the other characters run the gamut of ability but having most of the emotional scenes <UNK> scenes are just embarrassing to watch he's certainly come a long ways in 12 years
<START> most families will <UNK> similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by natalie portman and susan sarandon natalie creates an on screen image that <UNK> her as one of the best actresses in america and one worthy of a golden globe nomination the control of her emotions are so in <UNK> that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true <UNK> br br any natalie fan would've seen the film based on her past <UNK> but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film it is a truly <UNK> experience
<START> naturally <UNK> sucks big time i have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage this is not funny its not cute in any way shape or form its just disturbing and a waste of money <UNK> is such a bad actor i lost all my brain cells watching this show it honestly seemed that this show is forced it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap br br this show sucks br br its a waste of time and money don't bother watching this garbage the characters are so stupid and ridiculous in the first season its just dumb and stupid then when i saw the second season i just couldn't take anymore it made me want to kill charlotte arnold the second season is <UNK> absolutely a disgrace to disney this show is also a racist piece of sh
<START> the war at home is so good it's become my new favourite show me and my <UNK> and april watch this together every sunday and laugh at how true to life it is i love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they <UNK> on every little issue once someone does something stupid they never live it down and that is <UNK> how family is the father always <UNK> on all three kids about every little thing i love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kids it's so true to real family life and the fact that the parents are so overwhelmed and have no clue how to solve their teenagers problems just puts the show over the top the war at home is so brutally honest and so true to the world we live in that it has become a <UNK> for sitcoms to come this isn't happy days or the brady bunch this is real life
<START> came across this film recently after so long hearing about it it is an excellent not pretentious movie for people who loves film noir literature and films not camp but humorous br br great cast from the magnificent carla and emma thompson to german superstar <UNK> <UNK> this movie is a feast for the eyes alan <UNK> is very funny as the antagonist of gang would love to see spin off movie with this character and emma thompson solving cases and arguments between them all the time much like tracy and hepburn etc br br intelligent story nice twists and scope photography don't watch unless it is scope because compositions are very rich br br sexy sexy sexy and very fun time br br best use of just like heaven by the cure ever must see to believe br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> young jerk of the <UNK> du cinema main <UNK> of the coming so called new wave made a big show of hating this film and even accused it of dragging french cinema into mediocrity translation <UNK> who was <UNK> repressed sexually was already jealous of the way <UNK> could make a huge success of a story that pushed all the right buttons of its audience and actually involved it into something important with all the <UNK> and seduction of <UNK> in other words where the general public and many critics saw a <UNK> <UNK> analysis wrapped in a beautiful film <UNK> saw girls on the loose br br <UNK> after all had everything that would be severely lacking from the new wave intelligence <UNK> humour a great talent as a <UNK> a great ear for dialogue dazzling technical brilliance the capacity to make his actors do what he wanted them to do and a good dose of good taste by comparison <UNK> is a <UNK> bore with nothing to say br br a 50's tragic remake of pride and prejudice the french answer to rebel without a cause an updated version of children of paradise les tells a story of <UNK> <UNK> youth who have lost their way in an atmosphere of <UNK> sexual <UNK> and <UNK> for traditional and religious values some young critics perceived <UNK> take on the subject as the <UNK> <UNK> of an older person whereas i think what happened quite to the contrary is that <UNK> being gay and knowing a thing or two about <UNK> felt an <UNK> sympathy for the young <UNK> in his story furthermore this being a french film there is no <UNK> that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual something that still had to be <UNK> in american films like rebel without a cause and the wild one br br <UNK> young people are all <UNK> beautiful <UNK> elegant spontaneous and intelligent they are gods and <UNK> they drive the latest and the right cars the cut of their suits dresses and <UNK> <UNK> was a high point of the fashions of the last century their <UNK> are still <UNK> on the wall of your local <UNK> their body shape which they <UNK> and <UNK> without effort is still the modern western ideal they listen to the best jazz musicians they know how to move how to be sexy and how to make love  even though the <UNK> hasn't yet been invented they know how to <UNK> different social classes and cultures unfortunately they are defined by and live by the code of the gang and their own heartless <UNK> that <UNK> sentimentality and make a sin of romantic love the only thing wrong with them is that their <UNK> don't talk to them and vice versa the incidents depicted in this film got a lot of <UNK> <UNK> for a long time in france about the <UNK> and <UNK> of youth while still making it a huge public and critical success br br this film is so stylish and gorgeous i suspect the older viewers who watched it wished they could be like the people depicted in the film and quite a few young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like <UNK> developed a bad case of <UNK> how they could never <UNK> make a film as sexy or popular as this one although they would be very good at eventually aiming for the <UNK> bits on the other hand given a certain clichéd aspect of the script <UNK> <UNK> leading to a medical <UNK> one can only wonder at the horribly <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> americans would have <UNK> from the same basic script if they had <UNK> to tackle the subject br br interestingly the movie was filmed in the same basic locations as the american musical funny face a year earlier where hollywood saw the <UNK> aspects of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> its tragic and ironic dimension watch this trailer on youtube
<START> note the wide release date of <UNK> 8 1945 about a week before japan <UNK> in wwii so there will probably be a message for us in over 21 irene dunne it happened one night the 1939 version of love affair is paula <UNK> who goes to live on an army base while her newspaper editor husband is in training school alexander knox the longest day is her <UNK> max look for charles coburn monkey business gentlemen prefer <UNK> as the <UNK> commanding newspaper boss also look for <UNK> <UNK> as mrs gates from the women bank dick lady war story written for the <UNK> point of view which wasn't too common in those days fun commentary on the <UNK> condition of the married <UNK> wardrobe in this film certainly wasn't at all <UNK> since they never had to leave their little <UNK> it appears the whole movie budget was spent on her always exquisite dresses and hats
<START> simply put i was amazingly disappointed i'm a huge fan of asian horror and i can watch <UNK> i myself enjoyed the red shoes and phone but this was just poor br br the movie has a lot of elements that are very high quality the photography is eye catching the visuals are cool the directing is inspired the acting is pretty good the music is easy on the ears and the cgi is incredible but since this is a horror film we are expected to be scared which just won't happen with this film as with most south korean horrors this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end there's the trademark long haired vengeful female ghost ominous of thick black hair and <UNK> of water and near the end a twist that almost but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing the twist is easily one of the best qualities and to the viewer's <UNK> when the film isn't <UNK> at times so exact that it could easily be dubbed <UNK> imagery from other movies it's making you jump a lot and by jumps i don't mean things jumping out or anything just very loud noises and <UNK> in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air there's even a few made you jump moments that are simply <UNK> and when it is not ripping off other movies it's boring and hard to sit through br br and it's a shame because could have easily been really good and it has everything to make it good but its the annoying <UNK> of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie a perfect example of how good it could have been there's a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse and without a sound the corpse looks back it's wholly predictable but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant and unfortunately that's as scary as the movie got for me br br admittedly has a few good features and even a couple jumps that aren't as predictable and do work there's a very good and sad back story used to explain the events and the twist is pretty unpredictable those are the only things that separate the film from any other asian ghost horror film but the problem with these is even though they do work they have been used before j horror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by a tale of two sisters and it takes the back story a good fifty minutes to get going br br so in the end really seems like a truly wasted opportunity <UNK> <UNK> kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as <UNK> so the audience won't notice the huge flaws but he failed and well we noticed everything br br my rating 4 10
<START> i can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever if you are in the mood for a comedy i totally recommend this movie so here's the summary there is this girl <UNK> who is <UNK> and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father andre whom she hasn't seen for about two years she expects the vacation to be totally boring until she meets this boy ben who is much older than she is so to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father but her lover this is a hysterical movie from beginning to end and i highly suggest it so rent it and enjoy
<START> i tried to be patient and open minded but found myself in a coma like state i wish i would have brought my duck and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i apologize to all of the great actors in this movie maybe it takes a degree from <UNK> to understand the importance of this movie
<START> i would have given this movie a 1 but i laughed so hard so many times that i had to give it a little credit in the off off off off chance the film was supposed to be funny a movie so bad you'll think <UNK> wrote it you'll wish <UNK> had written it dialogue so <UNK> that only it and the <UNK> will survive the coming nuclear holocaust the movie <UNK> its awfulness by <UNK> scenes from the original carrie a really good film into scenes from this one like <UNK> scenes from taxi driver into baby geniuses do not rent it alone as you will not enjoy the experience you will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing worst actress of the <UNK> goes to poor poor amy irving as the stone faced <UNK> <UNK> wooden school <UNK> worst movie of the year so far see also <UNK> road 3
<START> britain and france <UNK> war on germany in 1939 but by then almost all of europe had fallen under the advance of the nazi war machine entering the war britain virtually started from scratch with <UNK> supplies and with an air force that was <UNK> by germany ten to one but the will of the brits was firm <UNK> by their new prime minister winston <UNK> who <UNK> we shall never go under br br on august 8 1940 the battle for britain was on however for the first time since hitler's <UNK> stance to <UNK> the world he hit a wall though <UNK> <UNK> the british royal air force went on the offensive and in the span of twenty eight days in september and october of 1940 german <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to two thousand three hundred <UNK> five lost planes and crew hitler's rage was <UNK> but he had to call a <UNK> time out <UNK> later in the year hitler launched a massive fire bombing of london on christmas day of 1940 when i say that there has never been a disaster movie to rival the real live footage of london in flames during this assault would be an understatement perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the why we fight series would be seeing british citizens emerge from their underground <UNK> following the bombing <UNK> to resume what was left of their life above ground even as you watch there is no way to comprehend the living horror these people must have gone through as the city of london was left in virtual ruin br br yet the nazis were stunned and <UNK> as well everything hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy was now turned on it's head instead of being weak <UNK> and <UNK> like the french the british were not going to give up without a fight and fight they did taking the air battle to germany and <UNK> in kind with attacks on the german <UNK> it was a turning point forcing hitler to <UNK> his <UNK>
<START> night hunter starts in as a young jack cutter chris is unexpectedly handed the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when a fellow vampire hunter sid sid <UNK> betrays his family hands them over to the <UNK> to aid jack on his quest he is given a book that contains the name of every vampire alive or dead <UNK> way you look at it jump to los angeles where the now adult cutter don 'the <UNK> wilson also credited as co producer has but four names left in the book including <UNK> vince <UNK> sophia crawford together they are the last of the american vampires as they all <UNK> in a restaurant cutter crashes the party kills them job done right wrong as king of the vampires bruno <UNK> nicholas guest calls in the last four remaining vampires from around the world the french <UNK> maria ford the asian ron <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> vincent to track cutter down kill him meanwhile <UNK> hooper marcus <UNK> <UNK> cash <UNK> don't have a clue a <UNK> reporter named <UNK> baker <UNK> smith becomes involved in the battle between cutter the <UNK> on which the very fate of earth rests br br directed by rick <UNK> i thought night hunter was quite a fun way to pass 85 odd minutes the script by william c <UNK> mixes martial arts horror with a fair degree of success it moves along at a nice pace is at least never boring thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously the character names that reference other horror film director's actors are a little tacky though some may be surprised at how closely night hunter resembles blade 1998 yet was made a couple of years prior the lone moody long coat wearing vampire hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts the scene set in a nightclub the innocent woman drawn into the world of <UNK> night hunter doesn't really stick to traditional vampire film law for instance <UNK> only <UNK> their <UNK> they can only breed on a <UNK> <UNK> why stakes through the heart <UNK> is no good as the way to kill a vampire in night hunter is to break it's neck i could have done with a bit more horror a bit more blood as it <UNK> more towards the martial arts side of things the dialogue is suitably cheesy the character's are just about likable enough in a silly way br br director <UNK> does his best to ruin the film the actions scenes are ok but lack a certain something for some bizarre reason whenever an action sequence takes place he shakes his camera constantly it's like the camera is placed upon a <UNK> machine full cycle hey rick mate it's not clever or stylish it's irritating annoying the gore is disappointing with a few gory <UNK> wounds a few <UNK> of blood breaking <UNK> <UNK> don't involve much blood unfortunately br br with a budget that probably didn't amount to much night hunter is competently made throughout the acting was bad most of the time what's with 'the <UNK> thing in don 'the <UNK> <UNK> name has he <UNK> changed his name does he sign <UNK> don 'the <UNK> wilson does he get mail addressed to him in that name i think i might do something like this from now on i want to be known as paul 'the killer andrews br br night hunter is one of those crap films that <UNK> it's limitations awfulness to become pure golden entertainment if you like your films fun then night hunter might be for you if your looking for big budget thrills in a similar vein <UNK> <UNK> blood get it then blade it's sequels would probably be a better choice what the hell i liked it so sue me
<START> at times i really when i look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than i have i've just seen it and liked it not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film br br the film needs some patience yes and yes the main character is really annoying but that i'm sure is by intention br br maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music this movie definitely doesn't fit as background noise br br and no good directing doesn't mean having five laughs or explosions a second good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together and while that doesn't work out perfectly at least i think it works quite good br br i liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times the opening scene is really special br br i also liked the acting  <UNK> depardieu is not playing pierre he is acting the role of a pierre who is himself playing a role pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a <UNK> and self righteous idiot a downright <UNK> who by and by <UNK> all the people he claims to protect that even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself br br people are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff no character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone br br and even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen remember that isabelle <UNK> from a war zone and obviously this is a <UNK> for fighters in a civil war most likely <UNK> which was still going on when the film was produced at least that's what is hinted at by the story isabelle tells pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where pierre shows isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> of <UNK> jeff the creator of the <UNK> and <UNK> scratch raised a few <UNK> but it's good to see he made it to the extras of the dvd after all with scratch doug pray who previously <UNK> the <UNK> phenomenon of the <UNK> in hype 1996 made an excellent documentary about the world of the hip hop dj and the evolution of his latest documentary <UNK> 2005 explores contemporary american <UNK> culture after a couple of viewings four years ago my dvd had been gathering dust ever since but recently i watched it again and besides the subject material i was surprised how well shot and edited this documentary actually is an immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads but lots of music old school footage parties break dancing you name it one of the best things about the film is that it mainly <UNK> where the art of is today in 2001 that is without <UNK> the <UNK> of course good stuff br br camera <UNK> 8 10
<START> i've read some about the court scenes these people <UNK> their ignorance this production went to simply amazing <UNK> to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred manners are something few people outside the court ever see while the acting may appear highly stylized it is in fact as close a <UNK> as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations as the director could create the actor's facial expressions are a marvel particularly the <UNK> marquis and the king's mother br br there are of course <UNK> of both greek and <UNK> tragedy in the relationship between the king his parents and his love the <UNK> of the king <UNK> from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of an <UNK> nature this movie would provide much to <UNK> in a college course on the <UNK> br br at the same time it almost rushes along even in the <UNK> scenes heading towards an <UNK> denouement one suspects the involvement of large portions of the <UNK> movements which were quite awesome it makes the lord of the rings battle scenes pale by comparison few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of humans on the field of battle just for <UNK> sake i recall one scene in which at least 30 000 troops can be seen moving across a huge plain the <UNK> for such a shot would have been <UNK> br br i could go on but simply i can't recommend this film highly enough
<START> a young man discovers that life is precious after he is seriously injured in a street racing accident his father is a <UNK> who changes his <UNK> on life and he spends the whole movie sharing his new found love for others in this shocking and heartwarming movie the theme is built around street car racing and it is an excellent movie for people who are into that and movies like 'the fast and the <UNK> this shows how people can overcome their problems and gives the general message about the meaning of life in a new and exciting way
<START> i totally agree that the <UNK> kill what could otherwise be a great show i'll admit that i'd seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and was not clear at all that it was all but when i caught one episode recently it suddenly jumped out at me big time and i lost interest immediately then i noticed the <UNK> at the start before an episode that followed has anyone followed the show closely enough to tell me did they actually make the acting and <UNK> parts more artificial on purpose or did i just not notice before i'm usually pretty good at <UNK> this stuff but the recent episode was so obviously artificial i practically <UNK> over it now i have no interest whatsoever in watching and have given up entirely on it it just doesn't have any real value if it's all scripted and acted and at least lately it seems very poorly scripted and acted the comment above that says who cares if it's all <UNK> i do without visual truth this is just a bunch of you know what happened one time this guy it's info better read in a book
<START> one of my favorites as a child growing up in the ny <UNK> area in the late 60s and early 70s i was often <UNK> the opportunity to visit nyc with my grandfather or father as they <UNK> business there the gritty <UNK> human reality of that city particularly in winter have stayed with me br br this film very <UNK> captures the stark cold matter of fact feel of the nyc winter season while <UNK> exposing the <UNK> of the <UNK> infamous underworld of crime and <UNK> a great <UNK> of a place and a time and a culture br br and the car chase is simply amazing at least on par with the one in <UNK> and <UNK> the chase in the french connection i can watch time and again as the suspension comes <UNK> on that <UNK> fury police <UNK> <UNK> toward the <UNK> bridge in pursuit as it <UNK> into that sharp right <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> into <UNK> traffic the stunt driving <UNK> for that scene did <UNK> and the french connection as well as many other movie chases good acting too and a decent plot line the musical score is edgy and compelling and the cinematography and direction are top notch a great if underrated 1970s cop drama a keeper not out on dvd yet though br br comparable in style and content to the french connection and super fly early 1970's cop dramas set in the bleak nyc winter months
