<START> what happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is just one year after the breakfast club a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in st <UNK> fire who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school <UNK> from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles br br was it the directing or the writing since it was the same person joel <UNK> it must be both but then <UNK> has since given us the phantom of the opera phone booth a time to kill and two batman movies batman and robin and batman forever which range from good to great directing something went wrong on <UNK> because it has no genius whatsoever no comedy worth anything and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life br br example the character wendy a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by <UNK> <UNK> reveals to billy an <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> on his wife and on his girlfriends drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by rob lowe that she is still a virgin billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but wendy is not ready wendy in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this <UNK> of friends later in the story when billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together billy is leaving for new york <UNK> and <UNK> all <UNK> responsibility for his baby daughter he convinces wendy that her virginity would be the perfect going away gift from her to him and wendy who works as a social worker helping broken families seems not to be <UNK> at all by this <UNK> give me a break the one thing she can only give once she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends <UNK> frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment br br many more example exist where there is a complete <UNK> between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue br br i suppose some may say that that was the 80's but i remember it was in the 80's that men began to be held responsible for the children they <UNK> whether in a marriage or out br br i think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right br br as for the technique not the story it was terrible as well it is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense pick up what is on the editing room floor put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better but it still is a horrible movie br br maybe <UNK> has become a better and stronger director since 1986 he must have or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for st <UNK> fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way that is what i really think happened
<START> i've just seen the saint strikes back for the first time and found it quite good this was george <UNK> first appearance as the saint where he <UNK> louis <UNK> br br in this one the saint is sent to san francisco to investigate a shooting at a night club with the help of his <UNK> inspector <UNK> who has come down from new york they help a daughter of a crime boss br br joining sanders in the cast are wendy <UNK> and jonathan hale br br not a bad saint movie worth seeing br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit as the plot takes on quite complex issues using football as <UNK> pad for the <UNK> also was an interesting approach still unfortunately despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture <UNK> between muslim and western culture adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays lesbians it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with br br however this does not mean that the film is directly bad as it's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter but as mentioned above the writers seem to have <UNK> themselves a little too deep this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the <UNK> conflicts by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation br br even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when the ball drops this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy ending nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages one can't help but roll eyes towards the resolution personally i was close to shouting finish already at the screen br br there were some decent acting in the film and the two young female central characters had some good moments so did their parents and other <UNK> characters however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism he didn't even appear very likable but rather self involved despite his good deeds which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained br br i give the film a 4 as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from the script and cast had many good believable characters giving the audience a chance to <UNK> either themselves or others had the let downs not been this disappointing i'd easily give the film a 7 or 8 if you enjoyed this film i'd recommend the film east is east which i think is an as good if not better rendering of cultural conflict as well as being amusing and engaging
<START> i fail to see the appeal of this series which is supposed to be sci fi it's really just let's see what soap <UNK> happens this week and oh the <UNK> are involved through flashbacks br br the <UNK> babe that keeps <UNK> the other guy is pretty lame it's pretty obvious that t a was added to the show every time she pops up i'm <UNK> as to wtf is supposed to be going on and don't even try to <UNK> t me about story <UNK> br br it's a soap opera with some cgi thrown in this is not science fiction aside from the original premise br br this series is not everything it's worked up to be if you like trendy edgy dodgy <UNK> vague editor on crack camera work this show might be for you since <UNK> seem to be raving about this show it's a clear indication that vocal <UNK> opinions have been changed from <UNK> <UNK>
<START> why didn't the producers give that show a chance of all the junk on tv why didn't the producers give six degrees a chance will the series go on video i would love to see how it ends put season one on video and sell it i was a loyal fan of six degrees and waited for it's return i set my <UNK> to tape all of the shows thank god for that i just found out that the show was canceled and i'm heart broken i wish i knew it was going to be canceled why didn't they tell us i thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters the writing was pretty good also steven campbell scott is my all time favorite i am so sorry to see it go
<START> when i started to watch this movie on <UNK> 1 i <UNK> the mtv movies were all bad so i <UNK> expecting much but this movie was really good i liked it a lot and it even had a twist at the end see this movie because it shows that made for tv movies that are good exist
<START> the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names i e jennifer <UNK> are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay br br in a positive note kim <UNK> and pat <UNK> performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid br br jason <UNK>

<START> horror sci fi that is interesting as it is laughable f x pretty good for what you manage to see a made for tv thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them jeffrey <UNK> plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that <UNK> with <UNK> cell research and <UNK> human <UNK> with that of a hammerhead shark the horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine a group of scientists led by william forsythe and hunter <UNK> are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment of course after laughing and <UNK> in awe <UNK> creation by the way is his own son <UNK> with a hammerhead is let loose to hunt down one by one his father's colleagues revenge is not always rewarding also in the cast <UNK> <UNK> g r johnson arthur roberts and <UNK> <UNK>

<START> i just can't believe some of the comments on this show the show is just genius sure it doesn't follow the tried and true but do we as <UNK> always want the same things thrust at us over and over again shouldn't we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while the style is not as realistic as previous scooby doo shows but it's not supposed to be the show it titled shaggy and scooby doo get a clue what part of that title states that the entire beloved cast of other <UNK> would constantly join in the action and nowhere does it say that they'd be solving mysteries and they can't even stand monsters so why would they i'm actually glad that they put some long standing plot points that work into a scooby doo show they still have running jokes clumsy hi <UNK> quick change outfits in chase scenes the standard <UNK> gag and even scooby <UNK> in fact i'm glad that this show is out there because i just love it i'm even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villain br br sure it's ridiculous it's supposed to be sure it's different it's supposed to be it's supposed to make you laugh at the villain and cheer for the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all <UNK> <UNK> no matter what the size you're supposed to get the running <UNK> <UNK> joke the whole thing is just put together so well there isn't a single thing i can think that is wrong with it the writing the acting the animation all top notch the title music is awesome my computer plays get a clue when it boots up and the background music is just gripping
<START> i remembered the title so well to me it was a <UNK> <UNK> movie with olivier and <UNK> leigh in supporting roles and it had vincent <UNK> voice from behind <UNK> well <UNK> <UNK> was great her next signature for me would be <UNK> days at <UNK> the same role but with different <UNK> <UNK> and the same voice as for the <UNK> it was a subtext i like black and white films was everything done in <UNK> times at night it was talky and difficult to <UNK> at times i couldn't tell which was the love interest was it the <UNK> or was it <UNK> leigh and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant <UNK> to recommend that fire ships be sent against the <UNK> apparently it worked for the empire but not for the script this might have been more accurate historically but bette davis had more engaging scripts and i missed daylight
<START> this film deals with two ex football players who are fred <UNK> mack <UNK> and gary busey <UNK> who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds mack <UNK> is approached by his ex wife vanity jennifer <UNK> who works at having sex talk over the <UNK> jennifer is being threatened by one <UNK> who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies mack <UNK> have more time on their hands and often go to miami <UNK> golf <UNK> or hang out in a sports bar where all kinds of city things go on there is lots of punches killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big zero don't waste your time this film cost me only 50 cents and that was too much
<START> i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly it is not even funny any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it in the first half hour rob schneider drinks a <UNK> of <UNK> milk all i could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie don't waste your time or money on this one
<START> only saw this show a few times but will live in my memory br br it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guess br br they say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the <UNK> <UNK> themselves maybe it was just too clever for certain people br br anyhow just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network but alas not over here br br summary ingenious
<START> the basic storyline here is <UNK> kumar is the <UNK> son of a millionaire <UNK> <UNK> who owns a toy industry in <UNK> eyes his son <UNK> can do nothing wrong <UNK> mother <UNK> <UNK> shah warns <UNK> to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late for <UNK> is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live when his son <UNK> and marries <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> readily <UNK> <UNK> but when the happy couple <UNK> and <UNK> come back from a honeymoon <UNK> is pregnant and this forces <UNK> to kick <UNK> out of the house to make him more responsible <UNK> doesn't know his father is suffering from lung cancer and he also doesn't know that his father has kicked him out of the <UNK> to make him more responsible <UNK> cannot bring himself to tall <UNK> that he is about to die with a hungry and pregnant wife it is a race against time so <UNK> does all he can to prove himself to his father and the climax comes when <UNK> gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die br br this movie is absolutely brilliant this is the breakthrough in indian cinema that was needed for the bollywood industry <UNK> directing is almost flawless but which movie doesn't have flaws the best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a <UNK> the song <UNK> is just placed at the right time the scenery is good the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying but overall this is a brilliant movie i advise anybody reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews 9 10
<START> i was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror br br to my disappointment this turned into more of a comedy than a horror the acting dialog and flow of the movie was all very poorly done much of it didn't make sense for example there's a party of about 30 people and they're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds <UNK> i kept thinking maybe this was a parody of another movie like scary movie but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome emphasis on try br br the blood and gore are also poorly done i've seen halloween costumes look more believable than this a guy with his head cut clean off looked clean missing signs bone flesh blood and even the head a strong <UNK> strike with an <UNK> on a corpse should <UNK> itself into something seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an <UNK> br br revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist but <UNK> other parts in the story what was going in the guy's mind to turn out like that if there was going to be a twist you should at least build up to it adding mystery and suspense
<START> this documentary is <UNK> on <UNK> cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart <UNK> claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn't there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation <UNK> they spent 30 <UNK> there not the 90 <UNK> claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray br br seriously do some research learn what really happened don't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
<START> i'd just like to say that i've seen this film twice now and i love it the acting is great and even though it is a similar plot to raise your voice i think that the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing it has some great lessons in it and shows us that we can do anything if we try an incredible film i am sure that this is one i will be watching for a long time to come even though britney spears write the book it is quite a realistic plot maybe not about the falling in love part but the part about being different and struggling but coming out best in the end is very true to real life the only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful do you really think that holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or average i doubt it
<START> although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character this was classic h lots the characters outside of mike <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were true to form and the reunion scenes of <UNK> andre <UNK> and <UNK> kyle <UNK> were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen br br homicide the movie aka life <UNK> is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2 hour episode of the series <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it true to homicide form there were no happy endings such is life that's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows left on television kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike br br i call myself a homicidal maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co workers in a <UNK> mood
<START> this 1996 movie was the first adaptation of jane eyre that i ever watched and when i did so i was appalled by it so much of the novel had been left out and i considered william hurt to be terribly miscast as rochester since then i have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel the three short versions of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and the three mini series of '73 <UNK> and 2006 and i have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse <UNK> br br this is without doubt the most exquisite jane eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned director franco <UNK> <UNK> in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky of lonely rochester standing on a rock and of jane looking out of the window but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life in addition his script merely <UNK> the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes as a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between jane and rochester and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their <UNK> there are a number of short conversations between rochester and jane each of them beautifully staged but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other we know that they are supposed to fall in love but we never see it actually happen the scene in which rochester wants to find out jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in <UNK> form before her after the wounded mason has left the house is completely missing and the farewell scene the most important scene the climax of the novel is reduced to four sentences <UNK> does not make the mistake other <UNK> have made in <UNK> their own poor writing for <UNK> superb lines neither are crucial scenes completely changed and <UNK> but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out what remains is just a glimpse of the novel which does no justice to charlotte <UNK> masterpiece br br the cast is a mixed bag while <UNK> shaw is an excellent mrs reed anna <UNK> young jane is more an ill mannered <UNK> <UNK> than a lonely little girl longing for love the ever reliable joan <UNK> makes a very likable but far too <UNK> mrs <UNK> and one cannot help feeling that <UNK> <UNK> is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain looking hard working grace <UNK> charlotte <UNK> as the grown up heroine however is physically a perfect choice for playing jane eyre looking every bit like 18 thin and <UNK> with <UNK> strong features she comes closest to my inner vision of jane than any other actress in that role and during the first 15 minutes of her screen time i was enchanted by her performance <UNK> manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask but unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of jane's character any further as a result of leaving out so many scenes and <UNK> so much of the dialogues <UNK> portrayal of jane must necessarily remain <UNK> and therefore ultimately <UNK> this is a pity as with a better script charlotte <UNK> might have been as good a jane as zelah clarke in the <UNK> version br br but while it is still obvious that <UNK> is trying to play jane there is no trace whatsoever of rochester in the character that william hurt portrays hurt who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies must have been aware that he was physically and type wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the rochester of the novel his rochester besides being blond and blue eyed is a soft spoken well mannered <UNK> shy and quiet slightly <UNK> and eccentric but basically good natured and mild he is so far from being <UNK> moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous additionally during many moments of the movie <UNK> facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against <UNK> attacks of the sleeping sickness particularly in the <UNK> scene he <UNK> like a patient <UNK> from a general <UNK> and is hardly able to keep his eyes open if you compare his rochester to the strong <UNK> and charming protagonist of the novel simply <UNK> with energy and <UNK> it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in <UNK> performance still he <UNK> me less than the <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> and 2006 versions and i would in general rank this jane eyre higher than these three other ones hurt obviously had the wits to <UNK> that he could not be the rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so whereas george c scott <UNK> <UNK> and toby <UNK> thought they could but failed miserably and i'd rather watch a character other than rochester than a rochester who is badly played and i'd rather watch a jane eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not <UNK> new ones than a version which uses <UNK> dialogues which sound as if they could be <UNK> by a today's couple in a <UNK> <UNK> of course this jane eyre is a failure but at least it is an <UNK> one which is more than one can say of the <UNK> and 2006 adaptations i would therefore not <UNK> anyone from watching this adaptation you will not find jane eyre but at least you will find a beautifully made movie
<START> i knew i was going to see a low budget movie but i expected much more from an alex cox film the acting by the two leading men was terrible especially the white guy the girl should have won an oscar compared to those two this movie was filled with what i guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that i actually understood and made me laugh out loud which is rare without these laugh out loud moments i would have given this film 2 10 what happened to the alex cox who made all the 80s classics br br spoiler br br there were a couple of questions i had after the movie was over why did the mexican guy go to the other guy's house at the beginning what did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him i guess i should have gone to the q a after the movie but i didn't want to get up at <UNK>
<START> the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film it should have read <UNK> prepared to be <UNK> back to the prison of the 3rd <UNK> from the back of your family's church at 8 years old listening to the preacher <UNK> on about god's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your <UNK> br br it starts off well <UNK> building intrigue by <UNK> some real and surreal clues such as <UNK> <UNK> did the cut on my thumb <UNK> so fast ' moment it then slowly <UNK> into a christian <UNK> <UNK> its plot completely in a wash of <UNK> induced <UNK> i believe i counted the use of the word <UNK> about <UNK> times in a five minute span near the end after the <UNK> i tried to twist the context of the word to its <UNK> <UNK> sadly this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say <UNK> <UNK> to me as it became totally zany indeed even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom almost to the point of ending up on the floor br br for all the <UNK> christians who <UNK> this film 8 10 stars i suggest sticking with your <UNK> <UNK> safety standards like circle square the ten <UNK> anything from <UNK> jesus christ superstar and the like stay away from more <UNK> challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp the god who wasn't there what would jesus buy or the soon to be released <UNK> br br maybe robert <UNK> book is better
<START> there are some good things about the movie the music and cinematography is great alex wilson is hot and gives a great performance ryan bauer is also hot the production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie <UNK> vincent sean and a lot of the boys in the movie that don't speak are cute too why isn't the actress who plays amy listed in the credits brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance as <UNK> pink br br the worse thing about the movie is probably the star james <UNK> he can't act he's also very <UNK> not nice to look at at all his arms are like spaghetti it's disgusting they have no muscle tone at all it's no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it no one else would cast him in anything br br james <UNK> is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay they should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what's best for the movie then again maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft core porn definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons plus anyone who does porn is <UNK> in hollywood br br the most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a <UNK> skinned <UNK> as <UNK> mother <UNK> fisher does not seem like an actress at all all in all this movie is soft core porn and is no better than something you would see on <UNK> i think even alex wilson probably the best thing about this movie is embarrassed by it and doesn't want to be associated with it there is no photo on his imdb page and nothing else listed so alex wilson is probably a <UNK> stage name plus i ran into him in west hollywood one time recently and when i mentioned this movie he just turned around and walked away i understand if i had worked on this movie i would be embarrassed and wouldn't want to be associated with it either
<START> i am not from america and i know what <UNK> <UNK> is when a show came out of that name i was thrilled to see some cool <UNK> sexual moments from the program but what i got was a real sucking stupidity i was <UNK> by its title name it has no adult <UNK> no nudity not even vulgar dialogues broad casted threw hallmark channel and i think they edited mute out such <UNK> to make it neat br br a show which gives a picture of current american western family state overweight <UNK> peoples <UNK> teenagers and their sucking family goings in each episode two wives two mothers more correctly were chosen to live in each others home and re changes each others family routine with their new own rule sometimes its turns out to be good or more <UNK> bad on the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days it's the sucking portion of the program were each <UNK> fights for their rights i was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff i mean who make this program more than that who gave the name wife <UNK> its better to be called as mother <UNK> all in all it <UNK> all the great things the real wife <UNK> stands for br br wife <UNK> average sucking reality show
<START> i really enjoyed this movie most of the reviews have been bad but most critics think a movie should be like an idea drama this movie has a little bit of drama but the rest is just clean fun and very entertaining forget about julia roberts being a pretty woman emma roberts is a beautiful young lady and there is more to her than just that emma was so much fun to watch in the role of nancy drew it is good to see a new face i believe she will go far br br nancy drew may not be based upon the books but the story is still good there is also a good blend of other character actors and supporting actors like pat <UNK> barry <UNK> rachel leigh cook and chris <UNK> not credited i'm surprised disney did not release this movie some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex violence and <UNK> this is a good family film which is rare in this day in time so take your family see this movie and judge for your self how good it is i can't wait for the sequel
<START> there was some <UNK> from my part about what this movie had to offer for starters the casting didn't seem right <UNK> sutherland had already done very well in 24 and the preview didn't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience eva longoria appeared out of place and the rest didn't seem very interesting br br when the film finally ended i was not completely <UNK> for i had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development we have seen <UNK> of this type before and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers as an audience we don't want to sit through the same old story again we want to see something different be thrilled and entertained br br there is nothing wrong with the casting from kim <UNK> delicious first lady she carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable michael douglas has been and done that before unfortunately the president is much of a non <UNK> to even care about his fate sutherland <UNK> his 24 tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen and eva does a passable job as the newcomer br br don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics north by <UNK> and the fugitive come to mind leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be it's o k
<START> i'm not sure what i just couldn't laugh at it i had an open mind i didn't want to be a tight ss about it but i seriously just couldn't laugh at this film it was just not funny to me some parts it seemed like ben stiller and jack black tried too hard just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy some movies just shouldn't be made this is one of them because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid i know i know it's a comedy sort of at least but i was just not impressed i'm sorry but i cannot give this anything lower than a two and that's all i'm giving br br 2 10
<START> finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie which not only tells a story but actually tells the real story i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter <UNK> you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is it is not a movie to attract new fans but a movie to tell the real tale some things could have been better but when you cannot forget the awful movie from <UNK> then is this a magnificent movie so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story
<START> a <UNK> american family <UNK> in the west discover a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs and a deadly presence is stalking them i generally love mystery horror films like this cube spielberg's duel and the birds are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more apparently disappearance writer director walter <UNK> was trying to make just that kind of film and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer i personally think he got about half way there then the film just sunk br br the actors are all kind of just ho hum their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways is anyone else absolutely sick of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds at least give them some kind of justification for doing so br br as far as made for tv films go it's an above average fair for sure director <UNK> should be <UNK> for really <UNK> the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking there's a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely <UNK> to glass for as far as the eye could see i wonder if that was <UNK> br br no gore to speak of and the <UNK> what ever the hell it is that's after these <UNK> never shown not to mention that we are never even given a real clue as to what they are mutants aliens ghosts or ancient evil indian <UNK> that really <UNK> it down for us or where the come from br br there are lots of clichés here too why is it that towns folk in these kinds of films are always really really dumb why is there always an old guy everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct why why why how <UNK> a new scenario folks br br disappearance tries to be different and intelligent but ultimately fails in that in many ways it's too familiar to us fans of direct to video horror fodder hey i've seen much worse films and disappearance ain't bad it's just <UNK> average br br 4 10
<START> based on the korean legend unknown creatures will return and <UNK> the planet reporter ethan <UNK> is called in to investigate the matter and he arrives at the conclusion that a girl stricken with a mysterious illness named sarah is suppose to help him the <UNK> makes its way to los angeles <UNK> havoc and destruction with the entire city under arms will ethan and sarah make it in time to save the people of los angeles written by anonymous i think he should have included the following br br this is the worst movie i have ever seen the best actor in the whole thing was the cg dragon and overall it s u c k ed i am p i s s ed at not only with the people who made it but myself for watching save yourself the time read a book or something maybe a little dr seuss that should be more stimulating br br no wonder the guy is anonymous sorry for the format this site has a lot of rules this is the only way i could get this out without adding more
<START> i was in the film too but i don't know if they actually put this scene in on the way back from a school trip in 2005 we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were doing the film and we were asked the whole of us to run in and shout go <UNK> we were all around 10 years old could anyone who has seen the film tell me if that part was actually kept in the film it would be great to know i remember i thought the film had never come out because it was another 2 and a half years before it was released all of your comments seem to be good so i'm guessing it has been quite a successful film i might buy it but first i would like to know if i'm in it d thank you
<START> what a crappy movie the worst of the worst this movie is as entertaining as a dead slug no talent what so ever actors stupid plot who wrote this script was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what my friends younger brother is in the 6 <UNK> grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur movie for their school project which <UNK> this geeky movie this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life there is just no excuse for this flick
<START> 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter is my opinion is an absolute abc classic i'm not sure i haven't seen every episode but i still enjoyed it it's hard to say which episode was my favorite however i think it was always funny when a <UNK> occurred i always laughed at that despite the fact that james garner and david spade were good i liked the show more when john ritter was the leading man if you ask me his sudden passing was very tragic everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion i hope some network brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see
<START> in 1990 brad pitt and <UNK> lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in kalifornia i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film br br kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to <UNK> obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers in fact he's got a most unusual odyssey planned he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers but he and forbes are flat broke br br fate <UNK> in more ways than financial with the arrival of brad pitt and juliette lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip it turns out pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own <UNK> into the mind of someone who is fascinated with <UNK> br br kalifornia is not the type of film i usually go for but in fact the acting ability and charisma of brad pitt make it work to a large degree pitt is the walking definition of an <UNK> gothic <UNK> from deliverance but better than he is is juliette lewis who once again is playing these low self <UNK> types which she seems to do well watch her scene with forbes as she does her hair and lewis describes her sad and pathetic life <UNK> dialog and <UNK> reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country br br for those who like their slasher flicks they don't come better than kalifornia
<START> i absolutely love this movie and would really like to have it someday it's just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a <UNK> <UNK> i loved it and would like to see it again i don't remember too much about it but that a native american boy lives in a nice village with his family and i don't remember what happens but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone his sister packs him some food and he goes while he's out there some other indian boys come running out and put some <UNK> on him and he turns into an eagle the legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a <UNK> <UNK> it is the boy i was always fascinated with legends particularly native american legends and i would love to see this released someday to a dvd please release it <UNK> concerned
<START> revenge on us the viewing public perhaps i sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title but <UNK> never <UNK> his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends i was left wondering where the rest of the movie was if a movie is called revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film i had a choice of seeing this or black rain at the cinema thankfully i saw the other brothers movie at the cinema instead i caught up with this turkey on video there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune listen to the cd dont watch this its awful 1 out of 10
<START> the wife and i saw a preview of this movie while watching another dvd and thought jon <UNK> diane keaton jeff daniels and eli <UNK> it's gotta be better than summer reruns so i ordered it from local library well any episode of lawrence <UNK> would bring more laughs than <UNK> boy i actually felt sorry for the actors for having to read the script in the <UNK> of their own homes and i couldn't imagine what it must have been like for them to have to actually say their lines in front of a camera perhaps at least maybe next time they're offered a movie of this sort they'll just say no ' a one anna two
<START> i saw this at a screening last night too i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion br br i won't bother <UNK> the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better but i will say that adam <UNK> performance was really refreshing and real he was funny and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies don cheadle was believable as always br br this movie isn't funny like <UNK> or billy madison but it has a good pace about it i'd say 90 of the audience laughed for most of the film <UNK> through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of <UNK> it all together br br i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves
<START> this movie features a gorgeous brunette named <UNK> petty she has stunning green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the last scene she is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive she may not have a future as an actress because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers br br the movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it it is not a good horror film or a good fake <UNK> report or remotely well done there is no skill apparent in it's production it is like a bad student film the story's horrific elements do not make you sick it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick i would give this movie zero stars if i could
<START> i rented this shortly after renting ben <UNK> <UNK> and thought it would interesting to compare them before i go further it seems only fair that i point out the following so a reader can see if i'm <UNK> or not i'm trying to be objective for the record br br i tend to enjoy <UNK> hbo show now and then though i rarely think he's the source of the humor i don't really care for his stand up either but he makes some good points on the show now and again and i liked politically incorrect though he was still fairly politically correct which i <UNK> a negative because the very term sounds <UNK> or at least fascist as for my religious views i'll say for <UNK> sake that i'm a non <UNK> christian with some views that are <UNK> and some that are <UNK> mixed in br br that being said this a bad documentary for reasons that haven't been touched on yet by many reviewers though the ones mentioned are valid too the reason it's not convincing isn't just that he <UNK> the main point without letting others talk and his point <UNK> down to nothing logical either it's just come on really which isn't a point just a question try david <UNK> if you want a decent argument the reason this isn't convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter i saw this about 2 months ago and i only recall him talking to one person whose <UNK> as a professional were mentioned if he wasn't a <UNK> there are probably hundreds of scientists or at least <UNK> with masters or <UNK> willing to do a bit of verbal <UNK> particularly in the fields of history <UNK> or a host of others br br if one <UNK> this to ben <UNK> <UNK> no intelligence allowed he'll find that <UNK> interviews about 30 <UNK> <UNK> professionals <UNK> etc he does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds he also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education <UNK> could easily have pointed out <UNK> committed by <UNK> rules throughout centuries or <UNK> from this instead he <UNK> refers to the 20th <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as evidence of why <UNK> needs more <UNK> political power it's in the bonus features where he's standing in front of the anne frank house i think this is a true <UNK> head trip he blames christianity in particular on many pointless deaths which has had its share though far smaller than most without even including a basic view of the evidence perhaps this is because that argument is <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> miserable record of the 20th century alone br br another glaring weakness is his <UNK> to talk to anyone that would be considered a <UNK> or average <UNK> he picks out the weakest <UNK> of the herd how difficult is that how does proving the existence of exceptions move toward <UNK> the general rule it does not wow so people in <UNK> think outside of the norm how <UNK> to know this great work <UNK> again it would be fairly easy to interview someone like laurence vance and include his work on <UNK> the idea of patriotic duty that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in br br beyond all that he's just not that funny here some of the clips that are <UNK> in clever out of context <UNK> ways might garner a laugh but mostly work to illustrate how a real <UNK> argument from <UNK> will not be <UNK> much less convincing he spends most of his time bashing christians <UNK> inaccuracies and <UNK> <UNK> groups that he doesn't allow to really answer his questions br br for the record there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves he touches on almost none of these i get the feeling that i could've <UNK> much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed but the whole thing <UNK> of deck <UNK> in terms of what is included and what was edited out
<START> i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time the <UNK> flying <UNK> was <UNK> beyond <UNK> especially when landing yet the specially effects when the <UNK> attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when <UNK> adams suggested <UNK> should dress more <UNK> and as an engineer was amazed by the imagination used for the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> up by the props department all in all an entertaining hour and a half my first time seeing walter <UNK> and a chance to see leslie <UNK> as a <UNK> man
<START> this was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that i shall never tire of watching many many times the casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters there are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format as for <UNK> <UNK> she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars i always make a point to see <UNK> <UNK> in all her performances she is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life i can only be grateful when i see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters good scripts and good acting the movie public needs heroes not <UNK> <UNK> who lack <UNK> and talent how wonderful to see old favorites like leslie caron olympia dukakis and <UNK> <UNK> i would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment i <UNK> the writer director producer and all those who did such a fine job
<START> while the original <UNK> the intellect this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities instead of intricate plot twists this so called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to <UNK> it further with each bizarre development worst of all replacing the original <UNK> dialog is an <UNK> <UNK> full of unnecessary four letter words leaving behind a stark but uninteresting taste br br there was promise <UNK> promise the <UNK> of michael caine pulling off a patty duke like <UNK> to sullivan <UNK> is admittedly intriguing unfortunately this brilliant and respected actor only <UNK> his reputation first by accepting the role in this horribly re scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to jude <UNK> amateurish overacting br br if you haven't seen the classic original overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks hunt it down watch it and just enjoy a story and a half as for the remake pass on this insult to the original
<START> more tv movies ought to be made like this one i saw it way back in <UNK> when it was first on tv helen hunt and steven <UNK> were both terrific giving very gritty and realistic performances <UNK> was especially good turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child <UNK> killer this film really <UNK> my respect for hunt as an actress the director also directed <UNK> which was somehow both formulaic and exciting but the direction in both of these works has the same stark simple realism that is so appealing if you like tv movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting see it if you can the side story about hunt and <UNK> affair is also appealing without <UNK> from the main story
<START> here's a gritty get the bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough denzel washington he's three personalities here a down and out low key now drunk former <UNK> then a loving father type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge br br the story is about washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little american girl living in mexico where <UNK> of children occur regularly at least according to the movie he becomes attached to the kid played <UNK> by the child actress of our day <UNK> fanning when fanning is kidnapped in front of him washington goes after the men responsible and <UNK> no one beware this film is not for the <UNK> br br this is stylish film making which is good and bad i liked it but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera work is one that could give you a headache i thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view but it's the shaky camera not for all tastes br br besides the two stars there is the always interesting christopher walken in an <UNK> low key role and a number of other fine actors br br the film <UNK> to the base emotions in all of us but it works
<START> this is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie lynch stuff rather it's for those who either appreciate a good story or have grown tired of the run of the mill stuff with overt <UNK> and oprah ish this is such a wonderful movie you must see it <UNK> <UNK> she is right for once br br the story unfolds <UNK> and we are taken along a journey that i believe most of us will come to recognize at some time a compassionate <UNK> journey where we make <UNK> <UNK> our past when approaching <UNK> inevitable demise br br acting is without faults cinematography likewise occasionally quite brilliant and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details <UNK> the story br br a warm movie not <UNK> sentimental
<START> i never heard of the book nor care to read it but the movie i will probably see many times br br this film is unforgettable with perhaps the <UNK> imagery i have ever seen in a movie it was as if i was looking at paintings many times which i think was the idea br br terrific movie story actors and cinematography full of profound emotions from every angle although i am not particularly fond of romance movies i loved this and was deeply moved by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to her father toward the end br br mr <UNK> deserved an award for his performance and close was never better br br
<START> i saw this film at the <UNK> festival as did presumably all the other voters the director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project which i think explains the above average reception and mark it got it's most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite round the twist but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature the movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you're trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all un member states as i can't think of another <UNK> movie but overall it was generic poorly acted albeit by an amateur cast and prey to the <UNK> mentality the moral of the story seemed to be that native <UNK> will try and screw each other over but as long as there is an essentially decent white <UNK> to step in all problems can be solved by leaving the island
<START> i had the opportunity to see this film debut at the <UNK> film festival in which it won an award for best picture this film is brilliantly done with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble my favorite performances were from <UNK> <UNK> justin lane and adam jones also there are some great effects with <UNK> and <UNK> that i was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget the writer director adam jones who i believe also won an award for his writing does an excellent job with direction the audience loved this movie cross eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie definitely a must see
<START> i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since br br the plot has been well discussed so no need in going over it again the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings americans especially aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around i know i didn't br br this movie is funny touching sad all at the same time when ray <UNK> the <UNK> at his daughter's wedding it's cringe inducing when karen calls tony brian as he attempts to kiss her it's heartbreaking when <UNK> is finally <UNK> by the woman in black it's too funny for words br br and the music it's as good as any movie soundtrack i've heard in years i was dancing in the living room to all over the world br br every performance is absolutely perfect bill <UNK> has been <UNK> <UNK> for his portrayal of ray a man who has had one too many bad <UNK> stephen rea is perfect as tony the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years he has an appealing <UNK> look that makes women want to hug him but all the actors are equally brilliant br br ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it it's a gem
<START> to be honest i didn't like executive decision which was obvious the <UNK> very much but compared to this piece of crap it looks like a masterpiece of art br br not only that the people moving in the film the term actors would be an insult for all other actors should attend more acting classes the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from <UNK> it is so ridiculous that on a <UNK> only 3 flight <UNK> are aboard but this is only the tip of the iceberg the film is full of <UNK> e g use sleeping gas then don't use it then use it anyway which dropped my rating finally to the bottom br br you can have more fun in <UNK> you <UNK> <UNK> or in <UNK> a hole in your <UNK> and fill it with milk
<START> well i just gave away 95 minutes and <UNK> seconds that i'll never get back on this piece of trash i heard someone online describe this movie's villains as <UNK> cannibals and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent wrong the descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline these villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch this movie isn't so controversial i've seen this level of gore in many films this movie plain sucks synopsis a blonde who thinks she's real hot but she isn't her admirer and her <UNK> friend no i don't remember their names go into the woods their car breaks down they are warned to leave by a man named mark the blonde gets <UNK> hysterical and the next morning they can't find the <UNK> friend admirer <UNK> his foot <UNK> don't worry he is much more upset when his car won't start than when he gets <UNK> by nails after a <UNK> of <UNK> the blond leaves to find help events ensue that i cannot remember during this and throughout the movie we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals even though all they are seen eating is intestines which would <UNK> be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard <UNK> to work up tears then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and <UNK> she can out think them mark the man who warned them to leave has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family then there is some shooting they leave the house the shooting continues then a random guy shows up and says he's been watching them before he is shot we are shown an acid trip inspired scene of more killing the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them there's more killing the admirer <UNK> his love for the blonde then a mysterious hand covers the camera what does that imply i don't know hopefully not a sequel
<START> i went and saw rivers and <UNK> again today it's the second time in two days and yes i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and <UNK> works this morning when i threw the <UNK> i received <UNK> the abysmal water goldsworthy has an <UNK> with water hence the title i received the <UNK> line changing which moved to 7 the army to blake art was a war anyway i knew i had to see the film again br br i read one of the few reviews <UNK> online from the sf <UNK> the critic loved the film but said <UNK> comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film he'd rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack so i was aware of that as i watched this second time br br yesterday i thought that i'd vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say could i enjoy the film without his comments what he is doing what he is saying goes way beyond art his understanding of water time stone change and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of <UNK> <UNK> or some <UNK> some of his work words are <UNK> like his knowledge br br anyway the film is only apparently being shown here in the bay area be a trend <UNK> go to your local cinema and tell them no insist that they have to book a film you've heard about from the <UNK> lands it's called rivers and <UNK> br br
<START> this could be one of the worse movies i've ever seen i don't see how could this ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller its more like a <UNK> drama the scary music is excellent but since there weren't any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs the movie had so much potential they had beautiful cinematography <UNK> and interesting characters but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them they would <UNK> peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different
<START> another review <UNK> this <UNK> to a cross between monty python and twin peaks also <UNK> yet another review <UNK> on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non <UNK> and black comedy also well worth consideration br br watch the whole thing all three series at the end all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel the detail and <UNK> are <UNK> thoroughly post modern <UNK> funny and <UNK> tragic not for kids not for those with thin <UNK> or who lack <UNK> thought provoking at once literal <UNK> and surreal in disturbing ways the <UNK> comedy i can recall br br and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see
<START> i agree with all the <UNK> i went through a box of <UNK> watching this film it had a gritty authenticity and <UNK> true in every way br br the question i'm about to raise represents a current sensibility regarding the treatment of animals i had a very difficult time with the beginning slaughter of sheep and <UNK> and the dying deer with its <UNK> neck and <UNK> blood as its life <UNK> away was hideous br br this is the age of no animals were hurt in the production of this move <UNK> was made in the late 70's before the <UNK> of computer <UNK> was it possible to fake these animal deaths or were these animals slaughtered for art
<START> there are some things i will never understand why underwear comes in packs of <UNK> when clearly thats not enough is an example similarly i will never understand this film and that is brilliant if you approach this film expecting an actual movie you might as well be approaching satan expecting a hug although that may well be possible if you <UNK> this film's satanic figures take pitch for instance the most <UNK> camp <UNK> portrayal of a devil since freddy <UNK> and wayne sleep joined forces to create a ten foot satan costume from red body paint and <UNK> covered with <UNK> however it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever seriously this is no understatement the same can be applied to every other character bar the little girl who acts so <UNK> innocent she's probably <UNK> for some serious crime she's part of then again if <UNK> inter space <UNK> station is real there is no chance she could have avoided him this long put simply if you haven't seen this movie you cannot consider yourself a serious buff the <UNK> funny characterisation acting concept and almost under the radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date if you're after pure laughter that is
<START> i strongly disagree with <UNK> regarding jim <UNK> talent i happen to like belushi very much admittedly i was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because i was such a huge fan of his late brother john but jim has an on screen charm that has gotten him very far and he has developed it well over the years br br curly sue is one of his earlier films his weight is a <UNK> ain't that true for most of us and i like the film yes it is touching and heartwarming so if you're into car chases explosions and gratuitous sex then you might want to pass on this one it is a warm film of three lost soles who find each other don't get me wrong i am all for the three aforementioned keys to a successful film but i also like a nice solid tale like this one br br and although belushi and kelly lynch deliver excellent performances the real star of this film is <UNK> porter who is absolutely adorable br br i don't know what happened to her career but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball agent parents herself should be shot you couldn't ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this film and yet nothing of note has been heard from her since br br another sad hollywood story
<START> modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake the money pit older viewers today watch it with <UNK> of nostalgia cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas were all <UNK> in an easier less complicated era or was it time of course has a way of <UNK> perspectives and with so many films today <UNK> <UNK> with social and political commentary there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older seemingly less provocative films in mr blandings builds his dream house there may therefore be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 there is political commentary however subtle finding a house in the late 40s was a truly <UNK> experience only lightly <UNK> by the coming of <UNK> and the like politics in the movie the blandings children always seem to be talking about <UNK> ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism in real life too myrna loy was a <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and a feminist melvyn douglas was no less a <UNK> <UNK> he was married to <UNK> helen <UNK> douglas whom young richard <UNK> accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her jason <UNK> sr has a small role in the film but his political <UNK> was no less noticeable more importantly his son jason <UNK> jr would be for many years a very active liberal <UNK> almost the odd fellow out was cary grant whose <UNK> <UNK> reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already <UNK> but this was 1948 communism was a real perceived threat and the <UNK> was just around the corner it would be another decade before political <UNK> would <UNK> in mainstream films and then not so subtly
<START> the tv guide calls this movie a mystery what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant <UNK> cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents this is bollywood at its best worst i honestly cannot tell the difference <UNK> sweet <UNK> clichés on every level story line situations dialog music and choreography to put it <UNK> you must be a <UNK> to enjoy it i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity but there were times when i had to walk away from it because i could not take it any more the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses br br
<START> it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years for me the main <UNK> the uneven script br br while some of it is witty and hip quite a bit of it is dull unfunny and lifeless many of the gags just sit there lacking spark and energy br br of the cast mae west and rachel welch come over well roger <UNK> in the role of rusty shines too bad he didn't make more films but for my money there's just too much of john huston and poor rex reed isn't hardly given a fighting chance his character seems <UNK> to <UNK> around on the <UNK> wondering what he's doing in this film br br the low user rating should give an idea as to the <UNK> opinion of this piece <UNK> original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted not even the <UNK> film clips did much all in all a rather sub par effort and it's not likely to get much better with time
<START> the bat people is a proud resident of the imdb bottom 100 every once and a while the movie suddenly <UNK> from the infamous list depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars but it always <UNK> returns sooner or later and why because unlike the majority of crap in that list the bat people is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz this nearly isn't the worst film ever made since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and <UNK> but it's still <UNK> difficult to sit through the whole thing the script is incredibly boring with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film other than a sensible screenplay the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make up effects  although courtesy of a young stan winston  are <UNK> inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film the film's title is inaccurate as people refers to a number in <UNK> whereas the story actually just revolves on one bat person much more than bruce wayne the real batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine bat cave and a bat mobile a stolen <UNK> the plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon weekend exploring <UNK> they wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the <UNK> vicious attack worried that he might be infected with <UNK> he <UNK> an intense treatment at the local hospital but still this doesn't prevent him from slowly <UNK> into a <UNK> bat creature he kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to <UNK> reactions to the <UNK> treatment sure honey the script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come john always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat <UNK> so basically the bat people is a variation on the good old werewolf theme but obviously not a very interesting one the concept showed a lot of potential but somehow the sub plots center on whiny <UNK> and perverted <UNK> instead of on ghastly monsters some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive the <UNK> song playing during the credits is strangely catchy there's a nice bit of gore during the climax finally and main actress <UNK> <UNK> is ravishing to look at though not to listen to this truly bad and boring film's current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80 and personally i hope it sticks somewhere in that region the list simply wouldn't feel and traditional without the bat people
<START> this is one of the worse cases of film drivel i have seen in a long while it is so awful that i am not sure where to begin or even if it is worth it the plot is the real problem and i feel sorry for <UNK> as he puts in a decent performance for his part but that plot oh dear oh dear i particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top whilst the helicopter is on the way a climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes i could go on but it isn't worth it apart from the grim opening which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of the rest is drivel sorry folks but this is about as bad as film making gets
<START> simply not the quality i expected from morris love <UNK> eye and blue jam this is very much like a not so bad student film what concerns me in all this is why did it win a <UNK> morris makes fun of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in much of his work nathan <UNK> and yet with this piece is <UNK> down the backs of the talented and telling us its <UNK> br br i just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle the humanity of terrorism four lions that he isn't going to <UNK> that up wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this <UNK> and heavily <UNK> <UNK>
<START> whenever i make up a list of the absolute worst movies i've ever seen this movie is always on it it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever it took an act of will to sit through the whole thing and i would sooner <UNK> my own blood than have to sit through it again br br what's wrong with it let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater br br i went to a midnight show on a saturday night i the only ones in the theater were myself and a bunch of loud <UNK> rather <UNK> teenagers sitting somewhere behind me they were obviously out having a good time on a saturday night and had come to this comedy for some laughs before the movie starts during the previews they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time it was borderline annoying had they continued their <UNK> enthusiasm into the actual movie i <UNK> said something but i was feeling <UNK> and <UNK> of their spirited fun so i let it go and they did settle down once the movie started br br why am i telling you all this because you can judge this alleged comedy by the effect it had not just on myself but on this <UNK> bunch br br during the entire run of the film not one person in the theater laughed not once not myself not the <UNK> kids absolute silence aside from the soundtrack and when the film was over and the lights came on we all all of us slowly <UNK> out of the theater in slow somber absolute silence it could've been a funeral br br this was the effect that this comedy produced not laughter not enjoyment but absolute depression it was a depressing depressing movie and not the <UNK> bit funny preachy self indulgent depressing but not funny br br i consider mel <UNK> blazing <UNK> to be on the short list for funniest movie ever it still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the least funny movie ever br br in short if you're feeling too happy give this movie a <UNK> otherwise don't say i didn't warn you
<START> cillian murphy and rachel mcadams star in this action thriller written and directed by the master of suspense wes craven himself the whole movie starts with some trouble at the <UNK> atlantic a hotel in miami the problem is all fixed by lisa <UNK> the manager of the hotel then she goes to the airport and that's where all of the trouble begins she meets jackson <UNK> who doesn't like to be called jack because of the name jack the <UNK> if you know you him and i mean then they board the plane and crazy enough <UNK> and <UNK> sit next to each other for the next half hour lisa is <UNK> tormented and terrified by <UNK> i won't give anything away then we move on to where jack is chasing lisa in the airport then lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay and <UNK> enough <UNK> is already there there is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene in total about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the end br br not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it like i said i will not give anything away because it's so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing frightening and the acting from every single character in the movie even the ones with no lines at all were all pitch perfect it was incredible everything was awesome in this movie the acting the music the effects the make up the directing the editing the writing everything was wonderful wes craven is definitely the master of suspense red eye is definitely a must see and is definitely worth spending your money on you could watch this movie over and over and over again and it would never ever get boring br br red eye i have to say is better than 10 out of 10 stars br br original mpaa rating pg 13 some intense sequences of violence and language br br my mpaa rating pg 13 some very intense sequences of violence and language br br my canadian rating <UNK> violence frightening scenes disturbing content
<START> grand canyon is a very strange bird it's a completely unique urban piece where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much br br it's central theme seems to be the inherent <UNK> life holds for people of every race background and station but to <UNK> that the theme of the film would be to horribly <UNK> its scope similarly to <UNK> it in a particular genre is <UNK> br br the film has volumes to say though likely different volumes for every viewer and says it all in such a non preachy way from so many angles that in the end i can't even define its central message for myself br br nevertheless it does it's business with such laser <UNK> every prop line of dialog and bar of background music <UNK> to it's <UNK> mood and powerful message that i'm pleasantly surprised and come away very thoughtful after every viewing still it doesn't feel at all <UNK> a <UNK> film with a great cast and everything working
<START> <UNK> <UNK> parade 1933 released 9 30 1933 viewed 5 5 <UNK> br br the ice cream <UNK> is invented in new york br br kevin after a long and busy break we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros this time it's the ultra fast paced <UNK> parade starring james cagney as <UNK> stage producer <UNK> kent i am 100 certain that cagney was <UNK> berkeley with his performance of the <UNK> kent who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute joan blondell is also excellent as the acid <UNK> secretary turned love interest the ruby keeler dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable one thing that <UNK> me was <UNK> performances themselves which seemed far too <UNK> and complex to be performed on any stage let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards obviously busby doesn't let a little thing like story <UNK> him from putting together the most over the top musical numbers he can possibly <UNK> i liked nearly all of this movie until the end with the shamelessly offensive number shanghai <UNK> which as one can guess is about as stomach turning as <UNK> <UNK> performances come br br doug six movies in three months got to be a new record <UNK> <UNK> warner bros ' musical trilogy of 1933 <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of 1933 ' i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row i wonder if james cagney was <UNK> busby berkeley while he was playing <UNK> kent in this movie or if that the role as written was inspired by busby i hope it was it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday <UNK> the way <UNK> does the funny thing about cagney was that he didn't really look like a leading man in the traditional sense he was <UNK> square headed and talked with an odd new york accent but the guy was quite versatile going from the <UNK> gangsters that made him so famous to the fast talking producer types we see here and he could dance basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor the rest of the cast has some familiar faces joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as <UNK> loyal and <UNK> secretary dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple but seem to get less screen time than before billy <UNK> pops up again as the mischievous <UNK> the movie is typical of the more <UNK> and adult oriented musicals of the pre code era as opposed to those of the 50's and 60's that were more family oriented and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year the shanghai <UNK> number not <UNK> with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese br br last film dinner at eight 1933 next film i'm no angel 1933
<START> while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind this is still a stunning film that <UNK> the science fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen it <UNK> the global chaos of wwii but <UNK> on the premise by having the conflict last 30 years and then tells the epic tale of man's struggle out from under the <UNK> and into the <UNK> of space the acting seems wooden and strangely <UNK> but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie's release and which still impress today this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre
<START> i saw this little <UNK> gem two days after seeing <UNK> <UNK> make no mistake about it <UNK> is a roller coaster ride be it american or european <UNK> des <UNK> or as it is being called in the u s <UNK> <UNK> is a tale of a young 15 year old girl played by pauline <UNK> who at times resembles a young scarlett johansson acts the cool <UNK> girl who wants to be on the school swim team just to be close to another attractive girl adele <UNK> it's more than obvious that marie is more than attracted to floriane <UNK> among all of this is <UNK> rather <UNK> unattractive friend anne who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age along the way we are shown the usual array of teen <UNK> broken hearts shop <UNK> alcohol and or drug use casual sex etc this is a quiet little film that takes time to work it's way into your system michael bay fans take note the pacing here is s l o w so steer clear but if you have no problem with this water <UNK> is a <UNK> no rating here but would pull down a hard r due to language nudity adult situations
<START> before <UNK> sky i saw diane <UNK> tender performance in this otherwise <UNK> of a movie <UNK> are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults each of those that return seem to be looking for something they lost which makes it so realistic maybe you had to be a <UNK> to really get it but in the words of one character <UNK> all her clothes were wet this is so camp from the practical jokes and fighting over boyfriends to the scary lunch lady and the early morning bell it's <UNK> once exciting activities now seem mundane a terrific ensemble cast makes the best of one two dimensional roles and makes them believable bill paxton diane elizabeth mrs brad <UNK> probably when he first fell for her the beautiful scenery bright colors comical music including variations of hello <UNK> and a comic acting turn by noted director sam <UNK> makes this a movie you can pull out again and again like looking up an old friend
<START> if you've read the original novel as i did you will probably hate this thing br br the film version of absolute <UNK> is a nightmarish <UNK> of 1980s <UNK> attempting to create a period piece set in the late 1950s and failing to re create or even pay homage to that period the us monstrosity of dirty dancing does similar to 1963 except that film proved <UNK> successful despite having equally amateurish screen writing in addition to suffering from looking too 1980s the characters have been changed re arranged and <UNK> to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and of course their names <UNK> is transformed from the <UNK> <UNK> ex girlfriend and <UNK> <UNK> who willingly plans to marry a <UNK> old queen for money at her own <UNK> in the first few pages into a hapless and naive eve <UNK> <UNK> by fame and <UNK> exploited and somehow <UNK> into a <UNK> marriage by her boss who surprisingly wasn't given a van dyke and <UNK> <UNK> she and the narrator re named colin after the <UNK> author colin <UNK> for the film are also in a relationship br br big <UNK> character a lesbian seemingly butch yet <UNK> like in her mid <UNK> who acts as <UNK> to a <UNK> of young and bubble headed lesbians and one of the <UNK> closest friends <UNK> frank wisdom to the narrator is reduced to a sort of named extra with only a few throw away lines and <UNK> of comical outfits br br the fabulous <UNK> a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film <UNK> up and all but ignored br br the <UNK> father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film he's played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> of his marriage to the <UNK> mum seems for all practical purposes ignored br br in its favour the music for what it is is well composed and you have to give the production and writing <UNK> credit for actually taking a line from the book some days they'll write musicals about the 1950s as their inspiration to write a musical but in the world of bad <UNK> up musicals this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch unlike shock treatment or <UNK> crucial plot elements are treated as <UNK> unlike the apple there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue br br you really can't blame it's too 1980s feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s the film version of annie released in 1981 pays a wonderfully well executed tribute to the look and feel of new york city in the 1930s and <UNK> dynamite manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003 though it's not <UNK> set in the 1980s those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film feels very 1980s obviously it was possible to make something good out of this especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the uk but it fails most apparently in the look and feel and also in its treatment of the source material which is downright <UNK> br br perhaps if you haven't read and have no intentions of reading the novel you could enjoy this campy 1980s <UNK> giving a shameful parody of late 1950s <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jazz set i can definitely see what the writing team were attempting but they definitely could have done better with boy george as a household name and mixed race musicians and bands on the <UNK> in 1986 uk they definitely did not need to <UNK> the characters in the ways that they ended up doing in fact i'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film <UNK> <UNK> it ended up having a bunch of adults <UNK> out crap and treating its targeted teen aged audience like two bit idiots to make a quick buck off of
<START> wow my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not <UNK> i will try to tone this one down lets be real no one wants to see a chuck norris movie where he is not the main character there was a good fight scene at the end but the rest of the movie <UNK> i have to wonder if old chuck just can't hang with the best any more has he <UNK> down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie chuck is an awesome martial artist and as we have seen from walker texas ranger a fairly good actor but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies and this one does not very disappointing for us norris fans chuck stay as the main character in your movies because this does not work for you gary
<START> i grew up watching and loving <UNK> i just recently finished watching the entire series st voyager on dvd which may have <UNK> my sense of disgust with this episode as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more stark the idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand <UNK> character which is how it probably would have been treated on <UNK> they could have featured memories that would be new to the audience rather than simply <UNK> old show clips the in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as cliché in the beginning and very quickly become <UNK> as the tired pattern wears on and on bar none worst episode ever
<START> no wonder pamela <UNK> gave up acting to become a full time photographer it's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one while this movie is not without its interesting elements <UNK> from hell etc it is <UNK> by flaws for one thing angela the murderous <UNK> appears to be about the same age as the <UNK> having an older more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film and then you have the murder scenes the budget was apparently too low to <UNK> most of them properly no pun intended although drowning someone in an <UNK> toilet is certainly original but overall there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching
<START> if you're the kind of movie goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense then look elsewhere kids cause <UNK> really sucks usually i'm more <UNK> than that but wow this was bad i especially love it when charles offers <UNK> a ride home she <UNK> and then he is seen walking home where's his car anyway just don't see it folks i really want to be more specific but words escape me cats jumping on people a guy getting stabbed by corn <UNK> lines up the proverbial <UNK> just don't see it wait i take that back see it for writer stephen king's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard he's actually pretty good even with guest appearances by mark <UNK> and ron <UNK> king gives the best performance of the film but other than that wow bad
<START> i'm not going to say that this movie is horrible because i have seen worse but it's not even halfway decent br br the plot is very confusing i couldn't really figure out what was happening and where things were going when the movie was over i was left scratching my head i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it i felt like i was <UNK> from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two br br character development is very shallow i couldn't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone i couldn't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk stoned mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them this film seems to be based around stereotypes to it's credit they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band which should make character development easier since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean stereotypes are easy to depict which would explain why so many bad films tend to <UNK> stereotypical characters this film on the other hand uses stereotypical characters left and right but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible br br another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be <UNK> with no explanation i guess that's ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn't get a chance to know any of them so i never really missed any of them br br and last but not least was <UNK> singing it's awful the music backing her up is not prize winner but it is usually drowned out by the <UNK> that are released from <UNK> vocal <UNK> i swear that there's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this <UNK> a <UNK> br br as a whole this movie is confusing characters are ill developed <UNK> acting is wooden and stiff <UNK> character is <UNK> from one bad situation to another with no back story or explanation the music was unbearable and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a <UNK> for cinematic pain
<START> this movie really shows its age the print i saw was terrible due to age but it is possible that there are better <UNK> out there however this was not the major problem with the movie the problem was that although the film was made in 1933 it was essentially a silent film with only the <UNK> of dialog scattered only a few sentences in the film in the most amateur fashion sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and <UNK> hide the fact that the film was dubbed well its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious it just looked cheap br br overall the film looked low budget and silly it's really a shame though because there was a grain of a good story a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and or has no interest in women but in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this <UNK> mess even with a few glimpses of the naked and somewhat <UNK> hedy <UNK> it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it <UNK> even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different <UNK> looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america she looks like 2 completely different people br br it's such an <UNK> looking and technically inferior film i don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews for technical problems alone the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it
<START> <UNK> made it again another masterpiece a <UNK> comedy full of his own <UNK> with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments we laughed and laughed what a party the music is everywhere and also the shooting the animals the crazy <UNK> sex and amazing <UNK> and <UNK> everything <UNK> visual to entertain only pure cinema in essence a wonderful experience to watch and one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare and so wonderful well this is one and if you enjoyed <UNK> previous films you'll love this although as in all comedies it is about a chemical reaction and you have to be in the mood for it
<START> this film is like a 1950 version of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> less sex and less realism but a tale with great <UNK> and warmth i wouldn't call this a neo realistic picture it's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale and should probably be <UNK> as a comedy although it deals with serious matters a little like chaplin or 1930 comedy typical italian though very emotional and hard to resist except for a stone cold person the <UNK> is a letdown although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama it's not a masterpiece like <UNK> d or the <UNK> thief but it is a lovable and hilarious comedy with good music br br 7 10
<START> the last wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind the title refers to the <UNK> <UNK> theory there will be one last wave that <UNK> out everything br br david burton richard chamberlain is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some <UNK> accused of murder around this time there has been unusually heavy <UNK> in australia while defending the <UNK> david learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether it's just mythology br br the movie's last sequence is a metaphor for <UNK> into the depths of one's mind peter <UNK> created a <UNK> but thought provoking movie <UNK> actor david <UNK> whom you may have seen in <UNK> crocodile <UNK> and rabbit proof fence provides an interesting supporting role as one of the <UNK> br br if you get a chance watch the making of feature on the dvd peter <UNK> explains some of the film's undertones some of which relate to richard <UNK> background
<START> oh it's the movie i thought i waited too long to take out the dog i can't believe i watched the whole thing i guess i was <UNK> <UNK> that it was going to get better horribly disjointed dialog pathetic acting and totally improbable events like <UNK> mom hanging herself in the time it takes <UNK> to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a <UNK> ceiling and no <UNK> <UNK> or anything around her <UNK> suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in the little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie and the puppy of the first couple was a close second the basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick but this version sadly is not it i get more scared when i open my electric bill every month
<START> i recently bought this movie and i do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact i am very please have this movie to add to my collection matt <UNK> and phil <UNK> movie directors took less than one month to film and spent about 1 million <UNK> to produce this great movie this proves that not only big productions make great movies br br the title of this movie fits in perfectly in computer language bug means program error which causes reactions in computer function our reactions can cause these negative side effects but also great moments of beauty the <UNK> happenings in this movie start with the death of a bug a man witnesses the crime on the other side of the road from there <UNK> everything gets complicated br br i point out john <UNK> lynch <UNK> <UNK> the man who cannot make everything right at all
<START> before watching this film i had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film but listening wasn't doing it for me so i planned on watching it and wow ned beatty <UNK> cox jon voight and burt reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on <UNK> down the <UNK> river and the unfortunate series of events that <UNK> upon them all the character development takes some time in <UNK> the viewer with a better understanding of each person but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend the acting dialogue is very very real as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting reynolds character lewis was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the <UNK> <UNK> lies a very soft and broken man i was impressed with his performance jon voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and <UNK> him into a different man at the end his character transition was excellent ned beatty and <UNK> cox really seem like the silly <UNK> that just like to joke around and don't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too and they did i really was amazed at director <UNK> vision of <UNK> novel very impressed you cannot go your whole life without watching this film i give it eight out of ten stars extremely impressed
<START> this show is a great history story it's has everything from slavery the way they were treated religion the ways jews were sent into hiding the <UNK> the belief in the <UNK> the african gods the way women were treated including the daughters even down to homosexuality the way the characters are <UNK> and that <UNK> that character <UNK> me she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her i am so glad they decided to re release it to t v again although i would love to see the <UNK> version <UNK> has become my heroine i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century i look forward to my <UNK> every night it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too
<START> this is just a short comment but i stumbled onto this movie by chance and i loved it the acting is great the story is simple and touching and the lines especially from the 4 <UNK> old <UNK> are so cute and sad seek it out
<START> abc has done more for this show by allowing television veterans james garner and david spade to join the cast of this show at first the show was watchable and even predictable with john ritter and <UNK> <UNK> john's loss shocked the world <UNK> and the three kids are really a solid professional cast the hour lesson after john's death in real life struck home to me i lost my father at 17 years old and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony abc should be proud to maintain this show and even <UNK> this as john's final wish this show has <UNK> and developed because of such impossible circumstances they should be rewarded with <UNK>
<START> this is one of the two <UNK> fantasy movies that albert <UNK> made in 1993 and it's the bad one apparently all his energy went into nemesis which was an entertaining non stop action movie and had a much more expensive look knights is clunky and cheesy a bottom of the barrel sci fi that too often resembles a video game new opponents pop up all the time and must be <UNK> as quickly as possible the only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is kathy long not a particularly attractive woman but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine as for kris kristofferson considering his age at the time <UNK> i hope his stunt double was well paid 1 2
<START> any person with fairly good knowledge of german cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past if such a film is shown to people again it would surely click provided if it has something new fresh and captivating for today's challenging audiences this is also true for german film maker <UNK> <UNK> as her film's principal protagonist <UNK> has been <UNK> by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend she is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including <UNK> <UNK> was originally shot on <UNK> to be blown afterwards to 35 <UNK> format its technical <UNK> does not <UNK> our <UNK> when we learn that <UNK> would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is <UNK> to the idea of becoming a run of the mill <UNK> if someone were to state a positive aspect of <UNK> <UNK> film it may well be <UNK> involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment it is with <UNK> that we learn that <UNK> are human too with their unique <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> ironic that dr <UNK> fable <UNK> the non <UNK> of christmas should be one of the most hyped <UNK> and successful blockbusters of the holiday season the general <UNK> of ron <UNK> adaptation is that the <UNK> <UNK> against christmas <UNK> from an early childhood incident and that the <UNK> themselves are caught up in the <UNK> of the season save for cindy lou who played very well by taylor <UNK> this movie makes an <UNK> ambitious attempt to capture the <UNK> and sentiment of <UNK> story but the end result is a movie that <UNK> and never quite packs the emotional punch of chuck jones' animated version jim carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the <UNK> grinch but whether it's the dialogue the pacing or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> upon the initial plot the transformation from bitter <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> just does not <UNK> convincingly there are some wonderful visuals and the make up work is amazing yet beyond the technical <UNK> there's an element or two here that's missing br br <UNK> br br soul br br or maybe jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25 minute cartoon that howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long howard carey and crew are all very capable and talented but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product if you must see the feature length version rent it on video with jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and <UNK> is not always better i give this film three <UNK> of who <UNK> out of five
<START> seems everyone in this film is <UNK> woody allen they <UNK> and pause and <UNK> some more only for really die hard <UNK> fans it tries to appear as edgy and artistic but it comes off as looking like a very very low budget film made by college students the most often used word in the whole film is hum the film does <UNK> the atmosphere of the late sixties early seventies though if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other horrible lighting even if it is for <UNK> sake and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting then you might like this but you need to be really bored i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why
<START> what a dud it began with some promise then became <UNK> and <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> accent was laughable bridget <UNK> role existed only to get a <UNK> into the film and pacino did pacino his entire generation of actors nicholson hackman caine hoffman have developed a standard performance that each can deliver effortlessly or less <UNK> mail in in their paycheck films this was one
<START> not even the most <UNK> <UNK> fan could possibly like the movie i one of them the stooges just aren't given any material to work with it is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with curly and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny when it could have had great potential awful musical numbers don't help any either the short they did with the same title has more laughs
<START> in 1955 <UNK> <UNK> disappeared in the <UNK> amazon one year later he walked out of the jungle naked it took him 45 years to go back supposedly keep the river on your right is a modern cannibal tale in reality anyone looking for some insight into <UNK> will be sadly disappointed the first half of the movie is more like a travel <UNK> of new <UNK> mostly <UNK> the native art the second half relies on still photos of a <UNK> cannibal tribe but really that's about it unless of course you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding or <UNK> introducing his former male lovers i give up big disappointment and not really a modern cannibal tale <UNK>
<START> for me this movie was powerful i don't want to be a spoiler but i had a friend years ago we were like brothers this movie brought back some vivid memories br br for some reason i couldn't place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10 i kept getting a message like no votes have been placed and yet i saw in the <UNK> that there were will try again tomorrow monday br br minor flaws i overlooked it was the relationships between the characters that got me beautifully acted and real situations i've been in a couple of them br br a small gem of a movie just like spring forward is another overlooked gem i'm very glad movies like these are still being made about relationships between people well written <UNK> <UNK> with first class acting and direction after all isn't that what it's all about
<START> trust me this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge denzel washington fan the frustrating part is that it's 1 3 of a great film the first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between creasy and the girl he's paid to protect the trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped so i'm giving nothing away when i say that the film <UNK> into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped whatever the director was trying to accomplish all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally <UNK> rapid frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half hour as creasy tracks down the <UNK> these cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to <UNK> you out of the story i'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story <UNK> a change in <UNK> character and <UNK> that a different movie was to follow well he was right the movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap the result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie
<START> the movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do the films props itself as a fun and entertaining time and that's exactly what it was it is the korean version of a male bring it on br br from the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a <UNK> copy of another instead the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining thugs came to be men in their own right therefore the film is fun and entertaining br br the camera work specially the <UNK> moves were very well executed the script being a tad weak was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire this film will not win any oscars nor any dvd blockbuster sales but a fun watch and a fun experience
<START> i went into this film with expectations from the hype that it would be insightful and uplifting certainly something more than a cheap <UNK> for the band <UNK> br br instead we get a lot of <UNK> and whining about the process a <UNK> and no doubt one sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the <UNK> donna lead singer <UNK> a gut wrenching confession by the fallen <UNK> friend for like 18 years saying the friendship had run its course and this whiny <UNK> story about how one record label hurt their feelings by <UNK> them only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other <UNK> oh the tension not they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn't exist this doesn't even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their <UNK> songs shoved at us in full without any storyline insight or even a decent job at cinematography the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch br br from the film this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don't have and think they're some kind of <UNK> for the art of music which they most definitely are not and i thought the music sucked and i couldn't even understand the lyrics due to the <UNK> style of the lead singer br br i give it a 2 10
<START> the van <UNK> movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time br br the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york and the impression i had of trying to be as american as possible which i think has absolutely failed br br the scenes in the back really got to my heart the german actress <UNK> <UNK> completely deserved her award she is one of the most <UNK> actress i have ever seen in future i will watch more of her movies great luck for me that i am a native german speaking and only for a year in the us so as soon as i am back i'll buy some <UNK> dvds br br so to all out there who have not seen this movie yet watch it i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain but simply <UNK> it you will be <UNK>
<START> i saw this film at <UNK> international documentary film festival and was <UNK> to meet both the directors and <UNK> <UNK> all of whom are lively and <UNK> new <UNK> the film's title in <UNK> was keep the river on your right making the sensational aspect of <UNK> somewhat less prominent equally important was the loving and gay relationship <UNK> <UNK> had with members of the groups he studied as an <UNK> his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave taking were very moving i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian
<START> i may be getting ahead of myself here but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time i watched it piece by piece on tcm last night the question <UNK> to me why did they do that putting their lives in <UNK> many of them died on the trek why would they <UNK> such a life <UNK> journey just to find food for their animals once they reached the land of milk and honey why didn't they just stay there would you <UNK> your life and that of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cattle as dangerous as it was to do it for that purpose alone shows the <UNK> simplicity of these types of people risk death for a cow better them than i
<START> the only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh i had high hopes as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movies but this just didn't qualify it's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity which again isn't a bad plot but is done poorly here there are some scenes such as the ending which are not intended to be funny but actually made me laugh out loud there were a couple of times when i thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction but it never <UNK> what it could and should be in my opinion if you are looking for a christmas slasher flick try silent night deadly night
<START> encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i've seen <UNK> films and this is truly one of the worst of them it's awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline <UNK> ' soundtrack the film's only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film br br the only thing that <UNK> me giving this a 1 score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel <UNK> only
<START> this was a good movie it wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different this movie showed us <UNK> in training before the war and not actually fighting a war this film is one of the more <UNK> views on war and the army than most other films like this made colin <UNK> did a great job at portraying an army <UNK> and <UNK> collins jr and also matthew davis contributed reasonably well seeing colin <UNK> move from b grade to a grade in a few short years you would never thought it would happen i will also add that the makers of <UNK> did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future
<START> i really wanted to like this movie the location shots were mostly filmed in <UNK> and the trailer had some wonderful photography but even for a filmed cartoon it was a really badly made movie the continuity and pacing were both simply awful the best bits in the movie are under the ending credits so it's almost worth sticking it out to the end though oddly it does pick up a little over the last half hour or so br br when the best performance in a movie is by andy dick you know there's got to be a problem
<START> i really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between american <UNK> and japanese women in post war japan as well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them brando goes from having contempt for the japanese which is natural considering ww2 to falling in love with a japanese woman and wanting to marry her his performance is okay i am not a major fan of his acting style and the movie is marvelous throughout red buttons received an oscar for his touching performance of another <UNK> who falls in love in japan though the japanese women who plays opposite him also did a remarkable job br br i don't want to spoil it but the movie is a good one to watch with a box of <UNK> br br this movie manages to say something and be entertaining at the same time a mostly underrated gem
<START> my personal favorite horror film from the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist this is carpenter's masterpiece br br halloween night 1963 little michael meyers murders his older sister all <UNK> eve 1978 michael escapes from smith's <UNK> <UNK> halloween night michael has come home to murder again br br the story is perfectly simple michael stalks and kills <UNK> no <UNK> or <UNK> just the <UNK> it's carpenter's almost over <UNK> atmosphere of dread that <UNK> the tension like any great horror film events are <UNK> long in advance yet they still seem to occur at random never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film br br the dark lighting the long steady <UNK> shots and most importantly that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes i have yet to see in film there is a body count but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small that and most of the murders are nearly <UNK> the fear is not in death but in not knowing br br the acting is <UNK> good <UNK> soles provides much of the films limited humor and one of the best deaths nancy <UNK> turns in a decent performance and then there is the young at the time jamie leigh curtis her performance at first seems shy and un assured yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character who is herself shy and un assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face and of course there is the perfectly cast donald <UNK> as the determined perhaps a little unstable dr sam <UNK> rest in peace mr <UNK> br br if the film has a <UNK> flaw it would be the passage of time since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless <UNK> copies rip offs and <UNK> have come along and stolen usually badly the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar combined with the changes for audience expectations and <UNK> one finds much of the films raw power <UNK> to truly appreciate it in this day and age it must be viewed as it once was as something unique br br never the less i have no <UNK> with highly <UNK> this film to anyone looking for a good scary time highest <UNK> br br 10 10
<START> i totally disagree i thought that this was a great movie for kids dawn wells from <UNK> island and promise shown of a barely then known dana <UNK> it was <UNK> and for that it can hardly be <UNK> as meaningless fluff no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be i wont ruin the ending but it was unusual the way that it was done i mean the kids characters were great and i didn't know what to expect in the end the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert <UNK> is very central to the plot especially initially it also helps them out of a jam towards the end it also has the plus of not being overly long i think it <UNK> in at under 95 minutes
<START> begin spoiler <UNK> funny and memorable for mr <UNK> literal roach smoking scene chong <UNK> <UNK> a stray kitchen <UNK> into his <UNK> bowl lights up <UNK> and <UNK> violently for a seeming eternity then with perfect <UNK> and not skipping a beat re loads the bowl properly re lights re <UNK> end spoiler alas i began to lose faith less than half way through the proceedings it occurred to me that the <UNK> duo are way obnoxious and less than <UNK> i have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary <UNK> harold and kumar i simply prefer <UNK> company yet the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble minded as to be <UNK> by a <UNK> when they the former are sober notable guest appearance by paul <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in pre pee wee form
<START> with the release of peter jackson's famed lord of the rings trilogy it is even easier to dismiss ralph bakshi's 1978 animated lord of the rings film as inferior i agree with the majority that jackson's trilogy is the essential film adaptation of <UNK> work but that does not prevent me from enjoying bakshi's ambitious <UNK> effort jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing bakshi's film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations br br the film's colorful <UNK> backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable i was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters the <UNK> of <UNK> and merry and <UNK> and <UNK> are mostly <UNK> from each other visually the <UNK> and <UNK> were unimpressive but these points didn't bother me very much however the <UNK> are <UNK> drawn and made <UNK> eerie the only character representation i was bothered by was <UNK> he was made to look <UNK> silly br br this film is novel for its animation techniques in addition to hand drawn characters live actors are <UNK> into the animation through <UNK> it is quite apparent which characters are hand drawn and which are <UNK> but none the less i found that the film's style was a novelty the use of <UNK> live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well br br the voice acting was generally of high quality particularly good was john hurt who provided an <UNK> voice for <UNK> <UNK> isn't a favorite character of mine from the stories but backed by john <UNK> voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation my other favorite was william <UNK> whose voice is appropriately strong for <UNK> the only actor who seemed inappropriate was michael <UNK> as sam whose voice acting was irritating and added to <UNK> unfortunately silly image the only other <UNK> part of the voice acting is the <UNK> of character and place names particularly strange was the decision to frequently have <UNK> referred to as <UNK> br br in producing this film ralph bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films hence this film contains about half the story from the start of the <UNK> of the ring to the end of the battle at <UNK> deep in the two towers the obvious <UNK> of this is that the film's story is a highly <UNK> version of the story from the books i enjoy the original stories and more <UNK> adaptations but the liberties taken to <UNK> the story didn't bother me even the choice to leave <UNK> out of the story enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to <UNK> through half the lord of the rings story in <UNK> minutes the battle scenes were impressive and in particular the <UNK> march to and battle at <UNK> deep were tremendous br br ralph bakshi's version of the lord of the rings isn't perfect and no doubt a number of lord of the rings readers <UNK> the cuts to the story however for me the <UNK> of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy my only strong <UNK> is that i am unable to see the second part of this first great tale of the lord of the rings since bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel
<START> this movie is not the same as the 1954 version with judy garland and james mason and that is a shame because the 1954 version is in my opinion much better i am not denying barbra <UNK> talent at all she is a good actress and brilliant singer i am not <UNK> with kris <UNK> other work and therefore i can't pass judgment on it however this movie leaves much to be desired it is paced slowly it has gratuitous nudity and foul language and can be very difficult to sit through br br however i am not a big fan of rock music so it's only natural that i would like the judy garland version better see the 1976 film with barbra and kris and judge for yourself
<START> i had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as i did when i saw daniel day lewis play christy brown in my left foot in fact off the scene his role wasn't even over he played the role of christy brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back to me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role i believe it is quite true to say he put on the most oscar worthy performance in history he was so masterful in this tough a part that i believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him although i cannot say it is the greatest movie of all time i can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it wasn't even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet i will ever seen an actor do probably a man too for that matter
<START> this horror movie based on the novel of the same name suffers from flawed production and choppy amateurish direction but it's nonetheless strangely compelling unlike shocker horror flicks such as the exorcist this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless <UNK> into a pool of evil it <UNK> into horror which <UNK> on the audience with the same <UNK> <UNK> as it <UNK> on the poor girl who's been <UNK> chosen to be the next sentinel her <UNK> task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from <UNK> into the world this falls on her in <UNK> for her attempted suicide earlier in her life br br the story is true to the book which was riveting but the way it's edited can lose the viewer there are subtleties in the plot that are <UNK> away and never explained <UNK> which hurts this film that's a pity the sentinel is not an edge of your seat kind of flick it's more a watch and <UNK> <UNK> like a bad car wreck there's a <UNK> to look even when it becomes unbearable this movie isn't all bad and still has a capacity to shock br br the cast was competent christina raines was captivating as alison the vulnerable girl under spiritual attack from both sides a <UNK> in the never ending battle between good and evil chris sarandon was good as her caring but ultimately self centered boyfriend eli <UNK> and a very young christopher walken are the detectives struggling to unravel the bizarre puzzle they've been handed <UNK> <UNK> is elegant as the <UNK> unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property the <UNK> elderly john carradine with his <UNK> twisted hands is excellent as the dying sentinel who must be replaced the devil is played to charming perfection by burgess meredith he's so sweet and yet so evil there are future stars hidden in this film beverly <UNK> and jeff goldblum as friends of the poor girl and jerry <UNK> playing successfully against type as a jerky television director the damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual <UNK> freaks and <UNK> whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius br br the horror that <UNK> the movie <UNK> up unexpectedly such as when alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two <UNK> she <UNK> her first suicide attempt faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians and sees a cat cut up as a cake time and again she's <UNK> back and forth through reality and fantasy through dreams and waking nightmares all the while lacking the means to cope in truth the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel will he succeed in summary slow moving yet <UNK> creepy well acted but poorly directed and a very typical 70's horror film before the real <UNK> cut loose no pun intended this movie may not work for those with a short attention span but it can still send chills up the spine and still can provide some low key shock value it remains a strangely compelling and entertaining <UNK> into the realm of evil
<START> but how can you stand to <UNK> a baseball team that can't win for george knox it is not easy as the movie opens roger <UNK> joseph gordon <UNK> and his best friend j p <UNK> davis jr are riding on <UNK> <UNK> around the <UNK> stadium when they return to <UNK> foster mother's home roger is <UNK> to have a visit from his dad <UNK> <UNK> his mom is dead and when he asks his father when they going to be a family again he father jokes i say when the angels win the division championship so later on roger and j p hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball when the <UNK> george knox danny glover take out his <UNK> the <UNK> gets mad and gets into a fight with him and soon the angels team get into the <UNK> that gets knox <UNK> from the game that night roger makes a <UNK> for the angles win the championship when his foster mother maggie nelson brenda <UNK> agrees that roger and j p go to a <UNK> roger sees real angles come on the field and helps the left <UNK> matthew <UNK> makes a catch that leaves the <UNK> and the play by play man jay o sanders how did he to that roger learns from the head angel christopher lloyd that only he can see the angles because he was the only that <UNK> for help br br 10 10
<START> because that's all she does through out this whole movie is get naked for no good reason when tarzan is bitten by a snake she suddenly <UNK> her clothes since when is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> how did tarzan get <UNK> by the way this whole movie is screwed up they couldn't get the species of animals for this movie right whats an <UNK> doing hanging around those <UNK> he must have <UNK> off the set of a much better film the group of cannibal <UNK> men look <UNK> why and why was bo and her dad painted if they were going to be eaten later it was probably just a lame excuse to show her breasts and <UNK> again her dad while hunting approaches and acts <UNK> around a bull elephant while standing too close to it any real african bull elephant that wasn't from the circus would've <UNK> this <UNK> butt any smart hunter would've started shooting the minute he saw it and i can't help but wonder if the camera was on <UNK> because it kept showing various scenes that went in slow motion for no good reason it didn't make good sense at all the <UNK> <UNK> that tarzan <UNK> with in the water looks like one of those 12 <UNK> rubber snakes you can buy at a local spencer gifts tarzan was <UNK> speechless in this film maybe from bo flashing herself so much i'm sorry but this is a rip off of a classic black and white tarzan movie with a similar but better story not to mention plotting there's one scene in that i saw that everyone forgot to mention spoilers alert the scene where he is trying to rescue jane and her dad has him standing too close to a running water <UNK> it made it seem like he's <UNK> on someone below him <UNK> also him and jane are <UNK> around on a beach with perverted monkeys jumping and <UNK> she sure did take her <UNK> death real well end of spoilers there should be a surgeon <UNK> warning on this film that seeing bo naked too much in this movie will make you go blind
<START> i <UNK> this out and watched it tonight i honestly think it must be 20 years since the last time i saw it i remember it being a seriously flawed film i don't remember it being this bad br br i am absolutely <UNK> that a project with this much potential should have been <UNK> so <UNK> who am i to blame for this the 2 guys who wrote and i use that word loosely the script the casting directors who so terribly miscast at least 3 major characters in the story only 2 of them are among the amazing 5 the director who clearly refused to take it seriously and kept <UNK> awful music on top of bad writing bad acting everywhere i liked the theme song but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film don black who should be ashamed at some of the lyrics he wrote for that music br br it figures that i should pull this out less than a week after re reading the comic book adaptation the first 15 20 minutes of the film more or less really less parallel the first issue of the comic as i watched it tonight i kept wondering why was almost every single detail changed doc showing up then using his <UNK> watch remote control to open the safe and the <UNK> bullet missing him by 5 <UNK> because the <UNK> glass were just about the only things left the same i mean if you're gonna do an adaptation why in god's name change everything br br once they leave <UNK> <UNK> virtually nothing is as it was in the comic which given roy thomas i figure probably follows the book i read somewhere they actually combined elements of 2 different novels into one movie again why i've heard it was changed because they weren't able to secure the kind of budget they wanted i look at the film and think lack of money in no way explains what i saw on the screen br br you know when people complain about joel <UNK> they should really take a look at this thing the best thing i can say is i think it would make a great double feature with the 1966 batman feature and probably a great triple bill with that and the 1980 flash gordon all 3 films are silly maybe we can blame the 1966 film and tv series for this some fans have complained over the years that adam <UNK> batman ruined the image of comic books in the minds of generations of non comics fans i think the same could be said for hollywood i'm reminded of how many really really bad films based on classic characters have been made over the years especially it seems to me in the late 70's early 80's charlie chan fu <UNK> tarzan buck rogers flash gordon the lone ranger all murdered by hollywood types who think oh comic books so you know it's supposed to be stupid more like they're the stupid ones what a waste of potential br br let me say some good things despite the script and the directing ron <UNK> is great when i read a doc savage story i don't think of the james <UNK> paintings i think of <UNK> bill <UNK> who later was a regular on the a team is terrific <UNK> quick who i've seen somewhere else but can't recall where is terrific paul <UNK> who i absolutely hated with a passion and a vengeance in the breakfast club teachers like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere may be the best of the amazing 5 in the film pamela <UNK> though her part was almost <UNK> from the original story is terrific before she let her hair down i also realized she looked a hell of a lot like <UNK> <UNK> from those awful john <UNK> buck rogers <UNK> i just read the other day she's got a big nose like <UNK> only not quite as <UNK> the comics <UNK> actually looked more like the 1936 movie princess aura or cher or maybe streisand take <UNK> pick <UNK> actually got plastic surgery in the george <UNK> <UNK> after she was stunning br br paul <UNK> funny enough i saw just last week in a get smart episode i wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing i don't know because that character sure wasn't in the movie the film takes its title from
<START> actually had to stop it don't get me wrong love bad monster movies but this one was way too boring regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere the actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the <UNK> was way too obvious a cliché this film totally betrays the cover on the dvd which looks pretty interesting from the cover one expects a giant monster but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric <UNK> moved on to watch another film called the killer rats but that's another review deep shock was really crap a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget
<START> i love the episode where jim becomes the <UNK> it is great when jim <UNK> that little person through the window the look on his face is priceless then when he starts to address the priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the pee woman great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see i am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode i'd like to use it as my <UNK> on a message board because i think the <UNK> is hilarious does anyone know where i can <UNK> a photo of jim as the <UNK> can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo
<START> this movie is just crap even though the directors claim to be part of that <UNK> culture it's still a very very bad directorial debut the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very <UNK> and naive directing there's no timing at all in that movie i felt like the directors were so <UNK> to do that movie it's their first feature that they actually never really asked themselves what story they wanna tell i met ben one of the directors on several occasions and he's a nice and thoughtful guy but that doesn't make him a director i think that american history x is full of clichés but somehow manages to transport a story <UNK> warning is full of clichés doesn't tell anything new or provocative and that's the sad thing about this movie it's far from any <UNK> reality br br if you wanna see weird but great german films watch the movies of michael <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hans <UNK> or oliver <UNK> br br <UNK> video funny games die <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film <UNK> experiment <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br out of ten because of the topic and the photography
<START> when american author edgar allan poe visits london he is approached by british journalist alan foster who becomes the target of a peculiar <UNK> not believing <UNK> <UNK> that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience foster accepts a bet from poe and his friend sir thomas <UNK> that he cannot spend an entire night in the <UNK> haunted castle once <UNK> in the abandoned castle foster discovers that he is not alone as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of <UNK> who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their <UNK> on the <UNK> of their deaths the first time i watched this glorious bit of classic horror i was <UNK> the entire time i found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time <UNK> <UNK> steele is undeniably beautiful the music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing the topless scene threw me for a loop as i was not expecting it it looks as <UNK> did a great job with picture <UNK> because this movie looks damn fine for its age and it's the uncut international version to boot this is the movie responsible for me starting a <UNK> steele and <UNK> kinski collection
<START> this movie is despite its independent status a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating mother daughter relationship it <UNK> that bad at first but somewhere during the course of the movie around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy i think it turns into a <UNK> mother daughter bonding movie im sorry but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter its probably better that way though
<START> seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be i watched the first two fight scenes listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by <UNK> and all of the other thrown in oriental actors and i found the movie so awful that it was funny then brandon lee enters the story and the one liners start flying the plot falls apart the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome as it turns into the worst action movie ever br br <UNK> beats out his previous efforts in the <UNK> and others as well as all of van <UNK> movies <UNK> movies and <UNK> non rocky movies for this distinct honor this movie has the absolute worst acting check out <UNK> <UNK> face when she is in any scene with dolph that's worth a laugh with the worst dialogue ever brandon lee's comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film and the worst outfit in a film dolph in full japanese <UNK> picture tango and cash with worse acting meets <UNK> meets friday the 13th because of the senseless nudity and <UNK> performance is very jason <UNK> like in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie br br the good how about not awful performances go to the bad guy who still looks <UNK> through his entire performance and <UNK> who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing brandon lee is just there being <UNK> sidekick and doing a really awful job at that br br an awful awful movie fear it and avoid it if you do watch it though ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non underwater shots speaking of the underwater shots check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight scene ending ever this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention <UNK> and to fill in between the flashes of nudity br br a bad bad movie
<START> i must say i was surprised with the quality of the movie it was far better than i expected scenario and acting is quite good the director made a good job as well although some scenes look a bit clumsy it is a decent movie overall the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good the plot was clear consistent and well thought some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development moral of the story it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good
<START> james bond in the wilderness well that's the way it looks pierce brosnan is after all best known as bond in <UNK> never dies 1997 and golden eye 1995 both shot prior to this release frankly the film's two leads are both badly miscast with brosnan turning in the <UNK> more convincing performance and with annie <UNK> as <UNK> grey <UNK> love interest having to battle with <UNK> written dialogue br br the two aunts on the other hand are perfect but the film is not about aunts it is about the <UNK> of the canadian wilderness and while the photography may be pretty there is no <UNK> to the harsh reality of living in the <UNK> annie <UNK> as <UNK> just fails to be convincing unfortunately because i really wanted to believe in her she was a relatively inexperienced twenty year old on this film and it could have worked but richard attenborough was maybe just not tough enough on her he makes her look vulnerable which of course she is but in the wrong sort of way br br but one thing for sure she appears picture perfect throughout but <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the wilderness it just doesn't fit especially as she only ever seems to walk forest trials with bond sorry grey owl and use photo <UNK> for kissing close ups br br i've lived with forest people in the pacific north west and they simply don't look this pretty and stay so sweet while fighting for survival which brings me to another point the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set the 1930s i put the blame here largely on a lack <UNK> script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action br br william nicholson wrote the screenplay and his latest offering elizabeth the golden age opened three days ago so i do hope there is an improvement br br yes i've read the comments others have posted but i'm not convinced a lot of potential but <UNK> and even maybe ill conceived if it had had a religious film it would have been <UNK> but because it <UNK> <UNK> the film remains somewhat above criticism since it is politically correct sorry for all that i don't buy it <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has been golden before with the likes of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> so i went into the movie at an indian <UNK> with high hopes especially after the slick <UNK> unfortunately like <UNK> before it this movie was a huge disappointment br br like others have commented the premise of the movie which was already stale to begin with just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional <UNK> after a while you just want the movie to end so you can go home if i had been watching this at home it would have been much easier to cut my <UNK> akshay <UNK> performance is average at best and john abraham should not try doing comedy again the comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week i only remember <UNK> like twice the entire movie definitely no <UNK> belly laughs that consumed me in <UNK> <UNK> or even to a lesser extent in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had a few of his expected classic moments but overall because his role and character wasn't given much room to grow he didn't make much of an impact in this film br br <UNK> <UNK> who makes only an appearance in the movie was fun to look at while she was on screen and some of the songs are fun especially the opening and closing songs of <UNK> and kiss me baby respectively otherwise you're better off just passing on this movie
<START> this movie was just terrible the first movie wasn't that great i mean it's ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one why just not make this into an ongoing series like james bond i'll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink i don't understand was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness <UNK> my 1 year old niece wouldn't be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film please no more of these movies
<START> i first saw this film when i was flipping through the movie channels on my parents <UNK> it was on the sundance channel and was just starting i love music especially late 60s and this is what the <UNK> sounded like the <UNK> are alright everything about the brian <UNK> massacre intrigued me from the music to anton and <UNK> personalities to the <UNK> drug use it was funny because as i was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch the look on their faces were priceless anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the brian <UNK> massacre who is now my favorite band of all time br br just watch it seriously
<START> i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex <UNK> <UNK> their triangle love were full of <UNK> frustration and jealous at last alex <UNK> up and realized that they would not have result and future ending up was sad br br the director <UNK> <UNK> was in <UNK> theatre on sunday 12 <UNK> on <UNK> 10 <UNK> with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the <UNK> to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of <UNK> br br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love <UNK> of alex and <UNK> and <UNK> and her brother <UNK> were kind of next door neighborhood story br br the two main reasons i don't like this movie are firstly the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which <UNK> was living then two girls are fall in love it doesn't make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much <UNK> you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didn't have a scene of alex and <UNK> sexual <UNK> that 's what i was waiting <UNK> however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear <UNK> part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear <UNK> to appreciate <UNK> love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate
<START> i was intrigued by the title so during a small bout of insomnia <UNK> by my curiosity i stayed up and watched it i then checked my tv <UNK> and watched it again there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film in spite of politics traditions culture etc teenagers everywhere are virtually the same the characters of the kids from <UNK> could have been transported to let's say somewhere in the american <UNK> during the same time period and language differences aside would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era they certainly displayed the same growing pains and <UNK> politics aside music sex movie <UNK> music drinking sports music as a matter of fact much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970's southern california br br this was a bittersweet story but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable the characters especially the young actors were completely believable also i won't say this was the <UNK> american <UNK> but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50's themed movies
<START> it was once suggested by pauline <UNK> never a fan that cassavetes thought not like a director but like an actor what <UNK> meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker to take that comparison further to me it never feels like cassavetes is directing himself in a film it feels like cassavetes <UNK> himself inside his own creation like orson welles cassavetes is just as much of a genius as welles but far more important as a true artist as opposed to a <UNK> or <UNK> this is like a cross between italian passion though cassavetes was actually greek and <UNK> <UNK> never before have inner demons been so exposed physically br br it's about the mystery of becoming performing and acting like a haunted skip james record it's got the echoes of ghosts all around <UNK> <UNK> which are <UNK> and almost operatic surprising coming from cassavetes are accompanied by a <UNK> unsettling piano who is this dead girl the <UNK> possibilities are endless and it's amazing to find this kind of thing in a cassavetes film just the overt display of intelligence there is also a brief bit of voice over at the beginning but then he always was intelligent he just never <UNK> it around for easy praise this is not adaptation here the <UNK> of reality and fiction and drama is not to show <UNK> but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates br br there's so much going on the pure <UNK> love when rowlands <UNK> her <UNK> the horror when she beats herself up the scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective <UNK> of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone you can see some roots of this in a star is born and <UNK> borrowed from it for all about my mother i think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits but the <UNK> leading up to it is almost sickening you can shoot me but i think the alcoholism despite its urgency in many of the scenes is a relatively small point about the film br br it's a living breathing thing and it feels like a process it could go any direction at any time like taste of <UNK> we are reminded that you must never forget this is only a play yet it is dangerous when rowlands says that line is it great drama how will the audience take it is she being <UNK> or does she just not care her character's <UNK> are <UNK> into the performances and ultimately the film in such a way that it's like witnessing a female james dean 10 10
<START> yeah it's a bit of a silly film so if you are looking for an oscar performance forget this one but if you love john <UNK> humor this is a must see we lost john candy before he made enough of his great brand of comedy and he is only better in one movie planes trains <UNK> with steve martin excellent supporting performance by eugene levy perhaps his best work ever as the hot headed <UNK> <UNK> also good acting by richard <UNK> alley mills pat <UNK> you must see this obscure and out of print film if you are a john candy or eugene levy fan
<START> as a former <UNK> resident with a <UNK> for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment although the acting and the production values aren't bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing br br the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children i can hardly believe how <UNK> it is in it's view of women has the writer been living under a rock br br although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone it's terrible it's an embarrassment to the city it's named after
<START> this is a <UNK> film featuring love through the ages the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age in ancient rome and in the present 1920s in all three cases he is the usual <UNK> buster and he battles against wallace <UNK> for his lady love of the three time periods i think i liked the roman one best even though i admit it might have also been the <UNK> i actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird <UNK> race in the snow but what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of keaton's amazing <UNK> however all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film while not his best is still an exceptional and enjoyable film check it out
<START> in order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it's supposed to be children's they had more <UNK> to follow in order to make this movie meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch sequels usually make me nervous however this one did pretty well for itself knowing that it didn't have the star power of <UNK> as george they <UNK> on the humor and i believe <UNK> did pretty well as the lead the plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award <UNK> this is not it but if you want to watch a simple fun energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one
<START> it doesn't take long to see why code name diamond head didn't make it onto the network <UNK> the tv pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it's obvious just how bad it's going to be maybe i missed something because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense based on what i got out of the muddled mess a terrorist or thief or something named tree ian <UNK> goes to hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon the world's <UNK> secret agent johnny paul roy <UNK> is out to stop him there might have been more but trust me  it really doesn't matter anyway br br action movies should have action suspenseful moments should have suspense and dramatic moments should have drama there's none of that in code name diamond head i've seen others use the word turgid to describe this made for tv <UNK>  and it's better than any one word description i can come up with none of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about and roy <UNK> makes for the worst leads imaginable his charisma is just slightly north of a slug ian <UNK> is easily the best thing the movie has going for it but unfortunately for everyone else involved it doesn't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member now if <UNK> had been cast in the series lead well then you might have had something br br i'm quickly discovering that these <UNK> awful 70s made for tv movies make great mystery science theater 3000 episodes and that goes double if quinn martin was involved very funny stuff from mike and the <UNK> so while i may only give the movie a 3 10 i rate episode <UNK> a 4 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> never saw the original movie in the series i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie it was however a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark really this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no <UNK> creek creature to be seen the only real <UNK> is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy <UNK> other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the <UNK> creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random <UNK> through the water not really worth watching i would however like to see the original granted the maker of that would make the also bad <UNK> creature of the 80's but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's the town the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a piece of s t this looks worse than a made for t v movie and i <UNK> to think that a sequel was even <UNK> and the results war is <UNK> than this jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now no script no story and no time should be wasted on this i mean that 1 out of 10 is too high way too high goldberg should be <UNK> for this van shame is no actor
<START> the book is fantastic this film is not there is no reason this film could not have <UNK> a futuristic technological vision of the book hell total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world the bleak german <UNK> colours the black and white footage from the vision screens there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984 the main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage this film decides to take a mock <UNK> approach to set design atmosphere and theme yet the novel did not necessarily <UNK> a communist worship the humble worker theme itself this book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before i could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap the soundtrack is annoying the lack of <UNK> is annoying this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the <UNK> messages to the viewer
<START> having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago <UNK> to originally see this on or a few days after <UNK> day i finally got to seeing <UNK> just this morning in this one marlon brando plays major lloyd ace <UNK> a <UNK> son who's been raised a certain way being <UNK> from korea to japan where his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> patricia <UNK> conveniently happens to be before leaving he tries to <UNK> one of his men a joe kelly red buttons out of marrying japanese woman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> since that's a <UNK> of military <UNK> laws with the romance of him and <UNK> on the outs however ace not only becomes the best man at joe and <UNK> wedding he falls for an asian himself after he and captain mike <UNK> james garner go out on the town and watch <UNK> entertainer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on stage <UNK> himself is dating one of the dancers <UNK> san <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> herself seems to have a fancy for one of the <UNK> performers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i'll stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning american asian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end even seeing hispanic <UNK> playing an oriental isn't too embarrassing though it's a good thing his part is short and there's some nice touches of humor like that of <UNK> head hitting the top of <UNK> and <UNK> inside <UNK> more than once red and <UNK> themselves deserve their oscars especially red with his <UNK> and proud emotions throughout rookie garner before being cast in his legendary role on tv's <UNK> is fine in his scenes with brando and <UNK> <UNK> shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an anti american while i've read there were some changes from james <UNK> novel i can't imagine director <UNK> logan who had previously adopted another <UNK> work into the broadway musical south pacific and would eventually make that into a movie as well not staying true to the original source he certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little <UNK> but otherwise <UNK> was wonderful educational experience about the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> america and japan at the time
<START> first of all when i saw the <UNK> trailer for wendy wu i was definitely excited brenda song one of the <UNK> girls on disney channel would be doing martial arts and i was fine with that until i saw the movie the action was poorly constructed the movie couldn't have <UNK> to anyone the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked along with the plot if you really think about it's a wannabe buffy the vampire <UNK> a girl who is the <UNK> of other warriors who were women a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become <UNK> queen the watcher who bug's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil the idea just wasn't all that original the movie is waste of time
<START> spoilers <UNK> is totally unrealistic lacks a plot and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when <UNK> <UNK> is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho this movie actually expected users to believe that <UNK> <UNK> character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many br br spoiler begins br br at the end the killer <UNK> his guts to <UNK> <UNK> long enough to allow <UNK> <UNK> character to run up and shoot him br br spoiler ends br br it is a little humorous only a little in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> oh sh t br br overall a <UNK> movie br br rating out of 2 out of 10
<START> i watched it subtitled as it was in russian but really enjoyed it the main character <UNK> was born cursed with a deadly weapon as an <UNK> of his body he lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things br br when <UNK> finally found love in a young woman named <UNK> everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle there was a fair amount of gore but not too much for the weak <UNK> br br not for people who like the regular old hollywood movie but for those who enjoy independent films kinda got the feeling of an asian fantasy film
<START> this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed the effects were pretty good i hear it was the most expensive korean film ever made being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money i rented it so i won't complain too much about what i paid but it was a couple hours that i'll never get back plot holes abound terrible acting all across the board i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie life is too short if your friends want to watch this run away i can't stress enough how bad this film was br br where the hell did the second dragon come from why didn't he show up sooner how did they have rocket <UNK> on dinosaurs just 500 years ago
<START> br br upon <UNK> my viewing of <UNK> or the eternal or whatever the producers are calling this film i wondered to myself out of all of the bad movies i could have seen couldn't i have at least seen one that was entertaining even if a film is not well made in terms of acting directing writing or what have you it can at least be fun and therefore worthwhile but not only is this film bad in artistic value it's incredibly boring for a plot of such <UNK> it moves awfully slowly with little dramatic tension at the very least in a low brow attempt at entertainment the deaths of the characters could have been cool and or gory but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well br br what does this movie have going for it pretty much nothing unless you get entertainment out of watching christopher walken who is capable of being brilliant put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self parody mode why did he decide to do this film anyway br br i give this film 3 10 because god help us there actually have been worse movies made before
<START> i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had it br br this movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you haven't then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointed br br the film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong br br the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a person's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of <UNK> <UNK> popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies too dark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadows it just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake there's just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial killer movie turns into some demonic supernatural monster movie at the end no thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy <UNK> people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an <UNK> photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible <UNK> and a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book well you just won't ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore you'll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away
<START> so being a fairly deep fan of horror movies it's been a while since i've seen one that really made me jump or <UNK> <UNK> br br definitely going to get this on dvd when it comes out a hell of a lot better than the ring the thing that i don't get is that so many people that we <UNK> with after the movie thought that it was horrible well if that's what you think then so be it i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared so i have to say that this one is worth watching br br now you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and <UNK> line because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story i think that if it was shown in <UNK> order it would have ruined the whole thing br br i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody <UNK> in it maybe the rest of you studio writers and <UNK> will realize that you don't have to <UNK> the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid
<START> brown of <UNK> is a hard movie to pin down we expect a lot more from our movies these days so it helps to remember that audiences in the <UNK> were a bit more innocent william haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and <UNK> to find success and even glory all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the <UNK> tie between billy and jack pickford the town nerd the movie has everything romance tears love death and even sports it's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century
<START> spoilers i rented <UNK> or <UNK> in english on the strength of director <UNK> <UNK> later effort the others based on what a brilliantly <UNK> and <UNK> effective <UNK> that film was i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror instead i wound up with the most tedious preposterous excuse for a lame <UNK> slasher movie i've seen since the german film <UNK> which this one kinda reminded me of br br the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes it revolves around innocent n pretty psychology student <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a jessica <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the subject of violence in films through some far fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here she winds up in possession of a <UNK> tape on which two men torture <UNK> and kill a young girl for the camera angela and her horror buff friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it br br this leads to well nothing br br they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers since they <UNK> refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events even when their own lives at risk and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls there is only one proper <UNK> the type of camera the killers used is discovered and that's a a really weak one and b <UNK> out in the first 20 minutes the rest of the so called <UNK> just occurs through blind luck increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are <UNK> in merely to pad out the running time br br seriously <UNK> might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life the key to a good <UNK> is to have a large <UNK> of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever <UNK> and the <UNK> discovery of more and more evidence before moving in for the final twist in <UNK> potential spoiler ahead the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur <UNK> almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying <UNK> to throw us off the <UNK> until he runs out of ideas throws his hands up and says ok ya got me it was him after all as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes no such luck you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after br br the only thing that drags <UNK> down further from just being a dumb badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous muddled up <UNK> about violence in films i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to <UNK> in a ton of misguided confused <UNK> in between the rest of the <UNK> and say look at me i'm political the final scenes in which the point of the movie is supposedly <UNK> home are so utterly absurd and <UNK> one can't help but wonder if <UNK> feels embarrassed now when he watches this if he doesn't he certainly should this is total <UNK> night at the slasher <UNK> stuff br br overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours it felt like at least six on this just hoping something might happen the urban legend of <UNK> <UNK> and that is basically all they are despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world is an area that can be so <UNK> exploited in good horror films <UNK> anyone but it's so easy to step over the line into <UNK> <UNK> it be cool if ' territory with it ie my little eye <UNK> hits an all time low for the <UNK> <UNK> genre on every level this one is better left dead and buried i'll award it a 1 out of 10 for some nice lighting but that's all it's getting
<START> although i bought the dvd when it first came out and have watched it several times i never wrote a review br br i loved it when i first saw it and i love it still br br sadly it seems it never made enough money to <UNK> anyone to do a follow up i have to assume <UNK> still controls the rights but after kill bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as my name is modesty with another tough female lead anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a let down br br peter <UNK> wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than action thrillers br br the <UNK> of <UNK> between modesty and <UNK> is very true to the source material and is tense suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn't have to have gore and explosions alexandra did a great job in playing how <UNK> character would have taken control of the situation br br i find this particularly ahead of the <UNK> following the sorely needed <UNK> of batman and james bond after 2 dismal earlier efforts although not nearly as well known to the public this is really a <UNK> of the modesty character and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made
<START> i have not seen this movie but i must having read all three of <UNK> <UNK> books <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i am <UNK> looking for a copy of this movie br br the <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> is alive and well considering that this crew had no <UNK> and only an old fashioned <UNK> tube radio with a 6 <UNK> <UNK> their voyage was heroic to say the least br br please <UNK> to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video br br i would be interested in buying it
<START> as a huge fan of horror films especially j horror and also gore i thought <UNK> <UNK> sounded pretty good i <UNK> the plot read reviews and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before <UNK> it so excited it had finished and ready to be scared and <UNK> in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed the plot was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and left too much unexplained the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying and what was with the cartoon style sound effects the acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it i did not understand the <UNK> idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light they left both pretty unexplained or perhaps i missed it as my mind couldn't understand what i was actually seeing i appreciate the way it was supposed to be shocking and a few scenes the strange <UNK> and own mother kissing certainly were i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion however it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value but don't be expecting a dark deeply scary and horrifying film you'll just be disappointed if this was a horror comedy spoof i'd probably rate it about a nine the climax being the weird scene when the husband <UNK> inside his wife's stomach and closed up her wounds but as a horror sadly i gave it a one
<START> this movie had it all action comedy <UNK> and best of all some of the finest actors gunga din will remain a classic to be enjoyed by all who like good movies excellent picture i have it in my collection
<START> this was in short a terrible disappointment by far the worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels the dialogue was horribly clumsy i could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters the lines were delivered too <UNK> and felt rather out of place they could just as well have been <UNK> by <UNK> the chemistry between george c scott and <UNK> york was non existent and watching an american rochester felt strange he could have at least tried to do a british accent i like george c scott as an actor but this simply did not work i felt like i was watching highlights from jane eyre where the main pieces of the story had been randomly put together with no regard to the flow of the story the scenery and music were all very nice but i could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between jane and rochester and the movie left me totally <UNK> br br if you want to see a good version of jane eyre i suggest you watch the 1983 bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke or the 1997 version with <UNK> <UNK> and samantha <UNK> now these two are brilliant adaptations
<START> i can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst laurel <UNK> for me it isn't as close to as bad as air raid <UNK> and the <UNK> but there are some definite huge flaws in it the film is set up to show laurel and hardy as the owners and <UNK> of the dance studio hardy is funny as the <UNK> lead of a london bridge dance surrounded by 20th century fox <UNK> while in the next room laurel teaches the <UNK> ballet while wearing a <UNK> outfit a clumsy carpenter <UNK> <UNK> on the floor leading to a <UNK> gag where hardy ends up the <UNK> then in come the <UNK> now selling insurance covering up their protection <UNK> one of them is a very young and handsome robert mitchum but no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance they are arrested br br this is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio the rest of the film is devoted to laurel and <UNK> support of wealthy <UNK> <UNK> marshall and her <UNK> boyfriend robert <UNK> they first try to help them hide their relationship from her <UNK> parents matt <UNK> and margaret <UNK> and hopeful <UNK> allan lane whom we can tell right off is a no good <UNK> this leads to <UNK> hidden bar being revealed to tea <UNK> <UNK> and a gag where a <UNK> is literally pulled out from the wealthy <UNK> which crashes his bed into a pond below when <UNK> uses the boys to help display his ray gun <UNK> ensues the dead pan butler <UNK> to case and <UNK> that their house is on fire br br later hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get laurel to break a leg to do so there is no reference to the fact that the insurance <UNK> were gangsters and that the policy would probably be <UNK> even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman after being arrested their <UNK> would have been <UNK> laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly <UNK> dog only a <UNK> covered cake <UNK> <UNK> look alike or possibly the actual <UNK> causing oliver to end up on a huge beach roller coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on perfectly fitting its <UNK> onto the tracks roller coaster gags can be exciting as <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> go to hollywood and this one is amusing but <UNK> br br as the story <UNK> up all of these gags seem to have no point giving the impression that this was simply a series of one <UNK> put together to make a full length feature hopefully part of a double bill l h as i've mentioned in other reviews of their later films had lost much of their <UNK> after leaving hal <UNK> employ but surprisingly here they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year had the gags not been as amusing as was the case with some of their other films this surely would have <UNK> a 2 as opposed to a 3
<START> they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat in the first cruel intentions we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel it's actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me it was as if they left out good writing in place of <UNK> f words and the end makes absolutely no sense and doesn't explain anything the writing was just terrible another thing that bothered me was that they used at <UNK> 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original such as down boy or the kissing scene and a few others i can't remember i was not impressed at all by <UNK> acting but amy did a great job that's about the only thing that <UNK> this movie
<START> i think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax what cinema goers made of this in the 30s i can only imagine the <UNK> said at the time 'a miracle has come to the screen ' watch it and marvel
<START> i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents i really connected it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate and then there's the mistakes they made and have to live with i loved ellen <UNK> performance and who is christine <UNK> she's fantastic a real find there is probably the most erotic scene i've ever seen in a film yet nothing was shown it was just so beautifully done overall the look and feel of the film was stunning a real emotional journey cole <UNK> is very very good in this picture he <UNK> a man <UNK> <UNK> i liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life never sentimental never too much just enough to hook us in but not enough to <UNK> down
<START> after finally watching walt disney's song of the south on <UNK> i decided to watch ralph bakshi's response to that movie <UNK> on <UNK> video which i linked from <UNK> video in this one during the live action sequences <UNK> charles <UNK> takes his friend <UNK> barry white with him to pick up <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and randy philip thomas years before he added michael for his middle name <UNK> as the latter two escape from prison during their attempt <UNK> tells randy a tale of brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear white and preacher fox <UNK> and their adventures in harlem as expected in many of these bakshi efforts there's a mix of animation and live action that provides a unique point of view from the writer director that is sure to offend some people another fascinating animated character is miss america who's a big as in gigantic in every way white blonde woman dressed in skin tight red white and blue stars and <UNK> who has a hold on a little black man and has him shot in one of the most sexually violent ways that was shockingly funny to me there are plenty of such scenes <UNK> throughout the picture of which another one concerning brother <UNK> frontal <UNK> also provided big laughs from me there's also a segment of a woman telling her baby of a <UNK> she was friends with who left her that was touching with that part seeming to be a tribute to the comic strip artist george <UNK> i was also fascinated hearing <UNK> washington jr 's version of ain't no sunshine heard as part of the score most compelling part of the picture was seeing the <UNK> himself depicted with his head in <UNK> during the opening credit sequence singing and <UNK> to a song that has him using the n word in a satirical way when i saw a vhs cover of this movie years ago it had depicted brother rabbit in <UNK> mode in front of what looked like the warner circles with the <UNK> this movie will offend everybody that is ample warning to anyone who thinks all cartoons are meant for children that said i definitely recommend <UNK> to fans of bakshi and of every form of animation
<START> i can watch a good gory film now and then i've seen some pretty sick stuff however this is one of the few films that i found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting i like gore films when they are fun i like <UNK> they are a lot of creativity behind them the gore in this film is not creative it is sick it is <UNK> it is completely unpleasant because of this this film is certainly not entertaining the film is a horror film but it lacks scares so pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film and that's saying a lot the acting is terrible the plot makes no sense and the music is really annoying and way too electronic sounding it all took me right out of the film pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal there's this guy that has a freak accident in a <UNK> and <UNK> in a hospital to find that his skin is <UNK> and melting off i guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process there's some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog some <UNK> head floating down a stream and an ending involving a man being <UNK> there were times where i tried really hard to enjoy it but the only scene in the whole film that i thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital <UNK> in slow motion if you like ugly nasty ad unappealing horror films this one is for you
<START> scott <UNK> <UNK> is nine minutes of pure <UNK> it is a full frontal assault of psychedelic <UNK> <UNK> inducing flashing lights and colours and the first true <UNK> of film and video in <UNK> garde cinema there's no story to speak of but <UNK> uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to <UNK> a sequence of emotional reactions <UNK> these <UNK> <UNK> into the highly industrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the <UNK> of humanity into his tools his <UNK> his technology this theme <UNK> loosely with the subplot of <UNK> in stanley kubrick's <UNK> a space odyssey 1968 ' and indeed <UNK> opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a close up human eye  recalls dave <UNK> journey through the stargate the visuals are richly <UNK> a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasingly grainy video as though we're sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv <UNK> br br there appears to be some confusion about the film's release date imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film <UNK> and the national film <UNK> foundation give 1968 as the correct year perhaps this <UNK> reflects the time between the film's <UNK> and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some <UNK> <UNK> music wouldn't have gone <UNK> either <UNK> captures grainy <UNK> images presenting life from the <UNK> perspective of a computer <UNK> too much information i had a thought  and please don't laugh at this free thinking interpretation  that an <UNK> <UNK> capturing <UNK> television <UNK> might very well receive such a disjointed alien <UNK> of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguely familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an <UNK> <UNK> of film and video of <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> convoluted <UNK> and implausible fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it she's at once touching funny cunning the supporting actors commit to it as well br br i wont even try to tell you the plot it involves characters from hartley's henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage br br the film works well if you continue along with it understanding it is in a sense completely ridiculous it becomes more and more ridiculous as you <UNK> along i <UNK> the temptation to turn off the dvd twice br br fay grim requires an adventurous film goer willing to tackle something that isn't cookie cutter in the end it offers something that defies description
<START> women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in <UNK> film <UNK> although <UNK> cut here and there might help the film it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense mark from <UNK> <UNK> latest films 5 different women are <UNK> with their male partners and families beginning with several different stories bound to meet as the plot goes on <UNK> <UNK> his women characters in the same neurotic and border line behaviour familiar to <UNK> a <UNK> high society lady with a <UNK> to smaller shoes a <UNK> house <UNK> taking care of her disabled daughter a drug addict dancer obsessed with her former boyfriend and a taxi driver taking care of her late husband's disturbed kids all <UNK> the streets of <UNK> in well designed scenes using some of <UNK> familiar actresses the director succeeds in it's first film to give depth to all the characters sharing the film and to create genuine sympathy with each of them the women controls the plot line and the men are bound to be left with each other eventually surprisingly good for a first film and worth the time in any standard it is noticeable that <UNK> <UNK> in some needed <UNK> to the actresses but an <UNK> act is shown anyway on the screen especially by monica <UNK> which played in his former short film br br a must to all <UNK> fans and enjoyable to all
<START> the <UNK> is one of those independent productions made by obvious <UNK> but it doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films it has a definite story it has adequate acting the photography is very good the hero and the bad guy are both <UNK> men and the background music isn't overdone this is a dvd new release so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile i don't know where all the <UNK> come from as there's no way this film is that good even if you're the <UNK> mother br br the last film we saw at a theater was <UNK> <UNK> of j k <UNK> much loved and excellent book order of the phoenix in comparing the <UNK> with phoenix consider that phoenix as made by <UNK> had no story certainly no acting was allowed by the director the photography was dreadful and the wall of sound overbearing musical score was just a mess i rated phoenix a 1 because the scale doesn't go any lower the <UNK> is 4 times better in all regards br br if you have the opportunity give the <UNK> a chance remember this isn't <UNK> 3 the shootout or any such nonsense it's original if your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish 10 scores here you might just enjoy the film on its own terms
<START> this documentary explores a story covered in <UNK> latest book freedom next time which was published in 2006 it reveals the shocking <UNK> of the natives of diego garcia one of the <UNK> islands in the indian ocean br br the <UNK> are technically british citizens as diego garcia is a british colony much like <UNK> the nearby island to where the natives were <UNK> used to be but the british government has ignored their <UNK> to return to their <UNK> as the island is now a military base for the united states army who have used it as a basis for the bombing of iraq and afghanistan br br as usual <UNK> coverage is shocking especially as he documents the treatment and the current <UNK> living conditions of the surviving <UNK> his interviews all round are excellent and his <UNK> of a <UNK> representative where he uses the <UNK> own information to pin him down ranks as one of his best br br <UNK> also uses dramatic <UNK> to <UNK> a series of recently released documents that fully <UNK> the british conspiracy to <UNK> the natives the <UNK> of this footage with the interviews and the <UNK> music really <UNK> the film's impact br br it is not easy viewing but stealing a nation is john <UNK> at his best recommended
<START> star pickford and director <UNK> along with his two favorite <UNK> and assistant clarence brown doing the editing bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor isolated scottish <UNK> the same territory that michael powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success visions of wind and wave <UNK> <UNK> of lovers do not merely <UNK> the story they are the story of struggle against <UNK> br br the actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan <UNK> between comedy and <UNK> here with her father's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to church there <UNK> with her <UNK> walking stick in her hand like a <UNK> discussing her lover played by matt moore br br see if you can pick out future star <UNK> joy in the ensemble i tried but failed
<START> for months <UNK> the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media so i <UNK> waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about after it was over i had to apologize to my roommate for <UNK> the vcr for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie it essentially fails because it is a character based movie about <UNK> characters with the possible exception of amanda <UNK> whose only <UNK> quality is that she is amanda <UNK> you cannot stand any of them the film relies on its dialogue which is <UNK> moronic and crude the only slightly amusing character is eric whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on the final twist designed to make you laugh at the three main characters only instead <UNK> the same kind of <UNK> towards <UNK> all in all only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor
<START> i watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed br br heather graham and tom <UNK> basically had to carry this <UNK> unbelievable script for five hours or however long it actually was from the beginning every single element of this movie is unbelievable this movie made me chuckle several times but they were mainly out of shock that the director writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together br br the movie's focus is gray graham and her issues with <UNK> things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly way too much in common br br interesting intriguing however instead of <UNK> this story into something believable and <UNK> the director keeps taking gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all being an <UNK> individual this movie seemed to echo what all <UNK> think we go through in the coming out process i'll be insulted if the writer's <UNK> had it not been for the cute chemistry between <UNK> and graham which by the way was understandably forced i would give it a negative 3 stars
<START> dan <UNK> has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern israel br br for anyone who's ever been in love the film brings back the <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> that make love so bitter sweet the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to <UNK> the feeling instantly you are drawn in to <UNK> plight and you can't fail to be deeply moved br br you can't write drama and passion like this the contrast between the realities of <UNK> desperate <UNK> relationship with <UNK> and the realities of a state in turmoil make this <UNK> watchable if you have an ounce of passion and have ever been in love see this film
<START> after a lively if predictable opening bank heist scene <UNK> it <UNK> <UNK> straight into the <UNK> and continues to sink this is a movie that deals in nasty <UNK> stereotypes instead of characters preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting and a hideous cocktail of <UNK> sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought wit or feeling in short it's no different from 90 of hollywood product but it's the racial angle that makes <UNK> it <UNK> a particularly <UNK> example of contemporary film making posing as a celebration of <UNK> the film is actually a celebration of the most <UNK> forms of <UNK> <UNK> american <UNK> stereotype the gimmick this time is that the <UNK> are wearing drag not only does the film suggest that <UNK> is a <UNK> identity for all african americans <UNK> for cash or feeling a bit <UNK> by the man it presents its <UNK> as shallow <UNK> who prize money and <UNK> above all else worse <UNK> it <UNK> exploits the theme of racial <UNK> and <UNK> simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure serious race related social issues are <UNK> on in contrived and <UNK> fashion in order to justify armed robbery then they're <UNK> as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is <UNK> the <UNK> turns out to be a bunch of caring guilt ridden <UNK> tell that to rodney king and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> smith follows the path of <UNK> <UNK> out of the <UNK> and into a world of middle class self <UNK> opened up for her by her <UNK> bank manager boyfriend <UNK> it <UNK> illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary <UNK> film <UNK> to mindless <UNK> stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the <UNK> while all the time <UNK> it while the likes of <UNK> and <UNK> in the 1970s might have <UNK> stereotypes and <UNK> well worn plots they had a <UNK> an energy and an innocence that struck a <UNK> with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch <UNK> it <UNK> wouldn't be worth getting angry over if wasn't a <UNK> of the tragic decline and <UNK> of african american film making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s
<START> in addition to his tarzan series the prolific edgar rice <UNK> did write many other books although aside from the popular at the <UNK> core few of these have been filmed one exception is the novel entitled the <UNK> and the lion brought to the screen as the lion man 1936 an over <UNK> static old hat slow moving and rather dull movie despite being filmed on real desert locations actually movie is the wrong word the narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a <UNK> pace in an abrupt series of <UNK> for instance at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear even more frustrating for the keen movie fan are the characters who make an impression of sorts like the <UNK> who <UNK> hall with drugged wine but are <UNK> by players who are not credited the credited <UNK> generally come off worse than the <UNK> one exception is australian actress <UNK> barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped <UNK> girl who <UNK> young master fairy admittedly most of the cast are <UNK> with atrocious king james dialogue which has to be heard to be believed but the way to play this rubbish is tongue in cheek a <UNK> which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's <UNK> of no talent players maybe director j p mccarthy <UNK> that idea anyway it's sad to see the lovely kathleen burke forced to trade lines with the likes of richard <UNK> her dad and jon hall her <UNK> admittedly mr hall delivers his lines with <UNK> more conviction than mr <UNK> but that is no recommendation
<START> other <UNK> have detailed the plot and the social <UNK> and commentary as well or better that i could but i would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film it holds up very well indeed more that 50 years later in every category screenplay acting photography set design sound design it really is a classic of sorts this was my first exposure to the young alec guinness and it's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a <UNK> br br i only rate it an 8 because it's essentially a rather lightweight <UNK> that <UNK> human nature but doesn't really <UNK> it and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end rather than actually <UNK> conflict between the <UNK> and the mill workers and <UNK> who are chasing him all over town also a couple minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay wear and tear is hardly ever the <UNK> factor in buying new clothes especially dress clothes children grow up people change <UNK> gain and lose weight and go with the latest fashions all the time and have as long as <UNK> have woven cloth and if nothing else the <UNK> would make a fortune providing <UNK> material for military uniforms especially <UNK> br br still this is a great film if you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel you should
<START> of all the british <UNK> movies like four <UNK> charge of the light <UNK> for example this movie stands out as the cream of the crop it reflects a time when the sun never set on the british empire get over it i won't go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that makes this film great i have visited the <UNK> hills and have photographed the pass through which the british <UNK> and it remains as it was <UNK> by time and <UNK> by man and <UNK> and even though i know it's coming seeing din lying dead on a <UNK> and when these lines are read br br yes din din din br br you <UNK> leather gunga din br br though i've <UNK> you and <UNK> you br br by the <UNK> <UNK> that made you br br you're a better man than i am gunga din br br i still at <UNK> years of age get misty eyed and anyone who says they don't is a liar the range of emotions within it is the mark of a great movie like the ending of another great film of mice and men
<START> saw this movie at the <UNK> film festival and thought it was deadly smart stylish and funny br br the cast was rock solid great work by carrie anne moss dylan baker tim blake nelson billy <UNK> and up and <UNK> <UNK> fast br br <UNK> i found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it br br writers dennis <UNK> robert <UNK> and andrew <UNK> layered in a lot of political subtext but didn't <UNK> you over the head with it br br the world they created had depth and made sense there is a <UNK> <UNK> spirit to this movie br br fido is guaranteed to cure <UNK> br br loved it
<START> why br br that simple question had to be on the lips of every single new <UNK> during the 12 months of terror that david <UNK> created in 1976 <UNK> that same one word will surely become the same <UNK> question 22 <UNK> later as people exit theaters <UNK> the trite and exploitative summer of sam br br director spike lee attempts to <UNK> the story of a pack of misguided thugs searching for the celebrated psychopath who <UNK> new york city for over a year with a stark and <UNK> depiction of the killings the demons inside <UNK> head and the frustration of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he presents an ensemble of despicable losers who hear their own <UNK> dogs as they live lives devoid of love honor and humanity no different than <UNK> lee <UNK> the audience in nearly every frame with not one of us are what we seem to be often a critic of the white establishment lee <UNK> the stereotype by including a scene where mira sorvino playing a <UNK> with a cheating husband john <UNK> hopes to have <UNK> sex with a black man in the back of a big black <UNK> an italian <UNK> tells a black detective that the famous willie <UNK> over the back center field catch was lucky lee even makes sure to deliver the racist <UNK> of one middle aged black woman who declares i'm happy it's a white man killing all these white people because if it were a black man killing all these white people there would be the biggest race riot in nyc history br br other than an outstanding opening pan shot of an arrival at a disco reminiscent of shots from martin <UNK> <UNK> or orson welles' the third man this film has no soul purpose or passion he <UNK> characters on the screen <UNK> of human decency although we learn nothing about the true victims of this horrible spree spike lee seems to be saying new york city got what it deserved during that frightening <UNK> summer over two decades ago br br how could anyone <UNK> such havoc on his beloved city how could someone show such hatred toward his fellow man br br are these appropriate questions for <UNK> or lee br br you decide
<START> i missed the beginning but i did see most of it a friend got it on dvd in the cheap room at <UNK> br br the skits are all very short and yet most of them are still too long the majority of them they seem to have forgotten to have something funny quite a lot of racist sexist <UNK> humor in it skits based on stereotypes or skits which use racist terms for people br br i'm trying to remember anything i thought was funny in it and i'm having trouble the <UNK> for the tunnel vision network is a <UNK> mouth with an <UNK> in it the mouth opens and <UNK> over the eye like <UNK> kind of creepy br br what a disappointment most of the actors went on to better things and it's lucky this bomb didn't hold them back
<START> films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning while there are some exceptions the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes the kids in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them in short they're rubbish this isn't good considering that they're the leads and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors it's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't not completely it follows a young girl who after drawing a picture of a house in her <UNK> wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created it soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings and so sets about making various changes until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare oh dear br br as you can see this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie however it is <UNK> through a number of fatal faults first and foremost in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of <UNK> the movie is extremely stale the central plot is hardly played with at all and the result is an entirely boring experience the lack of tension is another huge <UNK> flaw in the movie as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more which is due to a lack of ideas thanks in part to it's lead characters the film feels like a kids movie throughout this is to be expected as it stars kids but bernard rose should have decided the <UNK> that he wanted to put on the story as the horror in the movie is laughable at best the film is also very cheesy and the <UNK> between the two leads is extremely cringe worthy and makes for very painful viewing in fact if i had to sum this travesty up in one word i would choose <UNK> paperhouse is poorly acted laughably plotted very corny and dull on the whole save yourself the pain see something else
<START> this is a complex film that explores the effects of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of industrial <UNK> production on human relations there are constant references to <UNK> line production where workers are treated as <UNK> in a machine <UNK> by <UNK> wielding <UNK> controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed and firing workers stanley who meet all <UNK> as his <UNK> says are always on time are hard workers do good work but who may in some <UNK> future make a mistake br br this system destroys families stanley has to send his father to a <UNK> home where he quickly dies after stanley loses his job <UNK> daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant references are made to the fact that now with <UNK> <UNK> both partners need to work the <UNK> being that there's nobody left at home to care for the kids <UNK> husband is dead from an illness and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more <UNK> care <UNK> brother in law gets abusive after yet another <UNK> day at the <UNK> office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her <UNK> instead of leaving it for her face lift and or teeth job even the working class with no stake in conventional <UNK> notions of perfection and beauty buy into them the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail presumably he's also black and black men suffer <UNK> high <UNK> rates she remarks that he like her is doing time her family is composed of a prisoner and a <UNK> slave br br stanley however still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of <UNK> capitalism he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his <UNK> he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely <UNK> contract as <UNK> brother in law does suggesting that he married the wrong sister he does not as <UNK> says <UNK> to the work eat sleep routine of everyone else rather he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an <UNK> and creative way in a sort of <UNK> ideal this was the dream of early <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> such as the <UNK> to use technology to provide for all basic needs allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations he is also outside of traditional gender relations he <UNK> he <UNK> he cares for his family and he knows how to iron <UNK> on the other hand lives in a <UNK> male role she's a factory worker the <UNK> source of <UNK> for her extended family and she brings stanley into the public realm <UNK> off limits to women by teaching him to read and write she gives him access to the world of knowledge also <UNK> <UNK> male br br <UNK> here is used as a metaphor for the <UNK> <UNK> public realm and the systems of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cultural that <UNK> participation in the public realm without this access stanley is <UNK> the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning he is <UNK> from all regular <UNK> unable to participate in the <UNK> can't open a bank account in the <UNK> can't get a <UNK> license can't ride the bus and in the social he asks if he exists if he can't write his name br br after learning to read he grabs books on auto <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the bible the word of god is therefore <UNK> placed on the same value plane as how to books in fact organized religion in general is only very occasionally present the bible also appears on a <UNK> as the camera pans to find stanley and <UNK> having sex it is however acknowledged as a moral force <UNK> clearly a character devoted to living a good life mentions at the beginning of the film that her <UNK> was among the objects lost in a purse <UNK> br br once able to read he enters the system and lands a <UNK> position with a health care plan a car and a house taking his place at the head of the family the <UNK> presumably he's an industrial designer dreaming up products that will require others enduring the <UNK> of the <UNK> line to produce this ending probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film is so <UNK> with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasn't forced in by some studio <UNK> suddenly worried about the lack of a feel good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line br br now that according to the <UNK> we've <UNK> moved on to post industrial capitalism the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period br br nevertheless it's highly recommended at least if you want to exercise your brain disregard the ending and it's close to a perfect 10
<START> for a while i was caught in the trap where i found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that i liked them <UNK> drives the bus is the exception it is the truth it is the best bad movie ever br br the badness of this movie seems to come naturally halfway through <UNK> opening monologue the word hell appears at the bottom of the screen the glamorous bridget is an <UNK> man in a wig and a <UNK> store dress it takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs jesus walks to a <UNK> soundtrack br br anyways <UNK> gives the impression that someone lost their <UNK> for <UNK> a <UNK> film project but it's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful you get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad but never forced it br br never to be <UNK> in wonder <UNK> delivers highly highly recommended
<START> as essential a part of british pop culture as the monty python and james bond doctor who was a massive hit for 26 years 1963 1989 making it one of the longest running tv shows in the world most serials are lucky to have ten seasons plans to <UNK> the series were always on the <UNK> agenda and after a <UNK> not to mention <UNK> tv movie produced by fox failed to capture the magic of the original version another nine years comic relief spoof and animated mini series notwithstanding were required before the ultimate time lord could return properly courtesy of acclaimed writer russell t davies br br <UNK> brilliance in <UNK> the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an <UNK> rose tyler <UNK> <UNK> a london based girl who leads a very normal life until one night she is attacked by creatures made out of living plastic she is rescued by an <UNK> stranger who introduces himself simply as the doctor christopher <UNK> and then disappears after <UNK> nice to meet you rose run for your life as she gets more and more curious about this man she soon finds herself in a whole new world aliens <UNK> travel through time and space and of course the <UNK> police box shaped <UNK> br br the first 45 minutes of the new doctor who are almost perfect the special effects could have used a bit more <UNK> because davies nails two things the show's unique humor and the two protagonists the original <UNK> most endearing <UNK> was its blend of spectacular sci fi and pure british comedy a hybrid that's hard if not impossible to <UNK> here the laughs are all linked to the conversations between rose and the doctor who come off as fully rounded characters after just one episode okay so technically <UNK> doctor is the <UNK> to use that name but he <UNK> himself from the previous eight <UNK> by speaking with a northern accent the one he uses on a daily basis and <UNK> it with a terrific line lots of planets have a north br br the real triumph of this episode though is <UNK> performance in theory rose is in her late teens therefore nearly the same age as thousands of young viewers who had never heard of the doctor before her portrayal of an ordinary girl lost in a new exciting universe represents the new <UNK> reaction to the return of a tv icon and the chemistry that instantly forms between her and <UNK> is a sign <UNK> the new doctor who is just as good as the old one br br first fifth <UNK> it makes no difference there may have been others before <UNK> and <UNK> for that matter but together he william <UNK> peter <UNK> and the rest of the bunch are one single character one so cool he doesn't even need a name he's the doctor

<START> ok so i am an original wicker man fan and i usually don't like british films remade by americans so why oh why did i put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever i am not a nicolas cage fan and i had some kind of moment of madness perhaps the film was appalling the bit at the beginning with the crash fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where edward was going so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the <UNK> well it wouldn't have happened as the whole thing would have been <UNK> the history behind the wicker man wasn't really explored and i guess being set in america didn't really help the whole <UNK> theme this film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense i must say that the best bit was right at the end when nicolas cage goes up in flames i am in such desperate need to see the original again now in order to <UNK> my disappointed soul i really can't stress how disappointing this film is please don't see it if you br br a don't like american re makes of british films b are a fan of the original c hate nicolas cage
<START> i own ralph <UNK> forgotten masterpiece fire ice on an old <UNK> rental <UNK> br br well for one thing this is better than any other conan <UNK> film you'll ever see sure it's cheesy but who cares it stood the test of time and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like lotr <UNK> though i love that film br br the plot goes like this after a battle between fire ice a kings daughter is kidnapped by <UNK> ice <UNK> creatures while a sole survivor of a <UNK> village <UNK> her br br yeah it doesn't sound as a original as nurse betty but that's not the point it is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies fire ice and it succeeds br br as for the action scenes superb they are well handled have terrific <UNK> and have plenty of loud noises just check out the climatic battle now that's an ending br br the acting and dialogue competent really they aren't gonna be nominated for an oscar but they are ok and don't get on your nerves br br the animation is quite good shot on 3d and <UNK> i think it looks pretty good a lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn and although the character designs feel a little 1 <UNK> they are ok br br overall this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the <UNK> entertainment 10 10
<START> story of a good for nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music director danny boyle has lost none of his <UNK> for <UNK> in the <UNK> of humanity for characters but he has lost in this film the edge for creating inspiring and funny films <UNK> is painful to watch and barely justified by the fact that it was made for tv

<START> judging by some of the comments in imdb i was expecting an action movie perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a <UNK> one but essentially an action movie br br whatever it is that i watched it certainly didn't feel like a movie the story is simple and straightforward even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated take three interest groups 1 the government 2 the rebels 3 a group of <UNK> br br now <UNK> the first they never appear in the movie then simply let one of the <UNK> the princess become a rogue on a revenge trip add in a rebel love interest with a guilty conscience and you've got the ingredients br br but they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be sci fi on a low budget what you're left with is a feeling of <UNK> the movie just does not feel like a movie but a weird incoherent boring dream br br avoid br br 2 10
<START> odd slasher movie from producer charles band in the days of full <UNK> greatest success band said that he would never make real killer films because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better people killing each other is thus real and less fun a nice philosophy and a true shame that band having destroyed the full moon studio through possible shoddy business <UNK> became so desperate for home cinema <UNK> that he started making exactly what the likes of blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality the team behind this one also worked on <UNK> <UNK> die ' and <UNK> <UNK> both equally bland by full moon standards debbie <UNK> is on usual top form here as a <UNK> to a gang of <UNK> and <UNK> who decide to make up a story about a <UNK> <UNK> she as one would obviously does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly ms <UNK> believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not the choice is there's and with regard to this movie its yours not recommended but not entirely bad either
<START> to say this film is simply a <UNK> of <UNK> and a <UNK> of history is untrue that is not what this film is br br what this film is is a comment on the <UNK> of the church although this could be <UNK> for any powerful body the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon to label this as propaganda against <UNK> seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be <UNK> yes we should comment on the <UNK> committed by other <UNK> but that is not for the <UNK> of this film br br it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching <UNK> we do not study the past we are bound to repeat <UNK>
<START> didn't know anything about the movie before watching and i think it was the no expectation factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than i anticipated br br the setting was interesting strange but interesting the storyline had gaps jumps that i think throws the audience off a bit there's no great soundtrack playing in the background creating the romantic ambiance but they all didn't matter br br the chemistry between emma and luis was simply exquisite there was some inexplicable strange chemistry that i couldn't resist i fell in love with it and here i am writing this review the subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb and i believe that is the core of this movie br br this movie is not an everyday romantic comedy in fact not all of us will appreciate it i had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things i didn't catch at first i cannot guarantee everyone will like it but i hope you do
<START> hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr sebastian caine kevin bacon finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla it works perfectly caine his team of <UNK> celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military <UNK> caine wants to be the first invisible human he manages to <UNK> his team to help him the <UNK> works well caine becomes invisible however when they try to bring him back the serum fails he remain invisible the team desperately search for an <UNK> but nothing works caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory but then again he's invisible right he can do anything he wants br br directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man you know it's just after christmas i saw this a few hours ago on late night early morning cable tv worst of all i feel sick not because of the film but because of the <UNK> <UNK> pop i've had over the past week so i'll keep this one brief the script by andrew w <UNK> has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle has a good central premise it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man 1933 film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror sci fi action provide good entertainment value for <UNK> odd minutes i thought the character's were ok i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it's generally known that verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually <UNK> one of his team then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification <UNK> going to <UNK> that caine says to himself then of course there's the gore he shows a rat being torn apart that's just the opening scene after the credits to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty sadistic tone about it having said that i love horror gore exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea br br director verhoeven does a great job or should that be the special effects boys make him look good the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular more or less flawless their brilliant it's as simple straight forward as that there's some good horror action set pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over the top i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one <UNK> at a time complete with <UNK> organs bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla there's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten someone is <UNK> on a spike someone has their head <UNK> open with blood <UNK> results br br with a <UNK> budget of about 95 000 000 hollow man is technically <UNK> i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects <UNK> says they <UNK> <UNK> entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his <UNK> were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they the acting was ok bacon made for a good mad scientist anti hero type guy br br hollow man is one of <UNK> big budget <UNK> <UNK> where the effects action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film well i know i do good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly <UNK> darker streak than the usual hollywood product definitely worth a watch
<START> i too have gone thru very painful personal loss twice and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well life out of balance nothing makes sense well meaning relatives etc br br it was nice to see ally again she is one of my all time favorite movie actors br br i laughed and cried as the story <UNK> great story and cast well done
<START> here's a horror version of <UNK> queen of the desert they wish starring melinda <UNK> return of the living dead 3 clarke as candy a desert <UNK> who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend johnny jason <UNK> he ends up in a south of the border prison run by the sadistic chief screw an overacting robert englund in a <UNK> she and her beloved pet <UNK> end up in hiding at a gas station convent until they're transformed by a newly fallen meteor the dogs turn into obnoxious drag queen <UNK> and candy develops a very long talking killing <UNK> tongue she can't control thugs looking for the stolen <UNK> and other <UNK> <UNK> add extra complications br br first off clarke is fantastic and makes what there is to make of this movie you watch her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes very convincing during the horror scenes and very sexy in various <UNK> and <UNK> including an eye popping skin tight <UNK> <UNK> and wonder how come this actress isn't a huge star it's too bad the rest of this cult attempt doesn't live up to her promise br br blame director <UNK> <UNK> who thinks the outlandish premise alone is enough to sustain laughs but his vulgar gags annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor another nail in the coffin the film looks cheap lots of <UNK> colors and sets are strangely muted by <UNK> photography and the dusty desert locales luckily for <UNK> that clarke is in his film because she alone keeps you watching
<START> this is possibly the best short crime drama i've ever seen the acting is superb especially amanda burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some she does an amazing job <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british tv film the ending which i'm not going to give away is fantastic mainly because you don't really get one you'll get what i mean after you've seen it this is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not touched by this you're one cold hearted person
<START> this movie is one of the best ever produced by disney br br the plot is very original and entertaining the animated sequence is also very well done with the live actors for the time br br perhaps one of my favorite sequences is contained in this movie with the march of the suits of armor
<START> according to this board i guess either you love it or hate it usually how it goes with all movies there is no need to get <UNK> with others though all we are doing here is giving opinions i rented this movie last night and i want to come and throw my opinion in the mix i was surprised by how many people are <UNK> it though there's a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan i'm a horror movie fan most plain <UNK> movie fans don't like horror movies so many low budget <UNK> <UNK> looking movies are coming out these days it's hard to keep up and what makes it tough to stay into these movies is how bad they are i wanted to come and write a review about hood of the living dead because it's pretty damn good compared to the rest of the junk out there it's nothing special but it's those horror film makers that try to be too serious that end up making a horrible horror film i really liked this one you telling me there is no effort in this one and one more thing i bet all of you have all of these huge dvd <UNK> that you are so proud of nothing but major motion pictures right nothing wrong with that but you have to know how to appreciate low budget independent i knew what i was getting when i watched this movie i'm not going to be upset because i thought it was going to be some 100 million dollar movie some of you might need to stick with watching the matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything to the matrix and if most of you are under 24 that explains everything good movie folks check it out
<START> the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our <UNK> get their <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> so the basic idea is the police <UNK> these gangsters by like a million to one but they're <UNK> because the <UNK> guns are just a bit bigger i guess police <UNK> just kinda <UNK> of they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously what is wrong with these guys they're talking like they were armed with rolled up <UNK> okay i admit it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire even when the situation is so much to your advantage but don't go nuts and why the hell did it take <UNK> minutes to solve everything anyway i'd say that's a very long time when you have them surrounded and you're allowed to shoot they're like ten <UNK> away they hit absolutely nothing then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their <UNK> and then yeah there you have it one of the cops actually hits someone bullet was probably <UNK> by a <UNK> post or something i had a good laugh i guess
<START> in my opinion this is the best stand up show i have ever seen i became an instant eddie fan after seeing dress to kill but i must say i think this is his best work i would say though if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live it is worth it br br most of the time after seeing a stand up routine a couple times the jokes start to get old but i have to say i've seen this show so many times that i literally have the entire thing <UNK> which yes i realize is kinda sad but every joke still makes me laugh this is truly a feel good show br br dress to kill will never get old for me i own it and watch it anytime i need a good laugh
<START> i agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog and i wasn't impressed right after i watched it however after a few days i realized that the movie stays with me and it evokes a melancholy mood which <UNK> in my mind my appreciation of this movie <UNK> it certainly merits a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly forgettable br br as many have commented the movie is non linear and that's a hallmark of european film making as opposed to the linear narrative form that hollywood <UNK> i don't really know whether it's true or not many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations to those viewers i don't think there is much i can say to change their opinions however for others who have yet to see the film do expect to be challenged and don't expect the film to supply all the answers and you might come away enjoying it more than you would otherwise br br the movie <UNK> around a bit but really chronicles just 3 time periods pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods it is also not as confusing as suggested just enjoy and it'll all be clear at the end br br yes lots of things are left <UNK> or not shown and lots of situations are left <UNK> but isn't that what life is like a lot of time you're not sure of the motives of your friends loved ones unless you confront them and even then you can never be 100 sure if they told you the whole truth this type of movies forces us to interpret the reasons behind the actions the movie does however leave enough hints for you to make some reasonable <UNK> for example mathieu is manic <UNK> to the point of <UNK> why i don't know maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it maybe he misses his family but hasn't forgiven his father for <UNK> his sick mother at her hours of need maybe after all he sacrifices for cedric <UNK> and indeed shattering his life to be with him he realizes that it is all coming <UNK> i think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off mentality fragile by that scene w the dead bird maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these <UNK> are taking a <UNK> on him but we're also shown that he is not some animal torturing psycho by his loving interaction w the stray cat also there is one conversation between the doctor and cedric that <UNK> light on the reason behind the <UNK> and maybe the suicide attempt the doctor asks him if everything is okay and cedric thinks so even though he cheated on mathieu once but that's nothing according to cedric is that the only reason we don't know there are probably others all mixed up together is it paramount that we know exactly what they are i don't think so for this movie another <UNK> sign that they are ultimately not <UNK> is the historical ruins scene mathieu is interested in studying the ruins cedric is not he is the one w the raging <UNK> who focuses only on the physical side without an intellectual side that mathieu obviously needs br br finally the ending is really rather hopeful and sweet i was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the end br br i have two complaints for the dvd one is the sound it's very soft i had to <UNK> up the volume to hear the dialog and then when it switched to a bar or <UNK> crowd scene it became too loud the other is that the subtitles can't be turn off they stay on the screen most foreign movie dvds not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately
<START> this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is i think a story of a rebellious college basketball player his tough but fair coach his girlfriend and a fellow student played by michael <UNK> who has <UNK> nervous <UNK> the story goes nowhere there is zero character development there is nobody to care about and the performances with the exception of bruce dern as the coach are terrible it is hard to believe how a talent like jack nicholson could direct such an awful movie make sure to avoid this turkey
<START> i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there the sound effects and audio are amazing there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover <UNK> to blast your <UNK> with even more magic the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really <UNK> and afraid of what might <UNK> around the next corner or what might jump out behind you if you want to get the full experience try playing it with head phones on
<START> i was brought up on doc savage and was <UNK> by the green death as a child but even then as now i found it thoroughly entertaining i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions granted they mostly think i'm odd but there you are i don't know what it is about the doc but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre and was way before it's time it is not to be taken seriously move over austin powers ron <UNK> is a god it is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk i don't think it should be remade and <UNK> like i said it's a classic it cannot be done without ron like the italian job without <UNK> and michael caine i give it 10 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> russo was one very fortunate lady many years ago she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of <UNK> money her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a <UNK> for the <UNK> ones on her property grounds <UNK> also raised two <UNK> in her home to be more like children they dressed in clothes and had many <UNK> one day she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the <UNK> life once out of danger <UNK> decides she will raise the gorilla also as one of her children this works well for years and buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home but buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous will <UNK> be able to keep buddy under control for those who love animals buddy is a must see movie based on a true story <UNK> and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the <UNK> of animal history and <UNK> of course buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in the film but he is very close to seeming totally real russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice the costumes are <UNK> as <UNK> the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding but most importantly animals are here in abundance not only buddy but the adorable <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> and so forth for those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice all animal lovers and even those who just want to watch a great family film will go ape over buddy
<START> i feel blessed to own what is known as the worst steven seagal movie ever made i knew i was on to something special when steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out by the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and i was almost falling out of my chair with <UNK> laughter br br steven is steven with an ever changing voice and totally unbelievable in his role as always who the hell lets people with bad <UNK> hair <UNK> tail <UNK> into the forces anyway he also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior the supporting actors all look like they've been shot in the dark btw did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a <UNK> torch for lighting br br this is truly <UNK> in every way possible invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it this one's truly special
<START> spoiler i love branagh love helena bonham carter loved them together in mary <UNK> frankenstein but this br br i can understand an actor's desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype well they did but really the script <UNK> on bonham <UNK> clothes were <UNK> <UNK> and the occasional <UNK> up <UNK> sequence could have been an <UNK> from a <UNK> movie or the old <UNK> and martin laugh in br br i never got the point other <UNK> say the branagh character was a <UNK> i never felt that he was a loser and not very bright and certainly not endearing the business with the bank <UNK> disguise was merely painful to watch certainly not amusing br br bonham <UNK> realistic one <UNK> attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of <UNK> accent in full monty br br the poetic ending with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too <UNK> was there a choir of angels or merely a soundtrack br br go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it <UNK> this to <UNK> br br
<START> dear richard i know we all loved you on home improvement with tim allen but seriously do you not have anything else to do besides lame sequels to air bud i would have thought tim might have actually give you a bit role by now or even becoming his personal assistant i know that seems ironic but the pay benefits are much more rewarding br br everybody would see you around tim and instantly think tool time you would even get roles with bob <UNK> more often instead you appear for 10 minutes with a golden <UNK> and smiling i know there wasn't much of a script but you could have added to it i mean come on tim owes you one br br but seriously this movie does nothing for the air bud line quite the contrary the fake talking <UNK> are <UNK> than actually seeing the dogs play sports the original was better and you mr richard <UNK> know that more than anybody br br this is an f movie
<START> first of all yes i'm white so i try to <UNK> lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway white people hating black people bad but black people hating white people ok because apparently we deserved it where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside <UNK> comedy scenes the infamous scene were ice cube and co get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking neo nazis and win the neo nazi where twice the size and the chase the chase is priceless this is not a movie about race tolerance and understanding it doesn't deliver this is a racist movie that re <UNK> all the cliché stereotypes the white <UNK> guy who gets <UNK> by his black roommate automatically <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> simply awful i do regret ever seeing it br br save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and rent american history x now thats a movie
<START> i have been eagerly <UNK> the opening of this film for several months being a huge jim carrey fan i easily saw how he could <UNK> himself into <UNK> grinch and make the character his own i was not disappointed br br this movie was pure magic carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did there was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come i already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video and i undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as i did the first time i saw it br br clearly this movie has jim carrey written all over it and i do not believe that it would have come together without him however the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right most notably the adorable taylor <UNK> who was the perfect foil for <UNK> antics the set design musical score and costumes all <UNK> their hands to a magical fabulous finished product and i believe all involved can be proud br br it is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film but howard has succeeded with flying colours for those critics who disagree perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 <UNK> too small
<START> although the plot was a bit sappy at times and very rushed at the end as if the director had run out of his <UNK> time and needed to hurry up and finish the story overall it was pretty good for the made for backwoods cable tv genre br br however the actress who played the babysitter <UNK> <UNK> was very good i hope to see more of her around in movie land the music was also well done getting every possible chill out of the <UNK> duh <UNK> duh think jaws type music based tension build ups br br i don't think i'd want to watch while the children sleep again but if i did it would be to focus on the performance of the talented <UNK>
<START> my comments on this movie have been deleted twice which i find pretty <UNK> since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people please be <UNK> of other people's opinion obviously writing in the spirit of <UNK> works is not understood so ill change my comment completely br br i think this is a really bad movie for several reasons br br subject one should be very careful in making a movie about a <UNK> that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions one thing <UNK> do agree on is that <UNK> was a great <UNK> so making a movie about his life which obviously includes his <UNK> is a thing one should be extremely careful with or preferably don't do at all wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know one might think this is not a review of the movie itself but the movie is not about an imaginary character it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had has great influence on the world of yesterday today and tomorrow if someone tells a story about a <UNK> i can express my thoughts about the story itself but also about the chosen subject the <UNK> there is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken br br screenplay one of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents why it <UNK> from what it should be about <UNK> and the truths he found it doesn't help putting things in a right <UNK> perspective or time come on make it proper english or better yet german even mel gibson got that part right letting his characters speak some <UNK> <UNK> in the passion br br secondly it is well over acted br br 3d <UNK> is not an actor to depict <UNK> bad casting br br 4th facts are way off br br and so on its a waste of celluloid
<START> what's wrong with this film many many things the editing tries too hard to look good and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also <UNK> him her with a powerful headache the plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short story or film the plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film we all know what happens to things when we stretch them right exactly they get thinner in the end the plot is just so paper thin that you might even miss it if you aren't paying attention which is hard to do when watching this movie the acting is not even slightly impressive the characters are poorly written and dull uninteresting one of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently whoever was in charge of the score soundtrack had no idea what the movie was or what it was supposed to be about not that i blame him i couldn't figure it out either as a result half of the music in the film doesn't fit the scenes at all also what was with all the sexual undertones between <UNK> <UNK> and the main character naturally this was in order to attract young males but it was just so cheaply done and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film on any <UNK> level at all the two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the film at all they were just there in order to have some chase scenes i doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful hollywood like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea but i <UNK> i recommend this to teenagers with low attention <UNK> who don't mind a really bad horror thriller as long as there's some sex and gore in it although that may only be true for the killer cut which i saw 1 10
<START> a brother's promise is a wonderful family film this is a biography of dan <UNK> a champion olympic speed <UNK> the movie depicts this <UNK> life from a young age through full <UNK> the love and support of the family members is evident throughout how dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us the commitment and determination of <UNK> coach and his <UNK> shows what it takes to make a real team how dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without <UNK> sentiment or <UNK> the faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives this is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age
<START> some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most br br i thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn't it br br i would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david <UNK> is only in this <UNK> so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last house br br other than that worth a look
<START> this movie is not a kung fu movie this is a comedy about kung fu and if before making this film sammo hung hadn't spent some time watching films by the great french comic filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> i ie e g <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> he is certainly on the same wave length br br personally i think <UNK> films are hilarious but they're not to all tastes some have told me that they <UNK> his work i've never figured out why but i think it's because the character that <UNK> usually plays himself is so totally dead pan so <UNK> by the events around him which he is usually causing that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around him br br at any rate <UNK> main <UNK> or at least his best known is to take a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with 19th century sensibilities and drop him into 20th century france where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the <UNK> <UNK> of those sensibilities he usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or <UNK> he's a <UNK> in a car but the world's no <UNK> when he rides a <UNK> but through it all he never loses his <UNK> which is derived from his inner recognition that the <UNK> century was more interesting than the 20th overall br br in a similar fashion the character sammo hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of hong kong utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that bruce lee made kung fu movies there this gets him into trouble in small ways since he takes in <UNK> <UNK> which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city such as the moment when he appears to be <UNK> in the street a cop stops him only to discover that hung is actually just <UNK> water out of his shirt <UNK> during an accidental <UNK> in the bay what's interesting about this gag is why it is hung doesn't understand what the <UNK> fuss is all about in a country town as long as no one's looking if you gotta go you gotta go in other words hung is not really <UNK> in the street but he certainly would and what's the problem officer of course <UNK> obsession with bruce lee also gets him into big troubles as well he beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurant owner uncle of course in a bruce lee movie the thugs would be considered <UNK> and they would have learned their lesson but in <UNK> hong kong reality unfortunately <UNK> and the thugs return when he's not around to <UNK> his uncle br br of course hung finally <UNK> in the end just as <UNK> always did characters like this must always triumph at least in comedy because they are completely innocent and as such despite their comic <UNK> and <UNK> they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be we don't really want to be bruce lee who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the bad guy we in our own innocence really want a world where lee's <UNK> are possible br br unfortunately that world only exists on film br br ah but what if and in that question we find sammo hung at his comic best
<START> titanic has to be one of my all time favorite movies it has its problems what movies don't but still it's enjoyable br br when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you don't i know so many people who don't like this movie and i'm not saying i don't see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist but this is a movie doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while the next complaint <UNK> and <UNK> are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full <UNK> however i think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected br br and finally if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then i'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things it's like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good movie br br well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best i've ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy br br i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epic br br i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it <UNK> down to them <UNK> the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed br br i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including <UNK> form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the <UNK> should be <UNK> <UNK> not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it br br i give this movie 10 10 not because i like romance movies but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events
<START> what made the french connection work so well was the relationship between doyle hackman and russo <UNK> in this catastrophe directed by <UNK> who also brought us such gems as <UNK> games and the island of dr <UNK> the movie focuses on doyle and his <UNK> obsession of capturing <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> idea that the <UNK> would allow doyle to travel to <UNK> to find <UNK> with the help of the french local authorities is laugh out loud funny correct me if i'm wrong but didn't <UNK> skip town with <UNK> pounds of pure <UNK> a street value of <UNK> million but yeah let's send doyle to find this guy it was his <UNK> after all please the story was weak the acting was terrible with the lone exception of hackman who completely <UNK> his part the direction was all over the place even the cuts between scenes were terrible do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one
<START> i admit i had no idea what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece it could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all i knew it began with great visuals little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild as it continued i learned quickly through voice overs what was taking place a nice little neo noir story that i felt was not a <UNK> of a few minutes of my time the little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning give them a sense of accomplishment as they piece together the plot along with a nice twist at the end its a cool package overall the score though not bad gave the film almost a music video feel it just felt a little dated not adding anything to further the storyline some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece i walk away from this very satisfied i was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice over work it didn't feel rushed or pushed great job
<START> this film turned up on local tv here in south africa recently and i thought that i'd warn even those who enjoy watching b grade bad movies which i do that this is not even amusing the plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country some strangers appear and the problem is that most of the film obviously shot in the early seventies consists of extreme wide shots of people walking in real time and awfully slowly from a to b this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens i am really curious how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end
<START> elephants dream was supposed to be the <UNK> project of the open source community and while it was a very interesting idea in concept in reality it has failed miserably br br the film is beautifully rendered which is probably the only redeeming factor a huge problem with them however is the vast <UNK> of light bloom it's horrible although i guess it helps give the film a <UNK> quality br br one thing to note is the terrible voice acting while <UNK> voice actor is at least semi competent <UNK> voice actor is horrible i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero you can't afford to hire real voice actors to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice br br as a whole the movie doesn't really go anywhere to me it seems like it's more of a look what we can do kind of movie instead of a real film the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas br br overall it may be worth a quick <UNK> from the official site but don't expect anything except pretty graphics
<START> warning spoilers ahead the writers of this story knew these men very well the actors likewise portrayed them very well the result is that by the end of the film you feel like you're actually watching john lennon and paul <UNK> the expected tensions are there especially in the awkward first moments but as the two begin to <UNK> up the old <UNK> that made the beatles work so well begins to show through the <UNK> is still there and <UNK> at times but by the time john gets the idea to take <UNK> michaels up on his offer to pay the beatles the gag sum of 3000 to appear on saturday night live the two could be the same <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> together as teens and survived playing the rough <UNK> of <UNK> to rise to <UNK> but in the end this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently we are reminded why a beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before <UNK> assassination the two driving forces of the group <UNK> each other
<START> sophia loren plays <UNK> in one of the worst films of all time she can't <UNK> in terms of production values the film is so bad that at one point while loren is <UNK> o <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> onto what looks to be a stone wall for support and the <UNK> set <UNK> and shakes
<START> the film began with <UNK> <UNK> into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt <UNK> may oliver a person too talented for this film didn't like <UNK> a sentiment i can easily relate to the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from <UNK> they left and <UNK> invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king at about the same time <UNK> was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king so when <UNK> arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friends which greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is a national <UNK> br br i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood the silent era through the 1940s i have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of <UNK> and <UNK> the only comedy team that might be as bad as the <UNK> brothers despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert <UNK> i can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better for example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother's film duck soup yet <UNK> nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp at times <UNK> talked a bit like <UNK> but his jokes never have <UNK> that even remotely are funny in fact he just seemed to <UNK> <UNK> his only funny quality was that he looked goofy surely not enough reason to put him on film additionally <UNK> had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese a piece of cheese that sang very poorly a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> as who's on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they started their <UNK> they just ended the routine so <UNK> that you are left frustrated i knew that who's on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but i really wanted to see <UNK> and <UNK> give it a fair shot and give it their own twist br br once again i have found yet another sub par film by this duo while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly such as silly <UNK> and the <UNK> which i actually gave <UNK> to on imdb this one was a major <UNK> test to complete something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of <UNK> and <UNK> where was all the humor
<START> look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie connery fishburne <UNK> harris <UNK> beatty <UNK> even cameos by <UNK> lange and <UNK> they prove in <UNK> the <UNK> that a good cast cannot save a bad script the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its <UNK> should have <UNK> even hollywood standards it's not particularly original and the twists are downright cruel
<START> i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television but the version put to dvd was a disaster the lighting was poor to non existent and entire scenes were simply <UNK> in one instance adele is being put to bed and we immediately cut to another scene coming in in mid sentence where it's the next night characters such as grace <UNK> and mason are never even introduced leaving one to wonder if they'd <UNK> off for a few minutes during the movie br br the dvd we saw was produced by <UNK> disc <UNK> and even at 6 <UNK> it was a <UNK> br br be careful which version of this movie you buy we're sending this one back
<START> please save your money and go see something else this movie was such piece of crap i didnt want to go but i had to so i thought i'd laugh at least once nope not a single laugh it was that horrible chris <UNK> will never get a good comedy role after this and a night at the <UNK> this movie is completely obvious has no smart humor at all and just repeats itself over and over again listen to me and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can
<START> seriously i don't even know where to begin it's like somebody gave a <UNK> dollar budget to an <UNK> third <UNK> and said <UNK> me a movie about the secret <UNK> the editing is ridiculous the cinematography was random at best every single <UNK> of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing well was there even a director there everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless and random and lame br br here's a spoiler for you this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see br br however if you liked this piece you'll also enjoy <UNK> dark blue and a partial frontal <UNK>
<START> having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer i had to see this movie with william h macy luis <UNK> michael <UNK> and sam <UNK> present it had to be good and it delivered overall the movie is not crack you up funny but there is one scene that really stands out and is in a my eyes a classic spoiler at the end where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see <UNK> and washington stare at <UNK> is just fantastic this is just as good as the scene in the big <UNK> where the dude is using a chair to <UNK> his door but forgets the door turns <UNK> end spoiler just go see this movie you won't be disappointed
<START> american nightmare is officially tied in my opinion with it's pat for the worst movie of all time br br seven friends oddly resembling the k mart version of the cast of friends gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare a pirate radio show it's <UNK> by a guy with a beard that's the most exciting aspect of his show br br chandler monica joey and oh wait i mean wayne jessie and the rest of the bad one liner <UNK> gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the <UNK> dj <UNK> to them a crazed nurse serial killer is listening br br crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and wait sorry again by making their fears come to life these fears include such <UNK> as voodoo and being gone down on by old ladies with <UNK> br br no really br br this movie was in a word rotten crazy <UNK> killing spree lacks motivation there's nothing to make the viewer jump the ending blows and again voodoo br br if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones rent american nightmare with them br br if you care for your loved ones even a little bit go to your local blockbuster rent all of the copies of american nightmare and hide them in your <UNK>
<START> this was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget <UNK> the use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably they made good use of the small budget i guess i just wish the story and most of the acting was better there are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don't confusing and unbelievable story bad dvd transfer too it doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting this i had to shut off it was too boring i can do slow movies but just make them appealing in some aspect visually story wise acting etc this was lacking in all <UNK> so it never added up to an engrossing experience maybe the film <UNK> next attempt will be better
<START> this one and her <UNK> soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone as i mentioned in my comment on the new series there's something lacking in this new series maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned it's a little bit more <UNK> and sentimental than <UNK> version however this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too i think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never <UNK> i remember i wasn't surprised by the korean movie <UNK> <UNK> later remade into the lake house i think it's because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film
<START> whatever the merits of the film it is poorly <UNK> as others have pointed out the movie shows locals in iran speaking in <UNK> rather than <UNK> that is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country the landscape could not be more different from the actual br br other factual errors a train is shown to be operating in afghanistan while afghanistan does not have <UNK> the turkish <UNK> is wearing a <UNK> the red hat whereas the <UNK> was banned by turkey much before the time in which the movie is set the turkish <UNK> daughter is actually dressed as an indian and indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes i suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman and <UNK> was what they decided would make her exotic
<START> the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good but still not work if the audience doesn't believe that the actor is portraying the person that's the main issue with young mr lincoln henry fonda gives a terrific performance but i found it hard to believe that abraham lincoln was as soft spoken as fonda portrays him br br this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young abraham <UNK> at the <UNK> whether or not this was a true story i don't know but if it isn't then why tell it using lincoln as the central character never mind though in the film lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder br br there's really not much to the film and as a result it seems rather empty i wanted more story and character development the film is 100 minutes long but it doesn't feel like it there are some little scenes featuring lincoln and the <UNK> relationship with mary todd but they seem superficial br br the acting is good all around but as i said <UNK> performance works as a character but not abraham lincoln i just don't believe that the real lincoln was that soft spoken true he has a big voice when he needs to such as when he <UNK> a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial but fonda portrays lincoln too <UNK> the other performances are solid though especially alice brady as <UNK> clay the mother of the accused she's a nice lady who we can really feel for simple and <UNK> yet very sweet we can see why lincoln wanted to help her br br john ford seems to think of this film as an epic and at the time of its release it probably was but even then there's just not enough material to present it as such br br it's a nice watch but not a classic
<START> the <UNK> which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the american <UNK> not <UNK> the united states itself it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans dont know about themselves 11 directors showing 11 amazing minutes each of something which will give us viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie
<START> steven what have you done you have hit an all new low it is weird since <UNK> last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash shadow man was good this was <UNK> bad so bad it wasn't even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway as for the action well let's just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn't make scenes sometimes flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time
<START> warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in <UNK> where the real events of the film took place other than that <UNK> <UNK> filmed in canada presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical <UNK> propaganda it is and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger <UNK> was <UNK> to make the <UNK> the heroes of the film when in fact the real <UNK> where a small private <UNK> based in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> air
<START> i am a kung fu fan but not a woo fan i have no interest in gangster movies filled with over the top gun play now martial arts that's beautiful and john woo surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie which almost has too much fighting if such a thing is possible this is good stuff br br many of the fight scenes are very good and some of them are less good and the main characters are amusing and likable the bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil but entertaining none the less you gotta see the sleeping wizard he can only fight when he's asleep it's hysterical br br upon repeated viewings however last <UNK> for <UNK> can tend to get a little boring and long <UNK> also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good hence i rate it only a 7 out of 10 but it really is almost an 8 br br all in all one of the better kung fu movies made <UNK> <UNK> in the heart of kung fu <UNK> prime all the really good kung fu movies are from the mid to late <UNK> with some notable exceptions from the late <UNK> and early <UNK> and early <UNK> to be fair
<START> this animated feature a co production between ireland <UNK> and france deals with what is surely one of the <UNK> subject ever for a movie the creation in the <UNK> century of a famous <UNK> <UNK> the book of kells in this fantastic retelling of that story a <UNK> boy named brendan living in a monastery ruled by his uncle a stern <UNK> who is worried preparing the <UNK> of the <UNK> from the impending attack by the feared <UNK> must get into the <UNK> surrounding forest to find the <UNK> that a master <UNK> named <UNK> needs to finish the book to do that task in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> drawn by hand there is some computer animation in a few key <UNK> in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional <UNK> art and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of <UNK> <UNK> this film is relentlessly strange but is a good strange not of the off putting variety but of the eye opening sort if one were to <UNK> beyond some <UNK> like an african monk in <UNK> century ireland  one would have to say that the blend of catholic <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> in this movie never really <UNK> and the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad that's why i cannot give them the highest <UNK> but these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film
<START> yes people are racist people are even racist in college that's a good point and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham <UNK> and predictable way possible oh yeah it's in college too br br this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems it <UNK> you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and <UNK> manner most of the characters are cartoonish one dimensional caricatures lesbian feminist angry black man that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible instead of <UNK> stereotypes this film is <UNK> with them the angry black men feel cheated <UNK> hate men etc one feminist even holds a sign that reads dead men don't rape see what i mean i don't want to give anything away but in this movie if someone seems like a <UNK> loner or a date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie the big twist in the plot <UNK> on whether or not the violent neo nazis will act like violent neo nazis i'll guess you'll just have to watch to find out what happens br br another problem i have with this movie is that it's supposed to be gritty and hard hitting but they make nazis the bad guys i agree nazis are evil but that's my point everybody thinks nazis are bad we're not breaking any new ground here nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930's the film doesn't challenge any <UNK> or make bold statements it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy after school special like manner being anti rape anti racist and anti nazi isn't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue br br higher learning is predictable cartoonish and in a word stupid avoid at all costs
<START> holes the novel was forced on me in an education course i didn't think i would like a children's novel plus the other couple of books i was forced to read for the class were really bad but to my surprise i absolutely loved holes it really is one of the most perfectly written novels i've ever read i think it has the rare quality that makes it appeal to pre teens teenagers and adults everyone who reads it i think will walk away a better person while i can't quite say that for the film i am happy to say that they got it mostly right i don't think viewers of the film will walk away as <UNK> but they will certainly be entertained without the side effect of being <UNK> when they sat down it is an intelligent story and it's very well told i think it moves a tad too quickly the novel takes more time in developing the characters and the flashbacks come in and out so quickly that they don't have too much time to register the <UNK> romance in the past feels more cliché and trite than it does in the novel and the ending which ties together all the loose threads seems very ridiculous it's exactly the same in the novel but there's a sense of the absurd that doesn't quite exist in the film it works a lot better i also don't like the <UNK> of pop songs i wish disney didn't feel it such a necessity to sell <UNK> the cast is across the board excellent from the young kids to the old pros jon voight is especially great not quite sure why we need <UNK> and the <UNK> though 9 10
<START> surely one of the most ill advised remakes of a classic in film history â especially since the promise of its tag line <UNK> most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all <UNK> <UNK> even properly exploited although this film was regularly shown on tv in my neck of the woods since my childhood days its <UNK> for awfulness not erotic content mind you kept me away from it until now â and i only <UNK> because i have recently enjoyed bo <UNK> previous film 10 1979 and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the christmas period br br lead actress producer bo derek is rather ridiculous playing the <UNK> ish sexual innocent witness the inept banana scene and as was to be expected she is made to get her clothes off a few times but as welcome as these scenes were she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here richard harris then <UNK> the scenery <UNK> as <UNK> obsessed <UNK> father but john philip law barely <UNK> as his <UNK> who <UNK> shows some initial interest in jane herself newcomer miles <UNK> has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie is completely silent throughout except for his famous <UNK> which is probably lifted from johnny <UNK> anyway and furthermore is as <UNK> as one of the trees he <UNK> from at regular <UNK> throughout the <UNK> second half for the record he later starred in two <UNK> movies or would be conan <UNK> for joe <UNK> and the king arthur era set sword of the <UNK> 1984 br br when still an actor director john derek who also serves as his own cinematographer here had worked with some good film makers cecil b de <UNK> william <UNK> and robert <UNK> and a few great ones otto preminger nicholas ray and don <UNK> but he clearly learned <UNK> from them as his direction of this one is a major <UNK> <UNK> pretentious at times witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence with a senseless <UNK> of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions this was <UNK> seventh film as a director and his second of four with wife bo and eventually he would only get to make two more br br the <UNK> utter failure only needs to be <UNK> by the fact that the tarzan legend was <UNK> once more on film â in <UNK> the legend of tarzan lord of the apes which surprisingly enough i <UNK> watched myself yet â a mere three years later nominated for six <UNK> awards including john derek richard harris and miles <UNK> and winning one for bo derek herself tarzan the ape man was co written by gary <UNK> the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing <UNK> to the silver screen of a this time animated heroic figure master of the universe 1987 which i will be <UNK> <UNK> as well <UNK> despite a charming closing credit sequence showing tarzan and jane playing with around with an <UNK> <UNK> and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion any <UNK> good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting bo completely white and <UNK> john <UNK> clear <UNK> in the character of tarzan himself which makes him come off as an <UNK> supporting character in his own self titled movie
<START> well what can you say about sitcoms there often quite lame <UNK> <UNK> and just plain so is this show it got a boring cast although a <UNK> is <UNK> in her <UNK> way the rest is just stereotypical crap as always we have all seen it before and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled cause lets face it its a mediocre and self righteous show as the most sitcoms are br br well in short if you wanna see some good entertainment you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror do some faces and move on its more entertaining than this show
<START> i really liked this film all three stars connery fishburne and <UNK> give credible performances and harris is <UNK> over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of <UNK> scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it 7 of 10
<START> richard <UNK> is not the star here he has about three 20 second cameos and what is gene barry doing all over this movie no idea the director was probably his brother this is a movie that makes no sense whatsoever the inept writer director same dude butchered up everyone's talent with his horrendous uh work i got the dvd for a penny so can't complain but it's weird and it makes you feel <UNK> out and in not a good way this was the 70's and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be inside his head it has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept but like a <UNK> record it quickly plays foul it has that <UNK> family on acid vibe to it br br i have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie maybe they worked in it back when at any rate be prepared to lose 80 min of your life you'll never get back yes it's that awful
<START> the good earth is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore there are a lot of big disasters and events but it is also a non passionate love story all of this happens in a little over two hours which is short by today's standards the special effects and costumes are very good for the time period br br i am surprised that <UNK> rainer received an oscar for such a <UNK> role she basically only has three emotions <UNK> hungry and heart broken br br the performances by the asian and asian american actors are terrific br br
<START> america needs the best man possible to win the game so who do they hire a <UNK> oh brother played by kurt thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas a village of <UNK> and richard norton who is told by kurt thomas to keep his <UNK> in his pants his exact words i missed this in theaters and it's a good reason because i would have probably been kicked out due to the laughing i broke into at regular <UNK> the first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a <UNK> can kick their ass kurt thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as the best man for the job as to the acting talent of kurt thomas well if you can't say something nice in all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to <UNK> an idea so stupid only the decision to cast tara reid as a scientist tops the <UNK> here for 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie i had ever seen not to say i didn't find this unwatchable i was laughing so hard i almost <UNK> to death twice only in the 80's could a movie with such a bad idea get made although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so <UNK> he can't even pull a <UNK> sword out from the ground this is the <UNK> action movie ever made and one of the most hilarious also br br out of 4 bad
<START> this is one of the <UNK> movies i have recently watched that's because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film <UNK> experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and <UNK> their experiences into a <UNK> that offers glimpses of their generally harsh <UNK> not every episode is depressing and harsh but overall this is definitely the tone let's see we have a case of incest rape attempted murder wife <UNK> alcoholism infidelity death of a little boy after eating <UNK> fish a man with severe depression he never talks during the movie and looks very scary a hopeless <UNK> who would probably be <UNK> with <UNK> a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments driving his street car through paths among the garbage <UNK> a man married to a total <UNK> i think i liked her character even less than the incestuous rapist etc etc in fact it is depressing enough that it seemed almost like an <UNK> bergman movie set in japan as bergman made many movies that tended to deal with mental illness and the <UNK> of life is it any wonder that after making this film <UNK> tried to kill himself so did i like it no it was not a fun experience but it was a very well made movie that definitely kept my attention and as a result i really wanted to see what happened to these people it was sort of like watching a train wreck you don't want to see all the carnage but you can't help but watch of all the vignettes i think that the older man who tended to look out for everyone and who didn't really seem to fit in he was too well <UNK> and wise to be living in a garbage dump was perhaps meant to represent <UNK> himself maybe i <UNK> br br if you've seen a variety of <UNK> films and have a high tolerance for strange art films give this one a watch however do not make this your first experience watching his movies it's sure to scare away many viewers
<START> this movie is to halloween what the hilarious christmas story is to christmas both are relatively low budget no big name stars type films and both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available both <UNK> classics <UNK> <UNK> comes <UNK> out right from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of characters all five goofy martians <UNK> the <UNK> russell the deputy <UNK> at the fuel <UNK> <UNK> and so many more you just have to see this movie to believe it and like christmas story it just keeps getting better and better with each viewing and you pick up on fun little things each time most definitely a ten
<START> i thought the movie was ok but very disappointed that they didn't capture the true image of his life i was so <UNK> to see his mother being an actual <UNK> that it's driving me crazy just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate which i completely lost interest just a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie i'm very disappointed that's like watching a biography story on mark anthony and having arnold play the part i don't know what the writer was thinking missing a valuable piece of the movie which i'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life i will say the movie was ok besides the major <UNK>
<START> if in the first 10 minutes of this film you don't realize that the main character who writes a life advice <UNK> is going to have the tables oh so cleverly turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself then there is probably something wrong with you the set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie even if the rest of the movie was good which it isn't br br there's almost no chemistry between the leads and steve <UNK> stalker ish behavior is embarrassing not funny it's hard to believe <UNK> character would have any interest in him then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after isn't that great america
<START> i still can't believe how bad this movie was if i wasn't a <UNK> i don't know if i would have survived the viewing it looks like it cost about 1000 to make but it wasn't the money that brought them down the acting was horrid not just bad 3rd <UNK> could have read the lines better second the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin and that is sorely lacking in this flick we don't even get to see the more attractive <UNK> in the buff br br <UNK> well better luck next time eh
<START> it's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes and none more so that september 11 2001 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism br br no this documentary didn't set out to be <UNK> on the events leading to 9 11 rather the filmmakers brothers <UNK> and jules <UNK> set out to do a documentary on the trials and <UNK> of a rookie new york <UNK> they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to join them in an ny <UNK> home to ladder 1 and engine 7 but their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane <UNK> into the world trace center br br i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of <UNK> <UNK> and received a call at about <UNK> local time from my dad who informed me of the above few minutes later he told me there was another and that the <UNK> was under attack by the time i arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were <UNK> and in smoke and to my horror they <UNK> under an hour br br the filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately <UNK> to the <UNK> upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the <UNK> of <UNK> where the first <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action the other camera held by the other brother was making his way to <UNK> to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of new <UNK> as well as the sense of chaos in and around <UNK> br br <UNK> throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7 which miraculously did not suffer any <UNK> but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event through the events that unfold we learn of the strong <UNK> amongst these men who risk live and <UNK> each day on their jobs to save lives br br we began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally <UNK> in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the <UNK> were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the <UNK> steel <UNK> it's not a film that is <UNK> and what you see here cannot be <UNK> in any other documentary and heavens not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters it's as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safety br br code 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7
<START> what a disappointment i hated the mummy but this one was even worse it was very <UNK> and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself <UNK> and <UNK> all the time i can't believe that people actually liked this movie the role of nicholas cage wasn't very convincing the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america's most wanted buildings the never stopping flow of hints and <UNK> wasn't very convincing either i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment what a drag i guess i've just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure
<START> spoilers contained in order to make a observation br br twenty years on from 1984 this film speaks loads about <UNK> future in the music industry br br there is a scene that sums up <UNK> musical <UNK> of the last 10 years perfectly which is if you took the best two songs off his last 10 albums you would have one fantastic album br br the scene plays like this prince runs off to his dressing room after playing one song and the owner of the club enters the dressing room to give prince an <UNK> about his fall from grace during the 90's and putting out albums that only the most hardcore fans would be able to tolerate and support his artistry br br club owner you're not <UNK> them like you used to the only person that <UNK> your music is yourself br br spooky huh how about the musical <UNK> which makes prince even more evil when he <UNK> <UNK> to the ground in two separate scenes it gave me chills that that was not the only scene women where <UNK> in this film br br i'm all for the comedy <UNK> between morris day and <UNK> <UNK> as these two stole every scene they were in but what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can that was plain nasty the other nasty bit was the <UNK> outline of <UNK> father on the floor <UNK> provided by the <UNK> police which causes prince to go even more loony fantastic br br purple rain is an entertaining film overall as it is the soundtrack of prince songs that <UNK> it's value by <UNK> but then again the film gives us another theory on prince and his music as the film tells us that <UNK> biggest song of the film is written by wendy lisa and <UNK> wife beating musical father br br are prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs maybe that is why prince started to run out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his fathers ideas <UNK>
<START> this movie was directed by victor <UNK> who also wrote the screenplay <UNK> gold nice and straightforward writing that was nominated for the independent spirit award looking at <UNK> day to day life what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby ashley judd sisters won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity she explores jobs friendships boy friends sex a typical young adult search the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival as an independent film <UNK> i picked the movie because of sundance i appreciate this type of movie because it does not carry the hollywood <UNK> br br although the stories are completely different this reminded me of <UNK> fool staring paul newman the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man i like that the story is very nicely told and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story the only thing i am not sure about is the title i am sure that there are not that many bugs and flies in paradise as there are in florida as i am <UNK> to <UNK> florida is no paradise to me i <UNK> all over thinking about florida i turn into a complete red <UNK> i recommend this movie favorite scenes ruby and her friend <UNK> bridges played by allison dean walking at the beach of <UNK> city florida indeed the sand is very white i have been there favorite quotes necessity has always been a good excuse all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now who is going to be and when and why br br
<START> the original 1965 japanese film gamera http pro imdb com title <UNK> was essentially an <UNK> of the darker less kid oriented <UNK> godzilla for 1960s sensibilities gamera of course is a giant flying flame throwing turtle who literally <UNK> energy not quite as big as some versions of godzilla but generally similar in most ways br br this version of the original film was edited and <UNK> by the notorious sandy frank and just like the <UNK> version of godzilla godzilla king of the monsters <UNK> the <UNK> gets more than just the spelling wrong the american scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great <UNK> but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them br br the film starts off promising there are a few scenes worth of character development and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot once gamera appears however the film begins to <UNK> into a fairly run of the mill <UNK> film br br the acting is good enough even the american add <UNK> are ok the directing is pretty good for this period and genre and the special effects are not bad at all for their time all <UNK> some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good br br the biggest problem here of course is that there is little to nothing original about this film gamera however develops a much more unique personality in his later films most of which are worth watching if you are a <UNK> fan
<START> every once in a while i will rent an action adventure film just as a way to relax and <UNK> my mind with nothing important this is why i own a copy of charlie's angels 2000 not a quality film but it makes me laugh and allows me to <UNK> for a while one of these days i will probably buy copies of the princess bride and a few monty python movies for much the same reason br br in any case i rented this film because i wanted to be entertained without being challenged for the most part i got what i wanted the plot was something along the lines of a poorly written <UNK> episode and the kathy <UNK> acting was very community theater not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress there were a few high points on the part of the <UNK> somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys unfortunately most of them die pretty <UNK> quick br br like most martial arts films the further you get into the movie the more emphasis there is on action and the plot which wasn't strong to begin with <UNK> almost as quickly as the acting however the more kathy long fights the more time the director <UNK> to her <UNK> by the end of the movie i was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times kathy <UNK> tight red shorts were center screen br br unfortunately there just wasn't enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time if you are a hard core <UNK> fan in need of something to <UNK> away a few hours by all means go to the <UNK> store and spend the 50 cents on the rental there are some strong similarities between the show and this movie br br just don't expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours br br unless of course you happen to like kathy <UNK> <UNK> then you might want to purchase a copy
<START> a lot of promise and nothing more an all star cast certainly by hk standards but man oh man is this one a stinker no story that's okay the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks what the action is terrible corny and sparse dragon <UNK> releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema this is a <UNK> they managed to <UNK> a couple of actors from <UNK> affairs but they can't bring life to a disjointed script there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying you almost feel like they're each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters michael <UNK> is made of wood really sammo hung uses a stunt double no way yes way stay away
<START> this is an entertaining movie actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or <UNK> its your everyday doctor how scary is that got some good actors and actresses in this movie though some where <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> as sarah ken <UNK> who you might recognize from rob <UNK> <UNK> rejects and halloween 2007 co stars as our detective on <UNK> dr alan <UNK> corbin benson trail short little summary is this dr alan feinstone a guy who has a sexy wife nice house and is a great dentist everyone loves until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool <UNK> then he starts having hallucinations that his <UNK> teeth are all <UNK> and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller but before that nice guy
<START> absolutely fantastic trash this one has it all nudity good fight scenes gore action explosions etc it also stars the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> as ingrid not <UNK> as the other reviewer pointed out although <UNK> turns into ingrid later on in the film you'll have to watch it to see what i mean br br i won't bother to go into the story as it's far too long <UNK> and not very interesting the relationship between ingrid and her brother bo robert <UNK> is interesting watch the <UNK> stealing scene to see what i mean br br the fight scenes were at once quite good and then <UNK> by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did city of the walking dead i e strange <UNK> blood <UNK> out of neck wounds br br i'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy its pretty rare though and i couldn't ever see anyone bothering to re release it so it'll become all the <UNK> in a few years br br anyway i'd recommend it solely for <UNK> <UNK> great nude scenes that <UNK> a fox
<START> although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death br br i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance br br the animation was ok i got the sense of the 80's anime from it which is what set it off for me why everyone else hates that is beyond me br br character development was fine i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around for you who don't like it obviously wasn't paying attention <UNK> tells you how it happens and she used his words br br <UNK> was a nice mentor soldier for her his dark <UNK> style was perfect for this kind of movie br br i think everyone here who has <UNK> this needs to take another look at it and <UNK> cause everything people have <UNK> this can be said about <UNK> favorite anime vampire hunter d
<START> this <UNK> has to be the biggest pile of steaming c p i have ever br br seen what more can i say than bad bad bad bad bad bad there is nothing to save this <UNK> and i pray that they never even talk about making a sequel if you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth movies like men in black has been torn to <UNK> and put back together to make this <UNK> but have totally failed please avoid this movie save yourself
<START> <UNK> 40 year old <UNK> me laugh a lot i don't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy i just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie steve carell is perfect as the virgin nerd andy <UNK> and i think the scene where andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest specially because it is real many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous by the way br br andy <UNK> has a peaceful life he is a little bit strange and <UNK> lots of toys but seems harmless one day while playing poker with his friends of his work they discover that andy is in fact virgin and he is already 40 years old after this surprising revelation all his friends are trying to make andy sleep with a woman the problem is the <UNK> in which andy gets in specially now that he is really starting to like <UNK> a woman he met when she was buying a dvd player in the store he works at
<START> this dreadful film <UNK> every asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package money <UNK> <UNK> japanese business men send goofy but <UNK> policeman pat <UNK> to recover industrial secrets in detroit here he encounters a down at <UNK> jay leno who promptly refers to a murder victim as a <UNK> and calls <UNK> <UNK> it's all downhill from there
<START> the last of the blond <UNK> is an entertaining bit of fluff judy <UNK> plays elizabeth a newly widowed woman at loose ends she has spent most of her life being the <UNK> wife and mother but has never been truly happy br br shortly after her husband's funeral elizabeth is having her regular lunch date with her stick in the mud children when she spots a street performer this sparks memories of when she was a member of an all girl swing band in london during world war ii we soon learn that the band was not exactly all girl as the drummer was a man dressing as a woman ala some like it hot br br elizabeth pulls out her <UNK> which she has been secretly practicing throughout her marriage and joins forces with the guitar playing street musician elizabeth is far more talented than the <UNK> and the money begins to flow in she doesn't take any money as she is wealthy and doesn't need it her playing is strictly for artistic <UNK> br br elizabeth is seen one day by patrick ian <UNK> who was the drummer in drag of the band it seems that patrick was and still is quite the <UNK> man and elizabeth being only fifteen at the time was the only band member who did not experience <UNK> talents other than <UNK> br br elizabeth is inspired by her <UNK> to get the old group together once again to play for the <UNK> school dance thus begins a delightful trip down memory lane combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie all topped off with some really good swing and blues br br i guess i'm at the age in which i really enjoy older actresses doing their stuff and this film is a treasure <UNK> as it not only stars <UNK> <UNK> but she is supported by none less than olympia dukakis leslie caron and a host of seasoned british character actresses this is all topped off by the extraordinary voice of <UNK> <UNK> br br yes it is fluff but totally delightful and exceedingly entertaining fluff
<START> don't say i didn't warn you but your gonna laugh probably enough to hurt your stomach sure it's got some blood <UNK> all in good fun though so it's got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this br br take the time and check this out well worth a two hour viewing if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live br br
<START> when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film and when i had i kinda had a feeling that felt like <UNK> it was a great movie don't get me wrong but i think the great parts where already in the trailers if you catch my drift it went very fast and it rolled on so i was never bored and i enjoyed watching it the humor was absolutely great my first contact with a <UNK> or something like it
<START> as in <UNK> recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male female relationship <UNK> centered on a female finding her one true love in this case desperation leads to a convict which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype clever and surprising story in many ways except that the female is there to support the male br br for those of us that don't speak french the subtitles are a little quick but not <UNK> br br the soundtrack as seems to be increasingly the case with european films is great and in perfect sync with the film's variations nothing seems forced visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies there's a wes craven in chicago feel to it
<START> to be fair i expected car chases in this film there was only really one but apart from that <UNK> was a great movie which i am glad to own on dvd the only really big names in the cast are <UNK> richard <UNK> as the radio psychiatrist and b movie villain par <UNK> billy <UNK> as the revelation <UNK> <UNK> killer but the rest of the cast generally give good performances i especially liked how <UNK> <UNK> gave her character sunny a bit of guts she could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out <UNK> with the help of bounty hunter james russo br br russo i'm afraid comes across as rather wooden but then again the character he plays frank isn't very well fleshed out save for a back story sunny is given by his former commanding officer the tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely la <UNK> at night with the killer <UNK> its' length in his sinister grey <UNK> is an excellent way of building tension and the music used to <UNK> the film is suitably composed i don't know why there are some people who hate this movie so different <UNK> for different folks i suppose but i absolutely enjoyed <UNK> and i can strongly recommend it
<START> he is the quintessential <UNK> and <UNK> in this case portraying attorney and murderer tom <UNK> br br kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim anne marie <UNK> but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his <UNK> of several other women including rachel ward as well br br the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self <UNK> issues and <UNK> actually had her psychologist killed pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true story br br there is a cameo with olympia dukakis excellent as <UNK> mother all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann <UNK> book to get the accurate details 8 10
<START> i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me to tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hot <UNK> but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death i was inside you i think that's what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that she's too young when he never cared how old the other girls were now i don't think i myself could ever trust a cop like that but to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way and that was funny when she <UNK> him in the eye in the store <UNK> she was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello it's called back up sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things but that's what i think an thought about the movie
<START> wonderfully put together i wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost there should be a part two a real one it was great the film wasn't long enough i would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up this is so important to the community period well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort i am really tired of hearing from naive writers how aids and men go together when they don't actually its the <UNK> that we need to look into this film didn't even bother to mention hiv or aids and i was so glad for that i really appreciated the break downs and <UNK> too thank you s much for allowing this film to exist
<START> portrays the day to day stark reality of survival on a ranch in the old west outstanding acting by both principal actors this doesn't even feel like a movie you feel like you're there animal <UNK> should beware many scenes are obviously not just realistic they are real
<START> besides planes trains and <UNK> and uncle buck this is john <UNK> funniest movie when he gets <UNK> with the playing card similar to the <UNK> candidate and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he is saying he makes two very memorable quotes both deal with the male <UNK> the love scene involving <UNK> items has to be seen it cannot be described br br
<START> this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the <UNK> <UNK> shortly before the <UNK> lost a big battle against the <UNK> who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan really i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background br br <UNK> <UNK> also known as the original zatoichi gives a superb performance as <UNK> <UNK> one of the four <UNK> human <UNK> of the <UNK> he is a simple samurai who <UNK> all of his wealth in order to have a good life he becomes a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out of sword of doom <UNK> is a ultra <UNK> politician who lets his band of <UNK> <UNK> a lot of high <UNK> pro west politicians in order to achieve his political goals <UNK> <UNK> follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore <UNK> killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes br br it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with <UNK> who is a samurai who rejects violence does he change his ideas and views on life but too late br br watch the movie to see the end of <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance each actor reaches up to their role the sword fights a very unique and fast probably faster than several movies nowadays br br check it out if you have the chance
<START> the night <UNK> is probably not one of <UNK> best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie but i think it's the great plus of the movie it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006 it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling this is no <UNK> movie neither is it a predictable movie you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be this is no excellent movie that has everything but hell it's a damn good and very original movie
<START> this is one seriously disturbed movie even though the boys deserved some of what they got the sadistic gruesome <UNK> were slightly over the top the only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot br br at the beginning of the movie there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair but this was just a <UNK> to <UNK> the viewers into a false sense of security before the joy of what was to come br br the only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if jack nicholson had jumped out of the <UNK> and <UNK> and where is the batman kim basinger could have screamed br br now that would have been cool
<START> well magic works in mysterious ways this movie about 4 prisoners trying to escape with the help of spells written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense even if it had something of a theater play almost everything happens in the cell it never got boring and it was acted very well in the tradition of cube you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal you developed some sympathy with some of them only to change your mind by the twists the story takes some happenings <UNK> you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air altogether intense and entertaining and as i didn't expect anything a friend rented it it was a positive surprise
<START> predictable hackneyed poorly written <UNK> i <UNK> such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days and will only get worse that one cannot pick and choose much any more early on we were given an <UNK> who was was <UNK> in the assassination and we had it <UNK> down our throats ever since the movie lacked intrigue giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder some of the <UNK> was frankly embarrassing it's hard to believe anyone would even consider let alone commit to the spending of <UNK> of millions of dollars to make this tripe
<START> a truly dreadful film i did not know initially that this was a <UNK> effort but very soon i started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised <UNK> accents under the fake american ones why did it need to be set n america anyway it could have been set in <UNK> and then the actors could have used their normal voices surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with american accents a bad bad film i am surprised it has lasted this long how did it make it out of the can it just seemed like a very poor attempt at a segal willis type action man flick a total waste of money if there was any <UNK> money in this piece of trash i would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the <UNK> i am still <UNK> get it pun <UNK> at the absolute garbage i have just seen why did i continue to watch well i am a movie fanatic and cant help myself
<START> i have to admit i have always found it difficult to watch an antonioni film from start to finish at the first try and even for this one i ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions in the end i realised perhaps it was better that way because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one br br the first part seems a lot more <UNK> which is not a bad thing it just requires more of an effort to follow when it gets to the desert scenes all efforts are <UNK> in full the stunning cinematography is only a part of it what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence the silence and <UNK> of it the sense of sadness and freedom the way it <UNK> and <UNK> with the two young characters the desert is dead but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part the dance between the airplane flying over and the girl's car makes for a series of great shots the love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times there is of course something very stylish and studied about them but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days it all feels loose and <UNK> thanks also to the understated acting but that is the result of a <UNK> attention to detail and form which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end a really <UNK> spectacle it just leaves you in awe br br i don't really care for some the usual <UNK> boring well yes it is if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists but then if all cinema was like that that would be truly dull and sad pretentious maybe but when that kind of <UNK> is coupled with actual skills depth and style pretentious is a compliment the political criticisms make the least sense to me i don't see the point of approaching a film like this with <UNK> <UNK> or worse patriotic <UNK> it just <UNK> the purpose perhaps it's true that like a previous <UNK> <UNK> antonioni viewed these young <UNK> and the politics of <UNK> and <UNK> with the police with the fascination of a <UNK> but i think that adds something rather than <UNK> from the film it's not true that hippies did not exist in italy at the time think of the <UNK> <UNK> like in france although they were obviously different from the american counterpart and in some ways even more <UNK> but his interest in this film was not <UNK> political the events seem more like a <UNK> for a film whose appeal has a universal timeless quality br br a special mention for the fantastic soundtrack amongst other things this film along with easy rider is probably one of the main earliest <UNK> of the contemporary <UNK> music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own but unlike the former it uses music in a much more subtle way <UNK> it with the landscape rather than the action br br if you want traditional narrative in a film then don't bother if you want to be stunned be patient and you won't regret it
<START> putting the <UNK> thing aside this was the best documentary i've seen factual <UNK> by neil and buzz a must see the interviews and <UNK> are a revelation since most of the information was <UNK> <UNK> in 1969 and only released in 2006 no documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief <UNK> minutes the facts will blow you away and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon neil and buzz are probably the biggest hero's of our time ever see a man save his own life bet not neil saves his life when only <UNK> seconds separated him from death amazing to watch it is a travesty people have not known all the details <UNK> with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death from a failing computer 10 stars
<START> i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore <UNK> and his four sons they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film warner <UNK> in his portrayal of adam <UNK> talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our <UNK> president without some of the more <UNK> aspects of <UNK> character br br like <UNK> all of the <UNK> sons serve in world war i in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed br br but what if a female <UNK> gets into this all male household and <UNK> things that's susan <UNK> job here in one of her earliest prominent roles <UNK> is a <UNK> amoral girl who marries one son has an affair with another and starts making a play for the third it's an early <UNK> of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to live br br i suppose that with as powerful a model of <UNK> as theodore <UNK> was and warner <UNK> portrays everyone is afraid to tell father what's going on the sons and also their <UNK> ingrid bergman here's where the plot gets a little silly bergman is introduced to us as a <UNK> hired by <UNK> and wife fay <UNK> for their kids <UNK> dies and <UNK> suffers some financial <UNK> in business bergman has to be let go she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up br br i'm sorry but i can't believe the kids need a <UNK> now <UNK> is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn't the kids who brought her back in the normal course of things bergman would have gotten on with her life br br one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have br br it's too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when <UNK> was at her heights and bergman had just made a comeback br br susan <UNK> is the main reason to see adam had four sons and i'm willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor
<START> scientist working <UNK> in <UNK> finds a way to locate the impact <UNK> of a meteor carrying a new <UNK> element all pseudo science and breakthrough technology talks of the 1930s are right there including the idea that <UNK> could <UNK> any illness if properly <UNK> when he <UNK> his rivals who had cast him out of the scientific community and <UNK> him to witness his discovery they <UNK> a <UNK> expedition to africa of course they end up stealing much of dr <UNK> original discovery giving him only <UNK> credit in addition to that an <UNK> <UNK> who looks like a supporting comedy actor from the worst <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> literally steals dr <UNK> young <UNK> wife drake who falls head over heels for that <UNK> of a human being having grown <UNK> like a deer wasn't going to make dr rukh karloff any <UNK> so he <UNK> in an undercover revenge mission killing 2 of his <UNK> and friendly dr <UNK> lugosi the only one who had helped him finally <UNK> to the deadly <UNK> that had allowed him to <UNK> in his revenge to start with but to my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and that poor excuse for a human being she had married acting is mostly fine with karloff lugosi being very good check the hysterical <UNK> scene other characters aren't worth mentioning recommended much like all old universal horrors
<START> if it's action and adventure you want in a movie then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere on the other hand if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood check out the straight story br br richard farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and <UNK> alvin straight in this true story of <UNK> journey on a riding <UNK> across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke br br farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels his long and <UNK> road making friends of strangers and <UNK> out lots of <UNK> type advice about family along the way the story moves along as slowly as the riding <UNK> but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching waiting for the next life lesson <UNK> going to offer br br stretch out on the couch relax and enjoy it's the only way to watch this very good movie which rates a 7 10 in my book
<START> i was expecting a movie similar to <UNK> <UNK> which i enjoyed however this dud seemed to last forever it's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg 13 while not being kid appropriate the jokes aren't just low brow or f t jokes they're crude <UNK> and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg 13 rating too bad it might have made a bigger <UNK> as an r rated film if the funny was left in <UNK> probably i do not recommend this movie it is a full on waste of time and i'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot at 45 minutes in the movie felt like it should be <UNK> down and boy were we ready for it to the ending is quaint but doesn't salvage the rest of this <UNK> tourist trap of a rental 1 2 star glad i saw it as a <UNK> would have been <UNK> to pay hard earned <UNK> for this tripe
<START> this is the biggest piece of crap ever it looks like they spent more time effort and money making the dvd cover than they did on the actual movie i really thought the dvd had been switched out with someone's <UNK> porno until i recognized one of the actors from the cover this movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats the picture is really clear but that along with the very unfortunate lighting cinematography if you can call it that production acting if that is actually what they are doing and script if they had one makes this movie look worse than an old porno at least the old porno has a point this just looks like some <UNK> members got together and decided to make a really disturbing pointless <UNK> about animals rights and feelings this is so not worth the money or the time it has nothing in common with the actual btk serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims the people who made this movie should be glad he's not still free or he might have come after them just for <UNK> up this movie so bad
<START> the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down to earth the romance between two teen age boys on the screen was done in good taste you can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> paul naschy travels to <UNK> and is bitten by a yeti which causes him to become a werewolf he is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover and is later <UNK> by a female scientist dr <UNK> <UNK> who uses him in mind control experiments <UNK> later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments br br upon hearing of <UNK> death from colleague jon <UNK> i <UNK> through my collection for a suitable film to watch in my <UNK> i found i own not one but three copies of fury of the <UNK> the film is of questionable video quality the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times and the american versions have two love scenes removed quite frankly without a <UNK> uncut copy i wasn't really getting the proper movie in all its glory br br this film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf count <UNK> <UNK> i suspect this is true but you wouldn't know this from the film itself the plot is confusing at times and there's really no indication that this is a sequel if you read the plot <UNK> on <UNK> and compare them to what is <UNK> on the box you'll see that i'm not alone in my confusion br br perhaps the film's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through while floating around for years it was only released in 1973 due to problems involved in finding a <UNK> and naschy said in his autobiography that the director <UNK> was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him those really aren't light <UNK> and i have no idea what <UNK> had to say on his own behalf br br chances are sooner or later you'll come across a low grade version of fury of the <UNK> it appears in a variety of three packs and box sets so you might accidentally <UNK> it and not even know what really needs to happen is an american uncut version with a decent sound and video mix and the love scenes thrown back in as far as i know this does not exist let us honor paul <UNK> legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves
<START> does anyone know what kind of pickup john t drove i looks like a mid to late 70's ford this movie is my favorite as well as my wife's it was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck i drove and recently found another like it i would like to <UNK> the pick up i have to resemble the on in the movie also the music was awesome and the acting was great where and what is the lady who portrayed john's aunt also did john have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell also what year of <UNK> did debra w drive in this show it looked like a 60's model thanks
<START> i should say right away that i checked the spoilers box only because i'm giving this comment the amount of thought <UNK> to what this mess of a movie deserves and don't want to be held responsible for some plot point incidentally <UNK> out br br this comment will take the form of a <UNK> for the simple reason that i am still under the influence of this movie having just watched it and the unique effect this has <UNK> one incapable of the sort of <UNK> and paragraph structure required for coherent <UNK> criticism that is not a compliment it isn't the <UNK> effect of a truly hypnotic or thought provoking movie the feelings it <UNK> up combine like some uncomfortable emotional <UNK> composed of a confusing mix of some form of rage the vague desire to take a shower the <UNK> sinking feeling of true betrayal one gets when they realize they have given <UNK> minutes of their lives into the hands of someone who would not only <UNK> it but do so in such a pompous <UNK> way and i probably wouldn't have done anything super <UNK> with that <UNK> minutes anyway but even if i'd spent it on something trivial like a power block of masturbation and online poker i would have felt more <UNK> when all was said and done br br the problems with this movie are <UNK> and in better times i'd <UNK> exactly what they were in a semi adult fashion but in keeping with what this movie deserves i think i'll most likely stick to the realm of masturbation jokes and cartoon references br br the most irritating and <UNK> flaw is that while watching this movie one is <UNK> aware that the makers and participants think they are making a much smarter movie than they are <UNK> the depth of knowledge one could pick up in a one <UNK> <UNK> of western art history at a community college or trade school the art <UNK> is <UNK> on thick and from all directions with much of it <UNK> by talk between our hero the tortured detective stan willem dafoe who i will forgive for this movie due to him being willem dafoe and his <UNK> <UNK> dealer buddy blair peter <UNK> taking a break from playing a <UNK> for whom murder comes easy by playing a 2 dimensional plot device in a movie about a <UNK> for whom murder comes easy and talk they do in fact we are dropped into this story at a crime scene that may indicate the <UNK> of a serial killer stan thinks he killed years earlier so all the back story is established partially through unclear flashback but primarily through stilted conversations between stan and his dealer or stan and his colleague the <UNK> irritating carl scott <UNK> and although i <UNK> the character carl scott <UNK> from the actor who plays him by using <UNK> i must admit that very early on in the film i <UNK> this character so much that i actually found myself sincerely wishing harm on the actor portraying him scott <UNK> not anything too fancy not death or <UNK> necessarily but maybe <UNK> or maybe a stage light could fall on him and crush his arm this is a dangerous <UNK> but i'm not editing it out because i want to leave anyone reading this who's thinking about paying to see this train wreck of a movie with a clear impression of the horrible wishes and feelings it <UNK> in even the most peaceful man br br well i'm sort of running out of steam here over the course of writing this the sick feelings this movie brought up in a me have <UNK> my head has <UNK> a bit realizing now that i'm still <UNK> time in something related to this piece of sh t is <UNK> similar to waking up after a night of <UNK> heavy drinking next to the <UNK> form of a still <UNK> 200 pound college girl your first urge is a desperate desire to flee this is natural
<START> wow i loved the whole series and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly perhaps it <UNK> a bit in seasons 4 5 while remaining better than anything else on television but 6 and particularly <UNK> were beautiful <UNK> on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons br br <UNK> started with such a <UNK> mood and <UNK> always keen insight into the family angst that doom filled line about knowing tony's <UNK> for sitting and staring anyone who missed the <UNK> of that for the rest of the series does not know tony <UNK> <UNK> over the psychiatric study and its references to the <UNK> self <UNK> sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series say with tony's panic attack over the <UNK> leaving his pool and <UNK> with <UNK> wave bye bye line to his <UNK> before the coup de grace of the final episode not to get into <UNK> dark humour br br i could go on and on but i'll just add that i thought the final show starting with the opening <UNK> of vanilla <UNK> to supply the ironic <UNK> you keep me <UNK> on to the <UNK> moments where tony fades back into <UNK> with his family in <UNK> or <UNK> apart like <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> head were utterly utterly perfect the best tv ever br br pretty good in a dying medium <UNK> <UNK> the jack off fantasies <UNK> <UNK> and then into which he promptly <UNK> a tip of the <UNK> pie to mr chase
<START> to say that thunderbirds is a horrid forced in your face ugly looking nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldn't be saying enough there are only two reasons i can think of why you'd watch this film 1 you've seen thunderbirds when you were young like i did and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up or 2 you're seeing it with someone under ten years old br br thunderbirds manages to <UNK> up everything it attempts the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle <UNK> things that are painfully obvious when you think about it from the off thunderbirds is wrong wrong wrong the whole moral message and <UNK> is set up in an excruciating way jeff tracy a new low for bill paxton tells his youngest son alan he's not yet proved himself to be a <UNK> after alan randomly and <UNK> decided to go down into tracy <UNK> <UNK> to fire up <UNK> one the whole film is then a series of events and miss fires <UNK> of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard <UNK> five br br the film relies on kid actors to carry the film a 16 year old alan tracy <UNK> a 16 year old tin tin <UNK> and a 14 year old <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> son to say that watching the <UNK> they get up to is painful is an understatement frequently trying to act and <UNK> the script whilst <UNK> the evil <UNK> kingsley in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film it only <UNK> when everyone's in a different location also the whole <UNK> <UNK> thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was <UNK> and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood  forced and incidental br br i know that most <UNK> for kids' these days try to <UNK> some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds it's done in a way that <UNK> lady penelope sophia <UNK> plays penelope and i think it's no coincidence she's a little older than the rest of the kids  at 24 years old it's almost too good to be true her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push we see her in the bath <UNK> up to her neck watching tv in comes her butler and <UNK> a <UNK> as she <UNK> changes channels with her wet bare and bubble covered foot frequent shots of her massive bright pink high <UNK> shoes filling the screen during various scenes this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman <UNK> with this her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh <UNK> english accent sounding like a commanding mistress well she is lady penelope after all  and you'd better make sure call her that the whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids won't notice but it sure as hell is there br br the actual plot of the hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre the characters that are his <UNK> a geeky looking woman and hard <UNK> black man who gets <UNK> a lot are we supposed to be laughing at this what about the fight scenes poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises it's utterly utterly laughable br br the list goes on the way bill paxton plays it all so seriously like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another the way ford <UNK> company have their <UNK> slapped all over the place news <UNK> <UNK> by ford the camera even moves to <UNK> ford several times when cars are in shot the way the cgi looks like something out of a computer game video clip  it's <UNK> the fact we are told to believe that a 16 year old girl can swim in the <UNK> <UNK> against the current rescue a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over the <UNK> get back to the <UNK> and thus save the day all the time holding her breath it is absolute bull and the makers know it  i don't even know if a 10 year old would swallow it br br in short avoid avoid avoid thunderbirds is <UNK> unfunny poorly scripted and even the rolls <UNK> was taken out and replaced by a flying car  everything that could go wrong did go wrong
<START> ah i loved this movie i think it had it all it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times yes i am a girl so i'm writing this from a girl's perspective i think it's a shame it only scored 5 2 in rating too many guys voting it was far above other romantic comedies just because i'm female i don't enjoy all <UNK> flicks on the contrary i prefer other genres romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be but like i said this movie had it all almost in my opinion great script good one liners fine acting although eva longoria <UNK> character reminded very much of <UNK> from desperate <UNK> but so what it was awesome i will keep this film for rainy days days when i feel low and need a few laughs
<START> personally i disdain the jerry springer show however i found <UNK> to be the funniest movie i've seen this year the never ending satire of jerry springer guests starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie despite a brief scene in which jerry springer makes a feeble attempt at <UNK> his existence i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value
<START> one of my favorite films for a number of years was last action hero unfortunately arnold <UNK> decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt <UNK> politician so now i can't bear any film he may had a hand in br br the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last hero so i was pleased to find it on dvd so i could watch these themes played out so well br br despite the plot within the plot involving white slavery during an african <UNK> civil war this is not an action movie the plot that the plot within a plot is within is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white slave <UNK> or is he actually a fictional character which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional adventure story universe that's actually a rich theme the potential <UNK> of which is <UNK> by the film's <UNK> and campy sense of humor br br there are weaknesses to the film primarily it's cinematography which makes the film look like a tv show and the pacing does <UNK> on occasion br br but i really like these characters and i enjoy the adventure they live however silly and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel br br holds up under multiple viewings m good show
<START> the acting other reviews notwithstanding was remarkably well done brad pitt handles the role of an annoying obnoxious <UNK> <UNK> quite well other acting is fine the story could have been riveting but somehow it misses one never really understands or cares for the characters shown and so the story which could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in this audience br br beautiful scenery and cinematography a remarkably dramatic true story important events that shaped the world that we live in but i could not try as i might involve myself in this story as an <UNK> brad pitt fan i consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation i expected to love this flick and yet it left me cold br br it could be a failing within myself but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie direction <UNK> production editing somehow they lost me it's a shame because it could have been wonderful br br good acting dramatic story beautifully shot it should have been magnificent it wasn't probably worth watching just to make your own mind up on it but don't expect too much and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as i was mostly it bored me
<START> of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already <UNK> <UNK> is one of my most favorite characters i just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24 7 servant on his motorcycle watch movies and <UNK> characters etc etc i love the scene when a stone cracks in <UNK> <UNK> mouth while eating also where <UNK> kapoor <UNK> a corny story of <UNK> <UNK> affairs on a dinner table and govinda wearing <UNK> <UNK> uniform makes sentimental remarks thats my favorite scene of the film <UNK> <UNK> to main <UNK> <UNK> scene is just chemistry between two great indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs its brilliant it's a cat mouse film just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other its total entertainment if you like govinda and <UNK> khan chemistry then its a must i think <UNK> is <UNK> in my list by david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> this gem of a film 7 10
<START> i can't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they won't like it my mom likes violent movies so why did she see it she rated it just to bring down the rating so i know that's why it didn't have a higher rating i give it a 6 10
<START> jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to <UNK> but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and <UNK> complex machines it is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book please don't ruin this great piece by your simple <UNK> the reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned please read the book as is it a great source of information i enjoyed it a lot this book is even a taught as a text book at some <UNK>
<START> sitting <UNK> nothing is the latest what if fest offered by <UNK> natali and starring david <UNK> and andrew miller as two losers one is having relationship problems got <UNK> from his job because of relationship problems and the police are out to get him because of his job and his relationship problems the other guy is a <UNK> who refuses to go outside his home is met by a <UNK> girl guide who calls on her mom to claim she was <UNK> when he doesn't buy <UNK> from him oh yeah the police are after him too after the mom of the girl <UNK> call them in to arrest him br br man what a day br br what if you could make all of this disappear that is the whole premise behind <UNK> the two fools realize the cops the girl <UNK> the cars the lawn the road <UNK> disappear there's nothing but white space this is an interesting concept i thought i also looked at the time of this 30 minutes had gone in the movie and i still had an hour left in the movie could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes although the actors try 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie but the two actors whom are life long friends with each other and the director have such great <UNK> with each other that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve <UNK> around the two do there are lots of supernatural elements but it's more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing
<START> what can possibly said about this movie other than viewer beware christmas evil should come with a warning label like <UNK> do because this was <UNK> to my eyes and ears i am rarely this <UNK> with a b horror flick but this movie couldn't even bring a little scare to a five year old the point of a relentless lunatic that has a <UNK> for blood in a film is that he she should seem almost god like like nothing can stop their <UNK> rage but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a <UNK> in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus it's a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he's far too stupid to be dangerous all in all a total waste of film
<START> in the early to mid 1970's <UNK> irving <UNK> to write the ultimate biography of howard hughes claiming to have spent months preparing for the book engaged in interviews with the <UNK> millionaire when all of this turned out to be false irving was accused of <UNK> spent several years behind bars although always <UNK> his <UNK> were accurate flash forward to <UNK> several months prior to september <UNK> a book entitled <UNK> <UNK> published in the u s as <UNK> lost love and death in modern day <UNK> by a previously unknown author by the name of norma <UNK> a woman from jordan who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend <UNK> due to the fact that <UNK> being from a <UNK> muslim background was dating a christian man it like <UNK> biography on hughes was revealed as a potential <UNK> australian film maker anna <UNK> attempts to delve into the <UNK> that was <UNK> attempts to clear herself of the lie s over the time frame of <UNK> minutes the film attempts to reveal is norma <UNK> telling the truth or is she just a <UNK> liar with an agenda <UNK> of her own interview footage with those who know knew her including an ex husband her <UNK> and others tell their side of the story this is a <UNK> well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties not rated but contains <UNK> bad language a re <UNK> of the grisly murder scene played over a few times but nothing nearly as graphic disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic such as saw part <UNK> not a good choice for the little ones
<START> <UNK> is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a <UNK> cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab <UNK> the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and <UNK> charm just doesn't save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film
<START> some comments here on imdb have <UNK> dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> isn't really sleazy lurid or <UNK> enough to earn that comparison however it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hard edged action is your thing br br edison <UNK> plays <UNK> a <UNK> hit man who travels to hong kong to <UNK> the wife of a judge sam lee is <UNK> the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost with <UNK> closing in on his target <UNK> will stop at nothing to ensure his <UNK> he meets <UNK> a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse br br a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design a haunting score and solid performances from <UNK> and lee as well as newcomer <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> love interest dog bite dog is one for fans of hard hitting asian hyper violence think along the lines of chan <UNK> <UNK> vengeance trilogy <UNK> shootings <UNK> <UNK> all happen regularly in this film and are caught <UNK> by director <UNK> br br of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies rather nasty deaths unfortunately there is a fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in its final moments dog bite dog crosses it in a laughably over dramatic final scene <UNK> and <UNK> are locked in battle as a pregnant <UNK> looks on eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the <UNK> a wounded <UNK> performs a <UNK> <UNK> on a now dead <UNK> delivering their baby moments before he himself dies br br whilst this film might not be a <UNK> slice of hong kong excess with its <UNK> <UNK> action and stylish visuals it's still worth seeking out
<START> this is a great movie for the true <UNK> and sports lovers alike br br drew barrymore is at her best in this movie as a drew fan it was quite nice to see her shine after having several <UNK> i had my doubts about jimmy fallon but he totally delivered as ben the comical sports crazed sweetheart the comedy in this movie is great there were several laugh out loud moments br br their first date started rocky when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day instead of leaving he helps take care of her helping her change into <UNK> then cleaning up the <UNK> on her toilet and bathroom later telling her that she was <UNK> lady like no <UNK> ' everything goes great between ben and lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts lindsay starts to realize just how obsessed ben is with the red sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single she tries to <UNK> it off and think of it as a good thing as she has a busy work schedule and she wont feel guilty for working extra hours while he is at games she even buys all the books on the red sox she can find including one on 'the curse of <UNK> br br everything is going pretty well until lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period it both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with a very touching part in the movie is after she tells him she got her period it shows him sadly putting away a baby sized red sox jersey he had bought just in case she was pregnant br br eventually ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday party after she said i had to check my <UNK> and when i saw the there was a red sox <UNK> game i knew i would be going <UNK> after the party ben tells her it was 'the best night of his <UNK> shortly after he gets a call from his pal who went to the game he gave up for the party and told him it was the best game ever ben freaks out about missing it and ends up really hurting lindsay when she says a few minutes ago you were saying this was the best night of your life he says well that was a few minutes ago br br so they separate for a while he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets which he inherited from his uncle because if he didn't it would <UNK> him too much of what he gave up for <UNK> lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her it ends very <UNK> showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over <UNK> for a whole new deeper love lindsay they still go to the games and even attend the final world series game and st louis and it is a happy ending all around 2 thumbs up
<START> a great storyline with a message joan <UNK> is superb as <UNK> mike <UNK> is hilarious as coach and richard de <UNK> plays the role of <UNK> superbly <UNK> barton as frankie puts in a good performance and ingrid as <UNK> plays her first lead extremely well this film is superbly directed by jo beth williams the editing is first rate
<START> what the <UNK> do we know is a <UNK> and <UNK> look at the mysteries of the universe we are presented with a parade of apparent experts none of whom are named who <UNK> and <UNK> in a thoroughly <UNK> manner their interviews are chopped up into <UNK> small segments and <UNK> throughout some flashy cgi and banal mini plots br br the film <UNK> themes from science philosophy <UNK> and politics <UNK> them together without any regard for accuracy and then somehow <UNK> a few <UNK> and absurd conclusions we are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence and any other difficult to answer question the film makers would like to point their finger at br br it is <UNK> errors and logical non <UNK> how did we start at quantum <UNK> and end up with this pseudo scientific <UNK> and <UNK> it's like saying <UNK> plus two equals four therefore i can move objects with my <UNK> br br there is nothing original in this film and almost nothing that is accurate any <UNK> viewer will be annoyed by heavy handed editing <UNK> and pointless special effects and general lack of substance educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on
<START> hollywood now has officially gone too far and i really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine <UNK> against their crap machines in spite of the good box office returns if you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next stop stop making our tv shows into these <UNK> stupid money <UNK> waste of time movies that suck by doing so you are proving one thing hollywood is out of ideas and going to see the movies they <UNK> out only <UNK> the cycle of disgust what's next you guys gonna go ruin the <UNK> man br br the film is just plain wrong and manages to get the most stupid simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting or ignoring that tom <UNK> john <UNK> bo luke duke were <UNK> <UNK> they had been <UNK> learned their lesson gone straight and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite <UNK> <UNK> from hunting <UNK> drive like steve mcqueen denver <UNK> uncle jessie was also the moral center of the family always <UNK> that the boys do good even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made <UNK> and coffee for when the <UNK> were done they always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest <UNK> about them that was quite appealing we wanted to be more like them than we were sorta my favorite gimmick from the show was how they always <UNK> their seat <UNK> before roaring off which was apparently too moral for this film br br by <UNK> the duke family into a pack of <UNK> <UNK> criminally minded redneck <UNK> misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint where the show was all about how honest or <UNK> the dukes were are the duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys i wanted to punch them both in the nose they seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing <UNK> back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who haven't grown up there should be no marijuana use no <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their breasts no <UNK> involving the brothers in da hood all of it looks like the work of a marketing <UNK> who took a <UNK> at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies the problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show imho shouldn't be seeing this movie either and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers director producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money which is exactly how i feel what were they thinking br br and boy did they ever get daisy wrong jessica simpson all <UNK> up like a pamela anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace but you can service your needs just fine <UNK> some <UNK> stills of her <UNK> them up <UNK> them to the wall in a <UNK> she is hardly in the film at all which is the movie's only saving grace and the ten minutes or so they used her was still excessive catherine <UNK> daisy may have had the same kind of shorts and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her but the daisy she played was a person the <UNK> she <UNK> by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it she remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home and most importantly she was a sweet caring person who couldn't help it if the guys went <UNK> <UNK> over her br br by contrast jessica simpson appears phony contrived made up <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bored out of place and i don't think she even looks that great in the outfit she doesn't look like a person but a plot device <UNK> up during a deal with someone representing her agent ms simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened whatever the joke was she isn't in on it and is <UNK> exploited for t a if that's all she wants from her career executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least because this effort was just pathetic br br the bottom line is skip it for the cost of two tickets and a <UNK> to go you can pick up one of warner bros excellent box set <UNK> of the original shows on dvd and the entire family can watch them together that was why it worked the only real purpose i can see in the film might be it's future use as an <UNK> tool at <UNK> bay twenty minutes of this they'll be singing a choir br br 1 10 and i mean it and stay the hell away from the <UNK> man you <UNK>
<START> an utterly beautiful film one of a handful of i saw when young that <UNK> me then and still do in <UNK> case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time by the <UNK> my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art house cinema  when it had finished we came out <UNK> eyed with heads full of poetry and <UNK> <UNK> stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again br br idealistic prince ahmad wants to <UNK> it amongst his people for a while to check things out but evil <UNK> <UNK> takes his chance to <UNK> him and <UNK> the throne after escaping with a little thief played by <UNK> ahmad spots a princess and they fall <UNK> in love  along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for <UNK> and love not only <UNK> but <UNK> everything the special effects must have been <UNK> in 1940 but time has taken its <UNK> and <UNK> their impact especially since digital <UNK> has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from 40 years later anyway if i'm <UNK> to suspend disbelief in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flying horses and <UNK> i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects favourite bits the dreamy scene in the <UNK> garden when ahmad reveals himself and <UNK> <UNK> suitably romantic song the stunning colours in the <UNK> in the land of legend  in fact the stunning colours throughout <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but still <UNK> finale conrad <UNK> played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever this and casablanca and then died john justin and june <UNK> were great in the leading roles of lovers both of them slightly and <UNK> stilted but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions only pure love <UNK> br br there's a couple of mildly violent images in it but rest assured this is a glorious <UNK> experience with a 100 positive message it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer one of my top 10 film favourites i can't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time
<START> picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market was pretty excited br br i found it fascinating for about 15 min then just repetitive and dull br br it is neat seeing mick and the gang in their prime i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so i could hear what there are saying and playing br br the skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple sort of poorly written monty python on acid i spent more time looking at the late 60's england back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skits br br this movie is a good reminder that times really change and what was important quickly becomes just plain silly good song but it has now been played to death by this dvd
<START> the first movie is pretty good this one is pretty bad br br <UNK> a lot of footage including the opening credits and end title from criminally insane the new footage shot on video really sticks out as poorly done scenes lack proper lighting the sound is sometimes nearly <UNK> there's even video <UNK> like the picture rolling and so on br br like all bad sequels it basically just repeats the story of the first one <UNK> kills everybody who shares her living space often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants br br at least it is only an extra on the dvd for the first one which also includes the same director's film <UNK> black wedding too bad it doesn't include the death nurse movies though
<START> frequently voted <UNK> greatest film ever by chinese critics as well as chinese film <UNK> from the outside and frankly i don't get it at all what i saw was one of the most generic <UNK> imaginable <UNK> directed and acted with a complete <UNK> for a protagonist <UNK> <UNK> don't laugh is that <UNK> a young married woman who has suffered alongside her <UNK> husband <UNK> <UNK> for the past several years it is post wwii and they live with the husband's teenage sister <UNK> zhang in a <UNK> home with not much money the man had been wealthy when they married along comes the husband's old best friend <UNK> li who also used to be the wife's boyfriend when they were teens she considers running away from her husband with this man while the husband pretty much remains oblivious thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend that's the set up and it doesn't go anywhere you wouldn't expect it to i've actually seen the remake directed by blue <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> it runs a half hour longer and is actually kind of dull too but at least it was pretty this supposed classic is pretty <UNK>
<START> the title is <UNK> the sound of a <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> it is <UNK> for all that the people who live in the dump cannot have the misery of those people is illustrated by the passing <UNK> which represents the relatively <UNK> rich life of the middle class the pathos of the little boy and his beloved yet sadly insane father is most touching this was <UNK> first film in colour and he uses beautifully shocking <UNK> colours seen only in dreams the movie is surreal and <UNK> in beauty the compassion for humanity is the <UNK> force but as always kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film it is a <UNK> by a genius of cinema
<START> the first half of this version was the best i've seen and i think i've seen every version of jane eyre ever made the development of jane's childhood and character were exceptional then it was as though someone said uh oh this is running too long and <UNK> the rest of the story to <UNK> the major scenes when included at all are <UNK> over combined and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline there was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope and then the end <UNK> it
<START> lets start off by saying that <UNK> <UNK> is just a pathetic movie i agree with the last person who said i missed the <UNK> lol br br the jokes were just terrible performances were average something went terribly wrong with the film <UNK> totally deserved something better all <UNK> <UNK> did was expose <UNK> <UNK> was ok <UNK> <UNK> was ok too br br mann <UNK> <UNK> is a desperate guy who wants to become famous therefore he uses <UNK> and pretends he loves her only because her father is a music director and could help him become famous since the father <UNK> everything his daughter says one day mann and his friends go to <UNK> to have some fun there he meets <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and totally falls for her looks and tries to <UNK> with her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br then that night <UNK> cannot open the door to her room and mann decides to help her seeing that he cannot as well <UNK> goes to ask for help while she is gone mann is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sits on her bed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comes in and they have a one night stand however in that one night stand <UNK> falls in love with him that morning they spot the underworld don <UNK> who sees it all the don loves <UNK> and couldn't stand what he saw he orders them to get married and being frightened mann <UNK> the order and <UNK> <UNK> then their marriage news ends up in the newspaper mann is later finds out that he loves <UNK> after they do a music video together he is now trapped between love and fame <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie is horrible the songs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is fantastic the <UNK> version is even better <UNK> <UNK> is also great the title track is also awesome guys avoid watching this movie
<START> i saw a trailer for this on <UNK> <UNK> the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african americans it looked like what it is a highly <UNK> wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay it would seem that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wife has left him for his brother who works with him at the store back in phoenix he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles br br so as <UNK> arrives norman wearing nothing but <UNK> blue bikini shorts gets out of his <UNK> to answer the door trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the <UNK> floor norman tries to wake his lover who <UNK> refuses to <UNK> it was just to the point where i wrote why won't he wake up when suddenly he does and me and my friend's jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue eyed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> white live in lover who just had the most <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> queen of a type that can only be imagined as <UNK> from 1976 l a he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry and seems to have <UNK> both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch br br norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit <UNK> goes to stay with <UNK> flowers and <UNK> answers the phone when norman calls br br so <UNK> attempts to reach his wife in mexico while he is on the phone <UNK> comes in to pack his dress and <UNK> confronts him with a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his <UNK> revelation but sounding more like we're about to hear a very special track by the emotions he realizes that his son is gay br br his first <UNK> is i'll kill him i'll kill him then <UNK> goes on a long walk <UNK> he <UNK> through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon his thoughts are all <UNK> by something he sees on his walk for instance a <UNK> truck driver appearing just as he is <UNK> what makes a real man surprisingly he goes to a <UNK> and buys about eight books on homosexuality this it must be said is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought he then goes straight to a park <UNK> and reads them all br br <UNK> then hires audrey a six foot amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> jones he hired her for norman to try out <UNK> but this <UNK> norman and he <UNK> out to go stay with his friend melody br br then <UNK> comes over and offers to take <UNK> out for the night he <UNK> over the loss of <UNK> wife and tells the tale of his own mother who <UNK> an irrational prejudice against <UNK> because she was <UNK> at a <UNK> they attend a long featured performance of <UNK> and <UNK> which <UNK> in <UNK> violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose once more mouths were <UNK> br br so it seems that wouldn't ya just know it <UNK> and <UNK> have a wonderful evening together you see <UNK> traditional older black men just have to see the crappy highly <UNK> entertainment of mega queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer it's really just that simple this still does not prevent <UNK> from yelling rape when <UNK> wakes him from a bad dream it ends less predictably than you'd think br br there was so much that was just off what is the basis of norman and <UNK> 's relationship they don't seem to have any <UNK> and norman has no <UNK> whatsoever about kicking <UNK> out and even when he comes around to stand up for himself he never <UNK> <UNK> or talks about their relationship there were some kind of <UNK> quaint touches like <UNK> going to buy all those books on homosexuality <UNK> sitting right down on the park <UNK> to read them i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality rather than just run off to get drunk or <UNK> with his friends br br other than that it's kind of just what it seems like a little <UNK> of a <UNK> era an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag <UNK> performance we could all learn to love and understand one another and because of the whole <UNK> of this thing the extreme stereotypes and message laden dialogue just come off as <UNK> outdated and provide a great deal of <UNK> for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that <UNK> female friends are desperately in love with them and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with and by <UNK> <UNK> them br br hey check out cinema de <UNK> my website on bad and cheesy movies with a few good movies thrown in you can find the <UNK> in my email address above
<START> love at the top the utterly <UNK> american title for the superb french film le <UNK> <UNK> which means i think the <UNK> sheep is such an original movie the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more astounding this film was far ahead of its time even by today's highest standards it <UNK> things that seem rich and new filmed by the hugely underrated director michel <UNK> it rather defies description in the way it combines social critique comedy mystery love sex and satire into one wholly original mix leaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable the cast is splendid <UNK> the writing and theme but it's <UNK> delicious tone keeping you constantly off balance but <UNK> that pushes this lost film to a very high level indeed the written interview with the director on the special features section of the dvd is definitely worth reading if you have the time
<START> renowned cinematographer <UNK> francis glory the elephant man directs this pretty bad horror drama film 19th century england has a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled than dr thomas rock the law stating that only the bodies of hung criminals can be studied and <UNK> on but the <UNK> of these bodies is a small one and rock needs more and he prefers them <UNK> being a maverick within his circle he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on desperate <UNK> robert fallon and timothy <UNK> get wind of this job opportunity and begin to murder people and sell these bodies to rock naturally this kind of action has even worse consequences than practicing on the dead bodies of non criminals and leads to trouble for everyone while the overall story sounds intriguing on paper almost everything about the doctor and the <UNK> is laughably bad br br after the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch the film the entire look of the film is just ugly seeing as how the film takes place in the <UNK> of england during the 19th century the filmmakers were probably going for an ugly look but they don't do it in an <UNK> way everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap feeble and disgusting also just about everything scene is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously and most of the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous francis sure didn't help out his actors much br br jonathan <UNK> and stephen rea play the twisted buddies of the film fallon and <UNK> respectively and are very <UNK> but very bad their characters are by nature crazy but <UNK> and rea <UNK> the parts to death they especially have trouble keeping the same accent from shot to shot <UNK> in particular goes from cockney to irish to long john silver to some kind of <UNK> creature and so on and so forth it's also a humor riot to see <UNK> in this film at all let alone playing an in demand street whore since she can't act to save her life though her song during the final credits isn't so funny boy she sure came a long way from flower power to i'll take <UNK> clothes off for a <UNK> as bad as those three actors are in this film julian <UNK> takes home the award for the worst performance of the film he is just as lame as it gets giving one laugh out loud attempt after another at portraying anger love happiness anxiety pick an emotion any emotion br br there's only one good thing about the doctor and the <UNK> timothy <UNK> performance of dr rock despite being surrounded by cinematic <UNK> dalton is quite excellent giving an electric portrayal of an overly driven yet good natured man too bad the rest of the film could not have been as good as mr dalton
<START> i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier it <UNK> <UNK> anything else on those <UNK> moon nights cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay what you don't know what a <UNK> moon is
<START> <UNK> bleak and depressing the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> controversial novel of the same name like many french films its manner is one of <UNK> <UNK> but it is painfully slow or should that be slowly painful while this is an excellent and challenging film it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the <UNK> mood to see it
<START> this movie was extremely funny i would like to own this for my vintage collection of 1970s movie must see again list i know this cast of characters they are people that i have met over the years and that <UNK> me to search out this comedy unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs <UNK> foxx always a clown of comedy pearl <UNK> a great match as his wife witty and sassy norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out dennis <UNK> crazy funny man miss <UNK> hooker with a heart and little conscience love lust strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back <UNK> performance situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible except jerry seinfeld playing dennis <UNK> role this <UNK> a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to <UNK> pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent this movie was a wild ride advise of a <UNK> remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his <UNK> over his lawyer episode from seinfeld the parents have there jaw dropping moment fun over fun it is screaming bring me back
<START> first of all let me comment that the audience loved it from the first moment perhaps current events in the middle east led people to take the attitude i came for a comedy and by george i'm going to enjoy it but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it the last few times woody has tried to do a straight comedy small time crooks curse of the <UNK> <UNK> hollywood ending i've felt like the one liners felt strained and a bit <UNK> i remember thinking at one point that would have been funny in the early sixties so going in to this movie i was afraid woody was becoming tone deaf however in this one his comic sensibilities were in perfect tune admittedly there were plenty of my fellow <UNK> card carrying folks in the screening but there were also plenty of 20 somethings and 30 somethings as well and they all seemed to get it and give up the occasional belly laugh in addition to numerous <UNK> chuckles and the like in many instances the throw <UNK> had people laughing so loud you missed the next line br br <UNK> woody was <UNK> familiar ground as i suspected from the trailer this film had a lot of manhattan murder mystery in it but then again there was more than a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> new york stories alice and even a little tribute to broadway danny rose at the very beginning br br even with woody in the movie scarlett as sondra was at times the woody <UNK> but her character was far from the <UNK> that say will ferrell gave us in melinda and melinda or kenneth <UNK> attempted in celebrity instead of <UNK> <UNK> and quirks <UNK> <UNK> comes directly from the family history which she shares early on on numerous occasions the family business leads her to <UNK> that we get as an audience while the characters on the screen can only perceive them as strange non <UNK> since we are all in on the joke we can't help but laugh but the laughs don't come from <UNK> the woody <UNK> but truly from the character to a great extent unlike farrell <UNK> cusack or even <UNK> <UNK> before her scarlett is not required to use the woody voice to evoke the woody role thus we don't find ourselves ripped out of the narrative as a <UNK> voice suddenly emerges from someone <UNK> face br br as my friend commented on the way out sid the character played by woody is a supporting role but more center stage than i was hoping going in however this time woody seems to have written a character that truly fits his current persona unlike his ed <UNK> <UNK> character in anything else or his blind director in hollywood ending this time the character is a comfortable fit perhaps more importantly this time the character works in the story within the <UNK> circles they find themselves in he is even more fish out of water than scarlett which is used to great comedic effect throughout sid is a <UNK> <UNK> magician playing to small audiences but the fact that he is from another era is placed front and center for our enjoyment br br but what about jackman what about ian <UNK> <UNK> i liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece i particularly liked <UNK> short but effective turns jackman is charming with the ease of old money that was so often portrayed in films from 50 years ago class echoes from purple rose of <UNK> br br so what did i think short answer maybe his best straight comedy since <UNK> bullets over broadway less stylized than mighty <UNK> less <UNK> than <UNK> harry less forced than small time crooks or hollywood ending woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the 21st century
<START> devil hunter gained <UNK> for the fact that it's on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> list but it really <UNK> have been many films on the list where there for god and <UNK> only known reasons and while this isn't the <UNK> of the bunch there isn't a lot here that <UNK> <UNK> which is a shame because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping <UNK> the plot actually gives the film a decent base or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle a hunter is then hired to find her but along the way he has to brave the natives lead by a man who calls himself the devil hence the title the film basically just <UNK> along for <UNK> five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest it's a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and she kills in ecstasy but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst <UNK> of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say i've seen everything on the <UNK> list just two more to go and i'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it saw it but if you're not on the <UNK> for <UNK> there really is no reason to bother with this one
<START> i can agree with other comments that there wasn't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn't a documentary it was meant to entertain and i think it did a very good job at it br br i agree with the black family the scenes with them seemed out of place like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good br br despite it wasn't a re <UNK> of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch
<START> even though this movie came out a year before i was born it is <UNK> one of my favorite comedies it stars <UNK> foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality like most parents he doesn't know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like his son norman is now grown up and living on his own when his father ben finds out that his son is gay he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie when ben gets to <UNK> apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it's his son in drag norman is that you the movie had me laughing from start to finish <UNK> foxx is great although a lot of the content is stereotypical i didn't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled and it even has a good ending highly recommended
<START> in a word excellent this is the movie go and see it the director ron howard i mean the director ron howard did a fantastic job as he usually does an incredible attention to detail vivid colors and <UNK> breathtaking <UNK> atmosphere astonishing variety of costumes wait there's more to it than that the story is very good too there's clearly a message to be <UNK> from it by the thoughtful viewers jim carrey is top notch he is probably the best grinch possible the girl taylor <UNK> is real good i'm sure she has some great future the dog is cool all in all it's a very high quality christmas fairy tale if you like fairy tales it's for you if you like christmas it's for you br br reading some other reviews here get a life it hurts me every time to see people out there who well got their hearts two <UNK> too small
<START> flight of fury takes the <UNK> of being the very worst steven seagal flick i've ever seen up to now br br it's a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest seagal isn't really trying in this he's fat and his voice is dubbed once more br br the co stars fare no better being a rather sorry load of 3rd <UNK> br br the direction by <UNK> is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he's also responsible for another couple of seagal <UNK> shadow man attack force the screenplay co written by seagal himself is laughably inept br br according to imdb <UNK> was spent on this boring load of old <UNK> if these figures are correct i sense a big tax <UNK> as nowhere near that amount was spent br br flight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael <UNK> flick black thunder which has to be better than this tripe br br this has no redeeming qualities whatsoever give it a miss 1 2 out of
<START> henry <UNK> nightmare weekend is a rotten piece of <UNK> from troma this is a juvenile sloppy and stupid low budget horror film about some teenage girls spending the weekend at a mansion the <UNK> evil assistant <UNK> the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform hideous experiments using a brain <UNK> she transforms her victims and their dates into zombies nightmare weekend is a completely <UNK> piece of garbage that features lots of nudity and some cheesy gore not to mention a laughable musical score the acting is horrendous and the script is utterly incoherent why such piece of crap is widely distributed is beyond me avoid it like the plague 1 out of 10
<START> if you find yourself in need of an escape something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world domino will satisfy that need this is entertainment after all the plot keeps your brain in motion one of those movies like usual suspects where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out i wondered about domino harvey herself how her life became of interest to hollywood as for the acting lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well not once did i think of <UNK> in a soccer uniform or pirate costume and granted mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and often but here despite the violence he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people
<START> spoilers i loved the later episodes from college and on but i wish i could get the last season on dvd unfortunately the latest i could get is the first college season still the teenage years were sweet although they focused a lot on magic they also made her into a character that teens could relate to <UNK> with the <UNK> of teens and children in divorced families this show was very innocent they did not get into the morbid teenage problems such as sex and drugs but they did <UNK> with pressure to fit in i loved watching her grow up and cope with her magic on her own and trying to convince her aunts to let go as she left the nest the older episodes were cute but it was just so much better to see her as well not really a teenage witch anymore but an adult witch i loved <UNK> and <UNK> they were so talented in the earlier episodes the aunts were great actresses but they were so strict kind and loving but they treated her like a young child in some ways but not in every way i mean they grounded her for every little mistake she made with her magic i mean let her learn from her own mistakes for once that was what i liked about the college episodes she was able to learn from her own mistakes without be grounded over everything that was annoying not to put down <UNK> and <UNK> melissa joan hard is beautiful and was perfect for the sabrina with her <UNK> personality i liked the last episode where she ran off the marry harvey but as somebody else said it would have been nice to see what happened after i mean i believe it was obvious they were getting married where else would they be running off to in her wedding dress but i would have liked to have seen it i supposed they wanted to leave it up to the viewer to choose the ending though rather than <UNK> feeding it to us as most comedies do somebody said they could have shown them marry and go to school in the house but they already <UNK> college sabrina had great job for a magazine and i think harvey had a good job because he lived in a nice apartment that we only see at the end but they never say what he does as a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an <UNK> like his dad when <UNK> moved into the house that season they never really explain how it happened actually there is a lot the show does not explain but i supposed it is supposed to be to leave it up to us and give it some mystery prior to sabrina and her friends moving into the house they show <UNK> getting married and this whole spell that ends up with <UNK> turning into a child <UNK> comes back in the last episode and <UNK> is there in some other form but beth is not on the episode but they do not show <UNK> husband or what happened like did they have children maybe they didn't want too much going on in one episode i also liked <UNK> sister who played her spoiled cousin she was pretty and a great actress and it was interesting to see her grown up i cannon believe it has been six years since the show went off the air i still love the reruns also i don't know if anybody noticed this but in the earlier episodes the town was called <UNK> a made up town i believe which was supposed to be close to <UNK> but in the later episodes they don't mention the name of the town being <UNK> <UNK> and i think they call it boston unless that is just where she worked also i wanted to add i found the episode wild wild sabrina where she is taught about the importance of rules to be insulting she was 18 and too old to be grounded i would have been insulted if my parents grounded me at 18 and i think while an 18 year old might mess up how she did they need to learn the consequences on their own i think at 18 they know rules are important
<START> i am so appalled by this documentary i am deeply embarrassed and ashamed by the way <UNK> were portrayed this documentary was not about the culture of <UNK> it was about the culture of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are two different cultures very different cultures and should not be <UNK> to the puerto <UNK> population <UNK> before you make a documentary you need to do the research you also need to check and make sure your sources are credible puerto <UNK> are not all loud and they do have class which is one thing the documentary lacked to show when i saw <UNK> and <UNK> on the view and <UNK> on martha stewart i was very excited about watching i even made sure to let my parents know since they love puerto rico so much after the first five minutes i could not believe how the documentary <UNK> the us and made puerto <UNK> look like a bunch of guinea pigs you need to go and visit puerto rico and you will see that puerto rico is not a 3rd world country where more than 50 of the population is in poverty puerto rico has <UNK> and well known <UNK> roads cars shopping centers <UNK> the largest <UNK> and <UNK> i've ever seen <UNK> theaters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hilton etc <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> auto <UNK> and <UNK> just to name a few poverty not 50 of the population is puerto <UNK> culture is about family music food celebrating and trying to move forward not <UNK> oh and new cousins don't just pop up out of no where no that is not a puerto <UNK> thing that is a ghetto thing we are not <UNK> parents of <UNK> descent who would like to teach their children about puerto rico should <UNK> in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what puerto rico is all about they will see its beauty people and culture please don't show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with <UNK> oh and please don't tell your american friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the <UNK> people look ignorant br br yes i am born and raised puerto <UNK> from the island just so you know
<START> home room came as a total surprise not having a clue as to what it was all about it paid off big time because it doesn't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to <UNK> his class mates who are the innocent victims of his <UNK> actions br br paul ryan the director who is working and editing his own material is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast br br alicia <UNK> is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school she has been away a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students for one she is a rebel with a punk look lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who <UNK> to come near her <UNK> alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died supposedly killed by her boyfriend alicia we realize is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life but we are not given any clues to that effect br br what follows is the aftermath of the tragedy as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it deanna <UNK> is a wealthy teen <UNK> who shouldn't have been at the school at all when a <UNK> bullet hit her she is <UNK> with more than a wound she is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't let her forget br br alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal since she doesn't <UNK> with the police the head of the school wants her to see deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will <UNK> up and will tell the authorities what she knows alicia <UNK> deanna but in a matter of days both girls will make peace we don't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school br br busy phillips makes an excellent alicia and erika <UNK> is equally good as deanna victor <UNK> james <UNK> taylor holland and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble br br the film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred which helps the tone that mr ryan wanted to give this movie
<START> this is probably the most boring worse and useless film i have seen last year the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with plenty of clichés the lone wolf cop good looking psychologically disturbed sleeping with his gun nice hard worker and shy but good looking she scientist you add a 2 <UNK> plot and you have i robot i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc this movie stinks the <UNK> and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 <UNK> i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy if you have some spare time watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book
<START> let's keep it simple my two kids were glued to this movie it has its flaws from an adult perspective but buy some <UNK> worms and just enjoy it br br and the <UNK> girl was excellent br br and <UNK> williams was pretty gosh <UNK> hot although she's not in the film very much so don't get too excited there br br not that's it's really a bad thing but it is the kind of movie you watch just once don't buy the dvd br br enjoy br br did i mention <UNK> williams that was for the <UNK>
<START> this film was very well advertised i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then i went and saw it i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i <UNK> feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in plus i wanted to get my <UNK> worth out of the movie i always go into a movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it <UNK> the worst movie i've ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you <UNK> seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead
<START> in the third entry of the phantasm series mike and <UNK> continue chasing the tall man <UNK> by a trigger happy 9 year old a black g i jane and the spirit of <UNK> deceased brother he died in the original phantasm number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in phantasm ii i got the feeling the stress was merely laid on <UNK> incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand up comedian the humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and <UNK> which fits a story like this better also the settings aren't as macabre here plus the constant presence of the tall man <UNK> <UNK> isn't as <UNK> there still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time by the way beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off screen the entire phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of don <UNK> who wrote and directed 4 episodes so <UNK> fifth being in production the first one is a semi cult classic the second is a horror feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be <UNK> a michael baldwin returns as mike even though james <UNK> portrayed his character a lot better in phantasm ii
<START> i have a feeling that the <UNK> bros depression era musicals are going to become a lot more <UNK> in the next couple of years yes we are in the economic <UNK> or have you been living under a rock and times look bleak but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles in the 30's film going was hugely popular even at the height of economic <UNK> <UNK> parade 1933 was one such film that audiences <UNK> to while this lloyd bacon directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as gold <UNK> of 1933 1933 does it's still a wonderful showcase of talent we have to wait until the end of the film for the three <UNK> busby <UNK> <UNK> numbers but boy are they worth waiting for me yes little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress and her <UNK> is so so but <UNK> magical by a <UNK> <UNK> her and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls into a <UNK> water wonderland of course <UNK> numbers could never really be performed on a stage they defy limits of gravity for one thing and they contrast <UNK> with the realism of the tough <UNK> non musical scenes and <UNK> also has james cagney in at the one of his all too few musicals really what couldn't this man do he even gets to take over from the leading man don sailor <UNK> and <UNK> over <UNK> shanghai <UNK> who is really little ruby in china girl wig he co stars with joan blondell his adorable <UNK> secretary who cagney somehow <UNK> in favour of other women until the final reel that is apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife and you can see the mutual <UNK> in every scene
<START> anna lives with her family in a new <UNK> estate just outside the city she has been with her husband <UNK> for years and they don't talk so much anymore while on a working visit abroad a female colleague commits suicide anna is deeply impressed by her death even though she hardly knew her nobody seems to know why she took her own life for the first time anna realizes that one can be an unknown among your most <UNK> anna doesn't mention the incident back home and starts <UNK> her husband and child <UNK> is the story of a woman who suddenly starts looking at her own life and she wonders how she got so <UNK> apart from the people closest to her br br this is my translation of the dvd cover text synopsis i hope you find it useful as this movie doesn't have an imdb plot summary yet at this date
<START> firstly i am not easily scared by anything except for my few <UNK> but this movie is absolutely horrific this is not appropriate for children at all i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i couldn't believe how gory it was for a children's movie <UNK> being brutally murdered it's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g i recommend being over 8 to see this but don't get me wrong it was probably a good movie if i wasn't <UNK> mentally as a child i cannot believe a parent would allow a let's say 4 year old child to watch this it's just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids i'm <UNK> over 4 and i was shocked by the violence i don't recommend
<START> well i don't know where to begin obviously this was a made for tv movie so my expectations were low i was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of movie br br and talk about bad chemistry between the <UNK> <UNK> detectives br br i would go more in depth but this movie doesn't really deserve it grade d imdb rating 3 10
<START> first off the movie was not true to facts at all i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it first of all <UNK> was a genius at <UNK> and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was <UNK> and who found love at the end and so on also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong the scene where he <UNK> around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it in my opinion russell <UNK> didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent <UNK> type therefore he really couldn't play one it would have been great if it would have focused more on the <UNK> similar to <UNK> and not the over <UNK> <UNK> at this level <UNK> was too hollywood ish and too superficial to be great personally i think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we lesser <UNK> 5 10
<START> i loved this film not being a <UNK> ed wood jr fan i prefer to appreciate his <UNK> enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings his movies are fun but his personal story is one <UNK> with pain i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his <UNK> life rather than simply <UNK> him with <UNK> praise from beginning to end this film <UNK> from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr br br what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as <UNK> we get insight into <UNK> personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making br br the film itself is shot in a low budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most <UNK> released movies from 1996 would be <UNK> sort of like wearing a <UNK> suit than the president the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background br br fans will be excited to hear personal <UNK> regarding ed wood <UNK> and new <UNK> will be amazed that this man was real the dvd is full of impossible to find gems <UNK> of <UNK> and photo <UNK> but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and <UNK> story br br ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be <UNK> in her pool this ability to define a person's legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr but also to give a <UNK> view of the community that he created somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement br br even the title hints at the b list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever <UNK> into an <UNK> cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting <UNK> with <UNK> legend br br in many ways a living <UNK> ed wood jr could not be <UNK> to a single viewpoint this <UNK> effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get being itself a <UNK> of themes it is at once <UNK> provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling
<START> i have never seen a movie as bad as this it is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is not funny if you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 if it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom 100 br br
<START> <UNK> ryan frankie thomas gets out of <UNK> school and goes back to the <UNK> his sister ann sheridan does her best to keep him out of trouble but it just seems to follow him aside from his <UNK> with the <UNK> gang <UNK> is followed by real life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance they need someone to blame for the <UNK> and <UNK> is it it is up to the <UNK> to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just <UNK> br br the the scene that introduces the dead end kids is really quite good the boys wander on over to the new <UNK> furniture on the street and proceed to make it their own they talk to each other in <UNK> posh accents and talk about drinking tea together bernard <UNK> takes a <UNK> in a chair the boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy but after he proves himself a good fighter they ask him to join their club br br the <UNK> scene is rather good too filled with <UNK> that seems dangerous at first but is really rather clever and innocent br br later when billy <UNK> studies to become the boy mayor he has a dream about <UNK> this is wonderfully staged with tiny <UNK> of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him br br angels wash their faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of angels with dirty faces and really tells what the kids are doing notorious for bad behavior on and off the set these boys make nice in this film but rather than seem <UNK> it makes for some great laughs this is a preview of what many of the boys would become in the <UNK> boys series we even get a few <UNK> words from leo <UNK>
<START> a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie so naturally i was <UNK> when this movie came out in 1994 i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away <UNK> and <UNK> the anticipation that <UNK> true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess a red <UNK> <UNK> gun is better to get than a chinese top and it is not very funny at all charles <UNK> is good but the buck stops there bottom line 1 star don't even bother
<START> this movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen however this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or <UNK> of this mess it almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid if you don't want to feel <UNK> you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved they've all seen better days but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film i can't go on enough about this horrible movie its almost something that ed wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece br br to start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen heard this thing has got to be five minutes long on top of that it is narrated as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read then we meet mr slater and the <UNK> of terrible lines gets <UNK> it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line soon we meet stephen <UNK> who i typically enjoy and he does his best not to <UNK> in this but ultimately he does then comes the ultimate insult tara reid playing an intelligent role oh help us tara reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the american pie type br br all in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video i know that i got a kick out of it i mean lets all be honest here sometimes its <UNK> to <UNK> in the shortcomings of others
<START> an excellent <UNK> i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80's this movie is for anyone that wasn't around during that time period this shows the one thing the african american gay <UNK> felt was solely theirs and the love and <UNK> you see is real the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the <UNK> eighties that time is gone forever this is a good pre <UNK> thug movie when queens were really proud to be <UNK> goodbye to <UNK> this is another era gone but greatly documented all <UNK> film
<START> this film is moving without being sentimental meaningful without being pretentious it tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart as the <UNK> of technology and an <UNK> society make the family run business increasingly <UNK> br br the acting is wonderful though none of us in the west are likely to have heard of these actors we should have long ago they play their characters with honesty and <UNK> these are flawed characters each with major weaknesses but with such utter humanity and kindness that it's impossible not to become engaged in the story br br we need more films like this we need more western filmmakers creating films such as this
<START> gloria victor and <UNK> reed in space girl costumes br br i love 50 sci fi i even love cheesy 50s sci fi but this film is really really bad and not in a mst3k kinda way br br virtually unwatchable as a couple of <UNK> do their best hip cat impression of <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> can usually save cheesy sci fi such as in cat women on the moon but it can't in this case this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature br br that said i could watch gloria and <UNK> walk around the space ship for about an hour or so
<START> without a doubt private lessons ii is the greatest movie i have ever seen a japanese <UNK> poorly translated into english its a joy to watch not much of it makes sense but that doesn't matter it's the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funny br br the film is rare and <UNK> on video but i have caught it a couple of time late late at night on pay cable my taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as i slowly person by person introduce this film gem to the world br br joanna <UNK> plays the <UNK> lover to ken our hero she apparently was just working for her check ken is played by <UNK> <UNK> of the japanese pop band <UNK> who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie <UNK> <UNK> of in the company of men fame shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwards br br it takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is on repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the <UNK> amount of <UNK> ken has in his house at least 50 or that ken is wearing a shirt with <UNK> <UNK> of corn in the movie's finale br br the movie is predictable but highly <UNK> my friends and i <UNK> entire scenes yes it sounds like we're lame losers and we are but we're lame losers who have seen private lessons ii be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie you'll thank me for it
<START> i'd always wanted david <UNK> to go into the movie business and finally he did and he made me proud this movie lived up to what i had hoped for <UNK> played his character very well managing to remain consistent with something new instead of playing the agent <UNK> we are used to therefore i give him extra credit for his role also because i could not see anyone else playing that particular character david was great but nothing compared to the psychotic timothy <UNK> a brilliant performance that you don't get tired of throughout the movie because he never fails to surprise you he has weaknesses and strengths making the story all the more believable i also very much enjoyed the narration it added to the story a good deal and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time this movie also had a <UNK> score i <UNK> this for anyone who likes drama and doesn't mind blood
<START> cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews as if it were a mediocre movie of some run of the mill <UNK> br br the movie is great funny crazy over the top violent though with minimum gore and all the way energetic to the core loved every single bit of it can't remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off and now the most important thing at least to me it is computer effects free when i watch some hollywood actors <UNK> it out on screen in modern high resolution and damn high budgeted action <UNK> a russian word that means bull <UNK> i understand that any <UNK> child can do it you can <UNK> the <UNK> to the body add some cute pc effects and stuff it into the action film here it is different i don't think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide who can repeat the <UNK> that takes place at the end of the film or the chinese football play and it is just a little hong kong cinema made for fun not pretending to be star wars br br having a dvd with english soundtrack is not a problem with this movie it does not spoil the atmosphere to me br br can't help mentioning a very neat theatrical play some of you suppose won't like it as to me it's amazing have a look at the <UNK> friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in his left side of the head his face expression changes into something whimsical and he comes up to dragon with a baby expression and take a look at the menacing size of his mouth it's nearly from one ear to the other long when he makes <UNK> br br this movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world very thankful to our russian industry for the releases of classic jackie chan movies his modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype br br total 10 out of 10 a legendary movie in its genre thank you for attention
<START> <UNK> this one was a bit painful to sit through it has a cute and amusing premise but it all goes to hell from there matthew <UNK> is almost always pedestrian and annoying and he does not disappoint in this one deborah <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> turned in surprisingly decent performances alan bates and jennifer <UNK> among others played it way over the top i know that's the way the parts were written and it's hard to blame actors when the script and director have them do such schlock if you're going to have outrageous characters that's ok but you gotta have good material to make it work it didn't here run away screaming from this movie if at all possible
<START> in <UNK> paris <UNK> a computer generated system controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped detective <UNK> craig must go against <UNK> to find her br br renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a <UNK> futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking <UNK> with a noir themed ideology and <UNK> montages that should delight many br br pixar are the animation masters their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the <UNK> wall e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their <UNK> renaissance isn't a film aimed for the young audience though and like <UNK> <UNK> brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation br br in 2005 robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that <UNK> up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd <UNK> of colour and a year later christian <UNK> took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making br br <UNK> picture however is a full on animation but it doesn't half look realistic for the majority of it's strong 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time the faces of the character's are well portrayed and in particular this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply <UNK> into the <UNK> faces as the shadows blend across their expressions it is almost a clever use of pathetic <UNK> and is finely directed also br br for anyone who has seen <UNK> you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly <UNK> artistic style by <UNK> <UNK> br br renaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood one scene in particular when <UNK> appears out of darkness is beautifully shot br br the narrative revolves around a stubborn and <UNK> political government who keeps <UNK> on every citizen the running of paris is down to the mysterious <UNK> which we don't see nearly enough to get an essence of its true <UNK> renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired <UNK> attempts to rescue the mysterious woman and then we see <UNK> tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements there are many things wrong with the scripting not to mention the tired <UNK> cop routine is now old but there is plenty of dashing <UNK> and <UNK> banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages
<START> to make any film about the supposed end of the world there should be some facts realism 1 we are never told why these people believe this 2 location is new years eve in toronto canada so please some one tell me why was then still shining at midnight why based on the costumes did it seem like september br br 3 the acting was in that neo <UNK> natural style that needed a director who knew how to do it br br 4 the individual story pieces were all dreary without any purpose i could go on but i do not want to make this as boring as the film br br rating 1 2 out of 4 2 on imdb scale br br thank you i am as always br br jay harris aka <UNK>
<START> yes this production is long good news for <UNK> fans and it has a somewhat dated feel but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won't want to watch any other versions br br timothy dalton is edward rochester it's that simple i don't care that other reviewers claim he's too handsome dalton is attractive certainly but no pretty boy in fact he possesses a <UNK> <UNK> dark charm that in my mind is quite in keeping with the mysterious very <UNK> mr r and he takes on <UNK> sad tortured persona so <UNK> he portrays <UNK> when the scene calls for it but also displays <UNK> tender passionate emotional side as well imo the newer a e production suffers in that <UNK> <UNK> whom i normally adore seems to <UNK> and bully his way throughout i've read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a <UNK> <UNK> beast br br when i <UNK> the novel i always see zelah clarke as jane ms clarke to me resembles jane as she describes herself and is described by others small <UNK> fairy though it's true the actress doesn't look 18 she portrays jane's attributes so well while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or <UNK> one must remember that the character spent 8 years at <UNK> being trained to hold her emotions and passionate nature in check her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen who was the picture of <UNK> <UNK> although her true nature was <UNK> jane learned to master her temper and appear <UNK> in keeping with the <UNK> aims for its charity students who would go into <UNK> jane becomes a <UNK> in the household of the rich mr rochester she would certainly not speak to him as an equal even later on when she gave as well as she got she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her <UNK> nevertheless if you read the book to which this production stays amazingly close you can clearly see the small struggles zelah as jane <UNK> as she <UNK> her emotions in order to remain mild and even <UNK> br br the chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right i think no it does not in the least resemble hollywood thank god it's not a hollywood sort of book but theirs is a romance which is true devoted and loyal and for a woman like jane who never presumed to have any love come her way it is a minor miracle br br the rest of the casting is terrific and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here so too is much of the rich poetic original dialogue this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely infamous <UNK> <UNK> and in general features more humor than other versions i've seen in particular the mutual <UNK> between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful br br jane eyre was in many ways one of the first <UNK> <UNK> she finally accepted love on her own terms and <UNK> and at last as <UNK> true equal just beautiful
<START> i remember when i first saw this movie i was in sixth grade when it happened before i saw this i had listened to the original broadway recording of it and i really loved it but when i saw this i was like what the heck this movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud who decided to do all of that br br i really am a very huge fan of gene kelly but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did the movie looked more like a hollywood set than the beautiful <UNK> of scotland and who the heck decided to cut all of <UNK> songs out of the movie br br i am willing to bet that when they saw this movie <UNK> and lowe were probably wondering who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece well they had a right to say that if they did they were probably mad at the fact that hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie br br song and acting wise mr kelly you passed the audition with flying colors but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text br br so in short if you want a good movie based on a musical by <UNK> lowe and alan jay <UNK> this one isn't it br br 3 10
<START> not exactly my genre this straight to dvd street fight action is one i only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers i'm relatively open minded and quite a fan of <UNK> walker so i sat back ready to enjoy myself br br blood and bone is the story of <UNK> bone an ex con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses blah blah blah br br what a tedious film i understand that films like this don't rely hugely on plot but do they have to stuff in such a silly predictable and entirely stupid storyline it may not be important but by <UNK> <UNK> does it annoy me better no plot and pure action than a <UNK> ridden <UNK> <UNK> of a narrative <UNK> with entirely <UNK> and <UNK> sentimental drivel it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin skinned turkey stuffed with rotten <UNK> i should probably at this point mention what is of course the film's drawing point the fighting even in itself the fighting is rather poor bone manages to take out well established tough man street fighters in single punches a large <UNK> or two is the <UNK> <UNK> attempt to <UNK> this <UNK> fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish <UNK> even this is repetitive and stupid arms broken and faces kicked with a steady <UNK> that we get to see time and time again br br a run of the mill film by numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to dvd status doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen time and time again and not even particularly well
<START> i suppose many people comment review their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible i'm writing due to the latter br br i was excited for the sequel to <UNK> i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content i felt it was worth watching more than once this being 2008 i had high hopes for what they would do with this film computers <UNK> terror military over <UNK> have all grown so much since the time of the first film and <UNK> the dead code had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick br br the movie failed on pretty much every level but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any <UNK> regarding the realism of <UNK> aspects the dead code was a 1990's air flight <UNK> with a few people on the ground waving their arms meanwhile will farmer is button <UNK> about 7 000 <UNK> none of which are <UNK> what is happening on the screen until finally he wins by <UNK> a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20 000 virtual people nobody is near the gas because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes this tells <UNK> the real life war machine that he is a high level terror threat br br even though any 5 16 year old could complete this same task the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity they say things like he has expert knowledge of bio terror he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 <UNK> of the <UNK> entry on bio terror so then a movie long chase scene with about <UNK> of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues they have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter sometimes they are mad they barely miss him but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him br br ugh i would write more but i already wasted 1 5 hours watching this i would rather watch the <UNK> and joshua play <UNK> <UNK> toe for 1 5 hours
<START> as someone else commented this is a feel good movie it's got glorious scenery and the wonder filled voice of <UNK> i've seen this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon i'd forgotten how much i miss <UNK> singing of <UNK> <UNK> and i need to get out the cd it's a great movie to just while away the afternoon <UNK> in fun and <UNK> eddie albert is grand as the agent and a bit over the top but all agents are just that anyway the italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view if you need acting of olivier <UNK> this movie isn't for you if you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music watch this film just enjoy
<START> <UNK> is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard set in <UNK> india this film shows the true reality of <UNK> india <UNK> gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go her freedom personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is simply brilliant as her <UNK> <UNK> there several moments in the film where one is brought to tears the film at points is deeply traumatic some of the <UNK> scenes are spine chilling yet <UNK> <UNK> and survival are both remarkable from a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations a remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling
<START> i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version everything from the acting the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera to the camera shots all medium or close up shots no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots were absolutely terrible i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was <UNK> out of <UNK> minutes of my vacation not recommended by any stretch of the imagination
<START> this <UNK> kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard but all in all the movie is incredibly stupid with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost and has no idea why and neither does the viewer as other murders are committed he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found and this ghost still <UNK> him for some reason not only is the plot completely stupid the lady ghost is more funny than anything especially when she suddenly flies across the city like wonder woman and the ending makes little sense in fact the whole movie makes little sense and i can't recommend it at all if it didn't take itself so serious i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy outside of bright future this is the worst movie directed by <UNK> kurosawa i have seen yet
<START> well i don't think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be but there's no denying that it's got problems br br mostly the problems are in the script there's a plot but not much story and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible it <UNK> out any number of self <UNK> strange and or stereotypical characters lines moments what have you and by the end it just hasn't added up to much in this department br br sorry but i couldn't care less about whatever social ill farnsworth might be trying to address there will always be a <UNK> of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal <UNK> or whatever it is those morons do so as a film you won't find me calling <UNK> important but at a <UNK> level the picture is more than interesting and some of <UNK> choices in depicting a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out state are beautiful hilarious disturbing and yes i'm going to say it inspired br br the acting is uneven but that just may be a <UNK> of the <UNK> praised <UNK> reaching look <UNK> arquette is a fine actress but she's not very good here so a <UNK> audience member does have to ask what happened it's weird that diane foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near for example i might seriously consider whatever explanation farnsworth could provide for michael t <UNK> over the top turn as a <UNK> officer but i doubt i'd ever buy it it just doesn't work br br then again it's the most alive and in the moment that i've seen john savage appear in years so go figure br br this is the sort of work that <UNK> but does not promise and that's okay neither farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies so whether or not farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen but if he does it seems pretty likely that it won't be bland <UNK> in an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of american idol perhaps we could allow not <UNK> <UNK> legitimate and undeniably flawed film br br what is more perhaps we could welcome not <UNK> his energetic and sometimes <UNK> <UNK> imagination
<START> a visit by hitler in rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love friendship homosexuality and <UNK> sophia loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of hitler and <UNK> she has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid she would have loved to go though as she along with the entire <UNK> complex where she lives is an <UNK> admirer of <UNK> <UNK> br br there is one exception though across the yard sits <UNK> mastroianni on his chair <UNK> suicide the reason he is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio <UNK> the film really takes off when these two people meet by chance mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend loren frustrated by her own cheating husband <UNK> mastroianni and in a masterfully shot directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected the initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her <UNK> for this man this anti fascist this homosexual this other world who is so willing to give her all that she <UNK> for br br this is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed this is a simple but yet powerful film about <UNK> love ordinary people and most importantly the human condition despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement things will change someone has understood
<START> i expected a bad movie and got a bad movie but i couldn't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was i don't even want to try to explain what blood surf is about is not about blood surfing but a big a crocodile they are complaining about the fake shark in jaws but spielberg was wise and didn't show the shark until the end here the crocodile is shown a lot of times and it's the worst fake crocodile i have ever seen and they don't try to hide it if you want to see a good fake crocodile watch lake <UNK> br br the director had an opportunity to make a decent surf shark movie but he had to make a bad b monster movie he had the chance to make an original surf movie but he wanted to make a monster movie so you have understand how bad this movie is does it have some good parts not really it got some nudity and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie the acting isn't half bad either and kate <UNK> looks good too bad she doesn't take her top off the lead actors aren't bad either they had some potential the location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes the blame is on the <UNK> writer and director the dialogue is some of the worst i have ever seen and the script is really badly written and the director got no talent what so ever and not much of a fantasy either br br don't watch it even if you want to watch the beautiful kate <UNK> it isn't worth it watch <UNK> to watch kate nude and watch lake <UNK> if you want some good crocodile action br br 3 10 because i'm in a good mood and maureen <UNK> looks good naked and kate looks good but is bad actress and <UNK> miller joel west and matt <UNK> did a good job with the piece of sh t they had to work with
<START> spin it br br the 90s opened up with a clever disney favorite <UNK> the tv cartoon series that featured characters from the jungle book join <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as they fly the sea duck like you've never seen it before out of cape <UNK> to <UNK> up mountains through <UNK> on water in <UNK> looking for adventure looking for treasure looking for fun all in one action packed cartoon adventure br br this was a favorite of mine as well as my family's this ran on the disney afternoon the entire first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the old disney channel in 1995 which i have seen on vacation once in 1996 before getting cable in march 1997 br br and good news today the dvds are here <UNK> the fun and excitement of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br 10 10
<START> there are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe but are overshadowed with bad acting plot holes <UNK> ex <UNK> thrown ins stupid dialogs weak script and predictable clichés br br what we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere for most of the time a group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first yeah that cliché seems to be still very much alive even in <UNK> seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital there are <UNK> ghosts very imaginative zombies at one point i thought at least they didn't use zombies but they came and <UNK> <UNK> rock band with demonic make up on getting in their way there is also some time shift <UNK> present but it adds up nothing to the storyline <UNK> girl and a <UNK> seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation but they never spell it out to the viewer or their confused friends their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like what happens will happen or light can't live in the darkness or the ominous i need a red <UNK> red <UNK> so all this characters including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types end up doing is running around them dark floors and from or <UNK> to the demons occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up and if it seems a demon <UNK> can't spot a group of six people coming towards it waving a <UNK> and <UNK> it was just pretending and apparently this demon can break through walls without much <UNK> but opening elevator door is beyond its <UNK> br br in the end we even get a it was all a dream sequence twist or maybe it wasn't oh boy i wish this movie was and that kind that makes time seem to move faster so it all plays out in just 10 minutes or so
<START> this movie is excellent and i would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it or even better you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over i can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then but after watching it again yesterday i've found it to be amazing br br a good blend of comedy although not as great as mr <UNK> another one of my favorites and action this deserves 10 10 and i'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon fingers crossed if you do <UNK> or have to look after young children for anything then i'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours
<START> though not in the whole film andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tv movie the plot is easy <UNK> character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids <UNK> his <UNK> is the place he named mountains somewhere though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video if you do get the chance to watch this take it
<START> this documentary was interesting but it was also long so long it lasts a total of <UNK> minutes like ben <UNK> long but if your into that this is for you but only if you have a passion for movies like i do being that martin scorsese is my favorite director live and maybe even ever this is quite fascinating especially if you know the style of <UNK> works because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films not the best documentary film ever made but it is a leap for scorsese which is always good to watch a
<START> there is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where homer watches the attempt of december 6 1957 at least that was the video used on the tv he was watching which showed the <UNK> launch attempt which failed br br he is next shown reading or <UNK> a letter to dr von <UNK> offering <UNK> about the failure br br von <UNK> was at marshall space flight center in <UNK> working for the army the <UNK> project was by the early <UNK> team which was at what soon became <UNK> space flight center br br the army rushed the <UNK> c which was essentially a us made <UNK> technology but worked to launch a satellite in response to <UNK> success with <UNK> br br this error may have actually been made by homer because of the <UNK> of von <UNK> but his team didn't have their attempt fail in fact the underlying <UNK> was flying from <UNK> and was the first us man rated <UNK> used for <UNK> sub <UNK> flight as well as <UNK> br br this is why this sort of movie is so good as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia and in the process see what has been done and be inspired to do more
<START> a film without conscience drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money then they double cross him meanwhile he falls in love with the dead man's wife and without her knowing he's the killer moves in with her then he accidentally kills her when she finds out then in a walking tall kind of <UNK> he gets revenge on the <UNK> who double crossed him the first problem is that by <UNK> to take on the murder by hire assignment the drifter loses all sense of sympathy <UNK> and <UNK> we can't accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center we just can't care about that kind of guy and the wife nicely played by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the sheriff in eight <UNK> freaks a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter despite her evidently <UNK> state after the death of her husband and when she finds out he's the guy  what does she do she locks him inside her house as if all houses had locks you can't open from inside with her and proceeds to <UNK> him <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> however is terrific in a role as a <UNK> thug director stuart gordon did so much better with re animator and <UNK>
<START> i'm a fan of arty movies but <UNK> i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel <UNK> slow to develop a non existent plot based on a promising premise the experience is shall we say trying even after bad movies i feel that i learn something or enjoyed some aspect but there there was nothing to appreciate the premise was not uninteresting but the movie starts and ends there the acting was ok though the characters were utterly boring for the protagonist to aim at such an <UNK> goal she is <UNK> empty pity i usually enjoy movies that are <UNK> but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content
<START> over powered mobile suits that can <UNK> entire <UNK> check weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still <UNK> everything check mobile suits based on angels check br br ok its a gundam series this one gundam wing has good character development real world complexity interesting ideas and some pretty eye candy br br with characters the initially weak <UNK> <UNK> later <UNK> then back to <UNK> gets stronger and more independent although is still absolutely <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> the series main character the aforementioned <UNK> initially a cold hard <UNK> becomes more and more human while still remaining in character and seeing the lost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> between oz <UNK> and command of white <UNK> shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations br br the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good <UNK> how the real world works however in <UNK> half hour episodes it does become a bit of a <UNK> in that this complexity isn't used to its full potential br br the ideas at the core of the series the necessity of fighting the desire for peace etc are ones that <UNK> even today in retrospect the series was ahead of its time what with the war on terrorism and all but its exploration of these ideas the monologues especially those of <UNK> <UNK> is an incredible dramatic piece <UNK> some of the best writing in the series br br but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge br br in terms of eye candy which is what this one has in <UNK> everything from the mobile suits to the <UNK> <UNK> no not the <UNK> you idiot is wells designed and explodes in big balls of orange which is bad because better animation would've had better explosions but who cares stuff explodes and thats all that matters br br in short though the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes you've missed out on a lot the poor writing can leave you cringing and sometimes the animation makes you go wtf but this is made up for in its classic animation style its scale sparks of incredible dialogue and its more mature exploration that one expects of such <UNK> animations
<START> this is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it i wouldn't say that it is very scary but more fun i guess that is if you like horror movies scarecrow kind of remembered me of children of the corn but still not if you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch
<START> life stinks 1991 was a step below mel brooks other productions he stars as a rich man who <UNK> an insane <UNK> with his friends brooks claims that he can life like a homeless man for a month his shocked and amused friends accept this unusual <UNK> during his stay in the <UNK> he meets a bunch of odd homeless people one of them catches his fancy <UNK> ann warren they strike up a friendship as she teaches him the many tricks she learned whilst living on the street can mr brooks survive on his own without the <UNK> of being filthy rich will he win this <UNK> <UNK> who are his true friends find out when you watch life stinks to find out br br this film has been <UNK> unfairly sure it's not a classic like his earlier films but it's still enjoyable i liked the way mel brooks pays homage to charles chaplin in this film if you have watched <UNK> earlier silent films then you'll get the humor as well br br recommended for mel brooks fans
<START> i loved this show growing up and i still watch the first season dvd at age 19 today what can i say i grew up in a house much like the one on full house i had a dad two sisters and a dog i guess the only difference was that i did not live with my uncle and my <UNK> best friend also i grew up with my mom in the house i don't know what i would have done without full house on television i think that stephanie played by jodie <UNK> d j played by kirk <UNK> sister <UNK> and michelle played by mary kate and ashley olsen are my favorite characters i can relate to each of them because i am the middle child of my family like <UNK> i am a younger sister like michelle and i am an older sister like d j i really like how the show always has moral values because i don't really like any of the o c like shows today i like the comedy of full house too uncle jesse john <UNK> joey dave <UNK> and danny bob <UNK> are hilarious as the girls' uncle <UNK> friend and dad respectively the story goes that after the girls' mom dies <UNK> best friend joey and his brother in law jesse move in to help raise the kids three men trying to raise three young girls hilarious each character on full house is full of heart funny and genuinely believable joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid's heart and soul jesse is the cool motorcycle riding tough guy uncle who is <UNK> by his three <UNK> and later his wife <UNK> laurie <UNK> from <UNK> both kids and adults will love this show guaranteed
<START> vaguely reminiscent of great 1940's westerns like the treasure of the <UNK> <UNK> 1948 red rock west is a story about conscience greed and betrayal michael nicolas cage is a down and out but honest young man from texas who goes west in search of work and money he finds both but not in the way he had expected br br the film's screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists excellent cinematography <UNK> film editing and moody western music add tension and suspense the <UNK> of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting and the acting <UNK> from good to excellent with great performances from dennis hopper and j t walsh dwight <UNK> specially recorded country western song provides the film with a strong finale br br correctly labeled as neo noir red rock west strikes me as being something else as well the plot is full of amazing <UNK> and improbable timing so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed <UNK> i would agree in this case however when combined with the moody atmosphere and the fact that the small town of red rock seems almost empty of normal daily life the <UNK> and unlikely timing suggest a story that beyond <UNK> is surreal it's almost as if fate deliberately <UNK> with improbable events so as to force michael to come to grips with himself from this point of view the <UNK> are not script flaws at all they are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons disguised as other characters br br all we need here is rod <UNK> in a <UNK> explaining in his always clearly <UNK> voice that a young man searching for himself stops in a small almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere it's his final <UNK> in a journey to the twilight zone
<START> simple story why say more it nails it's premise world war 3 kills all or most of the human race and we're viewing 2 of the survivors the message is that the 2 <UNK> sides should not have been at odds in the first place <UNK> down to <UNK> from each side we see they have everything to come together for br br security finding resources food shelter etc survival love br br at the end they've decided to pool their resources she finally does so they will survive simple story expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape we see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable in the early 60s no one had seen such stuff i give it a 10
<START> page 3 is a great movie the story is so refreshing and interesting not once throughout the movie did i find myself staring off into space <UNK> <UNK> did a good job in the movie although i think someone with more <UNK> or enthusiasm would have been better but she did do a great job all the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along <UNK> <UNK> did a great job there is one thing that stands out in this movie the story it is great and very realistic it doesn't beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message i think more movie like this should be made i am sick of watching the same candy <UNK> movies over and over they are getting hard to <UNK> now everyone should watch page 3 it is a great film just my 2 cents
<START> maybe i identify with this film cause i live in nyc and suffer from bad insomnia but whatever it is i must praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job to do what she did with no budget wow thats all i can say really really good like no money was spent on this film and it still blew me away i <UNK> suggest checking it out if you can great directing fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your <UNK> see it
<START> this movie brought tears to my eyes john roberts really knew how to get to <UNK> hearts directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of paulie we discover from time to time with the help of sensitive and talented directors like john that even small creatures like paulie have a heart i just couldn't stop my tears even though the film has a happy end this is great after thousands of films i saw through my life paulie really touched me deeply this is after the ugly <UNK> the second picture that really turned me upside down
<START> <UNK> as a film goes through the usual clichés man and woman fall in love and marry husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune woman <UNK> and surprise surprise husband no 1 <UNK> the movie is reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and countless others <UNK> <UNK> and shah rukh khan give good performances <UNK> <UNK> as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain the music by <UNK> <UNK> is superb all the songs were brilliant my favourites are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions
<START> it must have been several years after it was released so don't know why it was at the movies but as a kid i enjoyed it i just found a vhs tape of superman and the mole men at the flea market and decided to watch it again it's been a lot of years i wasn't expecting much now knowing how the b movies were made at that time but i was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired surprisingly the writing wasn't bad either forget the fact that superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their <UNK> in the beginning because then the story would have ended right ok the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary they didn't even scare me as a kid however making <UNK> for the <UNK> low budget for background and costumes it was a job well done by all i recognized the sheriff right away as the old ranger from death valley days and plenty of supporting roles in tv westerns j farrell macdonald played old pop and was always a great supporting actor in more movies than i can count walter reed and jeff corey were familiar faces as well from other movies did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get king kong did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as <UNK> <UNK> in old <UNK> some of the mole men were famous too jerry <UNK> has played mayor <UNK> for <UNK> little oscar <UNK> was the <UNK> that handed dorothy the <UNK> was on a <UNK> episode and a wealth of other work billy curtis played an unforgettable part with clint eastwood in high <UNK> drifter was one of the friends met by the star in incredible <UNK> man he had a part in a movie i just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled my gal <UNK> with rita hayworth wizard of oz and plenty of other parts great actor john <UNK> was also a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who played lois lane in this movie was without question wonderful in the part and george reeves as superman clark kent was superman he did a great job of playing the strong man bottom line to all i've said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie but it was the 50's and anything was possible from <UNK> from outer space to mole men from inner space it is definitely worth seeing there isn't a bad actor in the group <UNK> put the cast together was very very fortunate to get so many gifted actors into a b type film some already had a wealth of experience and some were about to obtain a wealth of experience but all were gifted so if you get a chance to see the film forget the dopey costumes and just enjoy the excitement and acting is it a bird is it a plane no just a good old fashioned movie to enjoy
<START> this is a mildly interesting late 80's gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood if you can get past the <UNK> of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this the acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks but the movie isn't a complete waste of time the special effects are actually quite good and the gore is well done it reminded me of the remake of the blob probably because of the <UNK> of it all all in all you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time but i wouldn't suggest seeing this movie unless you've got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing
<START> this film has over the past ten years become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences the three storyline threads given us by kazan each have their unique and separate pleasures the domestic <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> and widmark the movement between rooms the small gestures such as the phone book barbara places on the chair under her son so he can reach the table those small intimate <UNK> between husband and wife all are well crafted and natural more than anything else i love their <UNK> that second living room where it is clear they spend much of their summer time the second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film but especially between widmark and <UNK> characters it may not be totally original and does get a bit <UNK> but all in all it comes across as real <UNK> and efficient the third thread the <UNK> tale of <UNK> and his <UNK> little gang gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world <UNK> <UNK> is as cold as a block of ice this self <UNK> business man this self made man clearly has a complexity we only briefly tap in to for me this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience
<START> im a huge m <UNK> fan that's why i ended up watching this movie honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming it's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i rated this movie 7 10 br br the suspense of wondering what <UNK> was actually up to was what really <UNK> me interested in this movie br br its a good rental br br 7 10
<START> i can not believe such <UNK> <UNK> material is getting passed off to americans as art house material early on from such telling lines like we want to make sure they are playing for the right team and manipulative framing and lighting a love divided shows it's true face the crass manner in which the irish <UNK> are shown as <UNK> the <UNK> as peaceful and <UNK> is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between <UNK> and american indians the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright <UNK> of the irish <UNK> in the story a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral <UNK> by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent so far from attempting art this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library
<START> this film is pure <UNK> <UNK> boredom i knew nothing of it before i entered the dark room took my seat i was <UNK> by the mysterious and suspenseful <UNK> on the poster i suppose also lena <UNK> is nice and <UNK> sexy and richard <UNK> is always a reliable guy to have around so the cast seemed reasonable it may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on i should've gone to see <UNK> for the second time instead br br the thin plot revolves around <UNK> gina <UNK> her boyfriend her father her sister and her sister's husband who for some reason are being stalked in a very <UNK> and <UNK> manner by their evil <UNK> who emerge from mirrors that mysteriously smash there could be a great film behind this idea not exactly an original idea mind you but still and in fact if the filmmakers had <UNK> away all the supporting cast and simply stuck to <UNK> character's story the broken could've made a reasonable 20 minute short as it is it is desperately <UNK> and boring and terribly inconsistent br br for instance in one scene a mirror <UNK> on its own in a room <UNK> all the main characters they look puzzled but quickly forget about it in another scene a mirror <UNK> in an empty room and a <UNK> is visible as she steps out of the <UNK> left hanging on the wall so why did the first mirror smash if no creepy <UNK> was to come <UNK> out just for a little thrill there are far too many scenes of the characters in the <UNK> lit london <UNK> <UNK> around <UNK> <UNK> they thought they heard something but seeing nothing there and moving on we begin to wonder why doesn't this <UNK> <UNK> actually ever want to try to scare them scare the characters and you have a chance of <UNK> the audience but we the audience will need to start threatening each other in the darkness of the theater if we want to have any thrills during the broken by the way once we've spent time with these evil <UNK> we are totally <UNK> as to why anyone should be expected to be frightened of them they just stand around blank looks on their faces perhaps totally harmless after killing their others br br there are some nice <UNK> and touches throughout and i dare say director sean <UNK> could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if he was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time
<START> new york i love you or rather should be titled manhattan i love looking at your people in sometimes love is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation case in point look at two of the segments in the film one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy talk and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an <UNK> demand from his director to read two <UNK> books while the latter isn't a great story by any stretch it's at least something that has a beginning middle and end as the composer tries to score gets <UNK> dumped in his lap and in the end gets some help and maybe something more from a girl he's been talking to as a <UNK> between him and the director the ethan hawke scene however is like nothing and feels like it like a <UNK> added in or directed by a filmmaker <UNK> it in or for that matter hawke with a <UNK> of before sunrise and reality bites br br what's <UNK> about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible <UNK> and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or <UNK> with one another i e bits involving <UNK> cooper <UNK> <UNK> hayden christensen andy garcia james <UNK> natalie portman etc it's not even so much that the film set practically always in manhattan and not the new york of queens or <UNK> island or the <UNK> not even say harlem or washington heights lacks a good deal of diversity since there is some it's the lack of imagination that one found in <UNK> for better or worse in paris <UNK> it's mostly got little to do with new york except for passing references and at its worst the julie christie <UNK> <UNK> segment it's incomprehensible on a level that is appalling br br so basically wait for tv and do your best to <UNK> in and out of the film in that is for three scenes the aforementioned bloom christina <UNK> segment which is charming the brett <UNK> directed segment yes x men 3 brett <UNK> with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist and eli <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their <UNK> wedding <UNK> everything else can be missed even natalie <UNK> directorial debut and the return of a hughes brother only one allan to the screen a mixed bag is putting it lightly it's like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy <UNK> to find the few <UNK> left
<START> wow i loved this movie it is about normal life in a small village about <UNK> and honesty love and surrender great it is about things everybody encounters in life you have to do things with passion but some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you there are people who find the opinion of others and <UNK> will the neighbors <UNK> more important than to follow their heart don't let <UNK> opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion i loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people it could have been my family no big <UNK> but all people you fall in love with during the movie
<START> stephen king adaptation scripted by king himself in which a young family <UNK> to rural <UNK> find out about the pet cemetery close to their home the father <UNK> <UNK> then finds out about the <UNK> burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of <UNK> only of course anything buried there comes back not quite right br br below average horror picture starts out clumsy insulting and inept and continues that way for a while with the absolute worst element being <UNK> worthless performance it gets a little better toward the end with genuinely disturbing finale in point of fact the whole movie is really disturbing which is why i can't completely dismiss it at least it has something to make it memorable decent supporting performances by fred <UNK> as the wise old aged neighbor and brad <UNK> as the <UNK> spirit victor <UNK> are not enough to really redeem film br br king has his usual cameo as the minister br br followed by a sequel also directed by mary <UNK> is it any wonder that she's had no mainstream film work since br br 4 10
<START> there are movies that are awful and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long forgotten and unwatchable also lots of violence and bad stuff not just cheesy stuff you know what i mean add to the mix as well what is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content why final justice of course br br remember mitchell joe don baker was the star of that movie and that was <UNK> by joel and the <UNK> on mystery science theater 3000 now this time with mike taking <UNK> place on the satellite of love but with the same <UNK> that trio got to make fun of <UNK> second joe don baker movie final justice of course much of the naughty stuff that i mentioned was removed for television release but still i want to watch that episode and mitchell as well because what does joe don hate the most why none other than mystery science theater 3000 br br p s if you have a big lots nearby check that store for the uncut tape lol that happened to another user
<START> <UNK> excellent nice camera angles i don't remember seeing a movie of late with good close ups until this one could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera ny is <UNK> good i liked the upside down angles in particular a different touch br br music not impressive songs don't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie may be i expected same quality like <UNK> a disappointment br br actors kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard core action sequences his age and belly really show up also he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward it was a very awkward to see a mature aged star still trying to play like a 20 heroes scenes love can be expressed at any age as we get older you still can express love nicely from a distance without touching a woman too much for example the love expressed by <UNK> in <UNK> br br <UNK> just appears for the <UNK> in the movie not sure why she accepted this well that is not my problem i guess br br others just have a small presence br br direction i expected <UNK> to <UNK> or measure up to his other movie <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> me it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues he slips in few scenes even <UNK> things got slipped from a famous director br br overall just a okay movie too much graphics definitely not for kids and adults who expect some kind of entertainment br br <UNK>
<START> with a title like that it's above and beyond my <UNK> how this movie just did not appeal to me granted there's a few <UNK> sleazy moments and a little gore but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at <UNK> shock tactics the inconsistent plot starts with a guy <UNK> and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road he and his <UNK> brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and <UNK> to meet his girlfriend out in the woods he ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement the heavily drugged <UNK> consist of her old boyfriend who raped her a <UNK> neighbor and her sexually <UNK> boss he explains to her that he is going to kill them all she winds up killing him and then turning her focus towards the men or pigs whom she <UNK> and kills herself most of the violence and <UNK> has to do with sh t eating and <UNK> destroying all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild the best scene is a graphic <UNK> handle masturbation followed by some painful man rape surely i spit on your corpse i p ss on your grave was intended as an <UNK> sequel to i spit on your grave based on mainly the title and a reference the main character gives suggesting her mother was <UNK> keaton i personally consider that to be a wildly <UNK> <UNK> this movie is a boring amateurish mess that <UNK> for shocks but failed miserably
<START> i have to admit to enjoying bad movies i love them i watch all of them horror especially my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work rent some crazy tapes order a pizza and have a blast this one had a great box so i was expecting less than usual br br the story is about a <UNK> project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above ground layers <UNK> and the other underground layers are simply covered up the inhabitants of this <UNK> find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave this wakes up some zombies br br from this point on it's <UNK> city the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll br br ok it's not great art but this one with its in joke dialogue and over the top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening actually it was one of the best party tapes i have ever had the pleasure of watching and you could tell it was done on no money with a bunch of crazy people there are hundreds of zombies and the director looks like brendan <UNK> he has a cameo and it is just a wild trip
<START> splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix mystery thriller musical briefly we are allowed to tell about the story a girl comes into a european <UNK> and then soft <UNK> from nonsense mystery to narrative logic in a no time no place way <UNK> managed a delight in b w by means of imagination and despite thanks to the <UNK> of budgets br br because of the <UNK> of time space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem almost a <UNK> spain land of quick poetry in b w <UNK> the early <UNK> br br a must see for <UNK> our belief in young cinema outside the states
<START> this movie has problems in its presentation may even be offensive to people who are looking for <UNK> and cultural <UNK> but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues one of these is the nature and character of the relationship between jesus and <UNK> another is that of the historical nature of the bible and faith and third is the humanity of jesus the tension of the christ <UNK> relationship is developed and held through the movie <UNK> passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of christ when <UNK> takes his own life the viewer can sense the angst <UNK> denial and guilt however moving are not as <UNK> portrayed as the <UNK> drama chris sarandon offers a novel and provocative christ whether believable or not i would like to find this movie on dvd or even vhs to use in study or discussion groups
<START> star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways first it's a fan made series available only on the web and it features mainly friends neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and <UNK> machines to as mickey judy once put it put on a show it's definitely friends neighbors to you can tell a lot of these people aren't the most beautiful looking folks you've ever seen or the youngest or the <UNK> some of them stumble through their lines like they're walking on <UNK> some of them have thick accents or simply don't seem to speak well in the first place <UNK> makes it virtually impossible to understand a single <UNK> word that they're saying still you have to admit for everything these friends neighbors have put together it's actually fun to watch yes some of the dialogue is hokey yes it's a little odd though admittedly a little cool too watching two <UNK> males kiss although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on yes you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from st <UNK> <UNK> other shows and the movies or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show okay we can get by that why the graphics are first rate better than almost anything you've seen and sometimes a show or two really stands out story <UNK> some of them are actually real tear <UNK> br br hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the <UNK> but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this <UNK> people sets costumes <UNK> it's a huge effort on a lot of people's parts we watch we return and we thank them

<START> one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex <UNK> story is very familiar to people in ex <UNK> because generation after war used to live in the same way people in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people the plot is in the 50 when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> said no to the <UNK> and <UNK> and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence but in a country were people didn't had much money <UNK> was only ideal and friendship was everything the friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their <UNK> from <UNK> is still alive they get together after all this years on <UNK> s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood before their went to the <UNK> and become successful people
<START> i must have seen this a dozen times over the years i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b w on the local <UNK> station br br i bought a dvd set for the children to see and am making them watch it they don't teach history in school and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century it <UNK> their critical thinking br br <UNK> with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why it details what lead up to the war and the actual war br br buy it for your children along with <UNK> <UNK> america watch it with them and make them understand you'll be so glad you did
<START> they did it and boy did they do it fantastically or what the bbc finally brought the doctor back to our screens on a saturday evening where he belongs and they did it with style br br episode one rose one of the strengths of the new series is <UNK> t davies as a writer and executive producer he's a fan of the show and knows what the other fans want but also is an experienced writer in his own right so knows what other people want another strength as perfectly shown here in this first episode is <UNK> <UNK> and her character of rose tyler finally the doctor's companion gets a credible back story and a strong character also nice to see the return of the <UNK> a nice nod to the classic series there br br episode two the end of the world in the start of this double bill to show off the <UNK> strengths we end up in a story where special effects is everything they now have the technology to create real believable <UNK> and monsters no more rubber suits of sorts also the hints at the end of this episode regarding the new doctor's past very intriguing to kill off all the time <UNK> and make him the only one br br episode three the <UNK> dead we've had the future now lets have the past the first non davies written episode is a little flat in some places but this is made up for by simon <UNK> charles dickens and the sudden twist in the plot when it is revealed the pitiful <UNK> are not so pitiful after all br br episode four aliens of london the consequences of the doctor's actions are fully explored in this series not least with the <UNK> of rose running off with him also we have our first cliffhanger not the best of ones admittedly the <UNK> are an interesting villain though they can look too cgi for their own good br br episode five world war three the second part of this story about the <UNK> suffers mainly from the same problems of the first also the clips from the next episode coming up at the end of the current episode are annoying and spoil it for people br br episode six <UNK> yes we've had the future the past and the present ish but now we get to the good stuff the return of the doctor's arch nemesis here i think we can <UNK> christopher <UNK> he was brilliant as the doctor and no more so then in this episode where we see the pain on his face as he <UNK> the time war and the alien nature of him as he almost turns into a <UNK> himself br br episode seven the long game really only a story to act as a prologue for the series finale saved by simon pegg as the smarmy editor and <UNK> <UNK> in an amusing cameo the media are controlling us that's never been done before has it br br episode eight father's day this is a great episode full of human emotion and <UNK> for rose and the true consequences of what happens when you really <UNK> up history full marks to <UNK> <UNK> here br br episode nine the empty child i don't find this kid very scary sorry but i don't it's a good episode though but the cliffhanger still could have been better it's those next time bits that spoil them john <UNK> is introduced here as captain jack the dashing <UNK> he's a good actor who's been around for a while but only seemingly noticed now br br episode ten the doctor dances part two of this ww2 story very well made in historical context terms a nice upbeat ending though a little confusing perhaps for younger viewers when the mummy is revealed br br episode eleven boom town probably the weakest of the series but that doesn't mean its bad a nice return for the <UNK> and also an interesting character study of the doctor and rose br br episode twelve bad wolf this starts off quite silly with some good hearted humour and <UNK> fun making at popular tv shows over her in <UNK> things turn deadly serious quickly though and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series br br episode <UNK> <UNK> of the ways goodbye christopher <UNK> a fantastic doctor in so many ways david <UNK> is having to really work his <UNK> off to be as good as him the <UNK> scene at the end is beautifully played oh and the <UNK> are back in the extreme god bless cgi because they'd never be able to pull this off normally br br overall brilliant 9 10
<START> the lady from shanghai is well known as one of hollywood's most troubled productions welles' original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to <UNK> this made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of they post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the <UNK> of the irish accent and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done most disastrous of all welles and his on screen and real life leading lady rita hayworth were falling apart in their relationship and their <UNK> chemistry comes through on screen br br fortunately this is all overcome by just how fantastic orson welles' direction is he makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric every scene just seems to be breathing down your back from the screen also the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on <UNK> and surreal this sense of weirdness <UNK> scenes that are often found in these films such as the courtroom sequences in the middle i typically find courtroom dramas a bore but welles' direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else the ending at the carnival reminds one of david lynch almost br br the acting here is also very good despite their failing relationship welles and hayworth both give decent performances their interactions however are just a bit lacking everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though especially everett sloane and glenn <UNK> the lady from shanghai obviously has its problems but its worth watching just to see one of <UNK> masters at his finest 8 10
<START> as someone who was <UNK> at the incredible visuals of hero i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines but better it also featured an actress i like <UNK> zhang well i was disappointed on both counts i bought the dvd of this film sight unseen and that was a mistake it was not better br br i realize these flying through the air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief a blind woman <UNK> hundreds of opponents sorry that's going a little far also the major male character <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was so annoying with his dialog stupid look on his face and stupid laugh that he ruined the film too br br despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes this story to me just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth <UNK> this film is no hero of mine
<START> i really enjoyed this movie it succeeded in doing something that few movies do now it provided family values while entertaining me nancy drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to the little girls i was with <UNK> enjoyed the movie and kept talking about nancy as we walked out of the theater the movie has relatively few problems for families and i don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater no it won't win an oscar and it did not showcase magnificent special effects or even provide a horribly spooky mystery but it entertained me and it stood true to the the spirit of the books i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody with a young girl she will love it or any fan of the books you will not be disappointed
<START> van <UNK> must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this <UNK> poor film as indeed must every single individual involved to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish production values are somewhere between the original series of <UNK> and <UNK> cell block <UNK> most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot as for the acting performances if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable <UNK> to explain how some <UNK> old <UNK> blonde <UNK> has come to be getting spit <UNK> by a couple of <UNK> with <UNK> you will have some idea of the standard of acting in <UNK> <UNK> worse still you can't even fast forward to the sex scenes because there aren't any an <UNK> dreadful film
<START> my friends and i rented this from blockbuster because we saw <UNK> <UNK> name on the box this movie is a travesty i hope she <UNK> from her <UNK> br br the plot was lose and <UNK> the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts the movie made no sense whatsoever the rough plot of an alien <UNK> species that <UNK> humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this for example invasion of the body <UNK> and the <UNK> br br if you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie i suggest you burn it br br how it classes itself as a horror movie when there was no use of fear suspense gore terror or any of the usual horror film techniques i don't know however if you still find yourself wanting to watch this film i suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand so you can find parts of it funny
<START> as i drove from <UNK> <UNK> to dawson city <UNK> a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and <UNK> views would have been shot in the actual location <UNK> in the canadian <UNK> is a magnificent place but still not the real place where the film takes place when the story moves to dawson that is when i feel anthony mann who used the <UNK> locations so well could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps <UNK> <UNK> is the nice girl mann is excellent directing the <UNK> but the high point of the film is how well he does in the <UNK> scenes he uses the <UNK> as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery the <UNK> white like it was with the <UNK> in the naked <UNK> and the <UNK> in the man from <UNK> like all of the mann <UNK> this is a traditional western with a difference in the <UNK> of stewart's character which is more complex
<START> my sincere advice to all don't watch the movie br br don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes it's 3 30 am in the morning and i returned from this <UNK> movie on this universe four hours damn i am proud that i survived after all of it if this is called survival br br i am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night rubbish movie br br happy republic day to one and all
<START> director otto preminger <UNK> with his laura stars dana andrews and gene tierney in this rough and ready to <UNK> film noir where the sidewalk ends this film is complete with a well written crime story with interesting characters unexpected turns and clever dialogue and an eye pleasing look with great camera movements and dark and gritty film noir lighting dana andrews stars as detective mark dixon part mobster and part cop who has a reputation of being too physically tough with criminals after one case sees dixon in search of suspects and answers he gets far more involved than he wanted br br dana andrews is terrific in his role tough and edgy <UNK> dixon is ready to knock any and all off their heels if they get on his bad side he's the perfect film noir anti hero he's not very nice all the time but we still root for him gene tierney does a solid job in her role as much as it is being a sweet shoulder for dixon there might not be too much to <UNK> role but she certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role knocking every member of the audience out with her kind smile gentle manner and <UNK> in her eye the supporting cast isn't too bad either karl malden being the most memorable stepping in and giving a good supporting performance as lieutenant thomas where the sidewalk ends is no laura but it is a great film noir filled with great characters story and picture
<START> where was his critique of <UNK> <UNK> as well as <UNK> ones after all he did serve for 17 years in a body of government where his influence was <UNK> oh i forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most powerful nation on earth the film is happy to show shots of a young senator gore asking why a <UNK> scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper but fails to ask about the <UNK> of <UNK> gore in global warming probably too close to an election year or maybe it would hurt the chances for <UNK> in <UNK> either way he's a political coward and party man to the bitter end he offers no criticism of <UNK> no criticism of capitalism no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time br br in the end this film was much more about mr gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces mr gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film <UNK> it call it what it really is
<START> perhaps we can <UNK> a meet where are you now i'm sitting in my office i doubt that why would you doubt that if you were in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face to face br br bourne remains street tough and <UNK> only his <UNK> <UNK> leads the film a little too far into fantasy conversation is macho to the point with only <UNK> of bond type <UNK> humour its all about the action br br the feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy <UNK> so well a scene set in <UNK> with a guardian journalist does this to great effect there is no meeting of worlds you are in it or just a superfluous body br br if the shaky <UNK> doesn't annoy you too much enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going
<START> blonde and <UNK> was unfunny basically it was a rip off girl version of dumb and dumber but less funny and they used too much background noises and music way too much background noises and music if you ask me it starts out immensely boring and totally inane it doesn't pick up pace anywhere soon and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on maybe the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes i found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it <UNK> the end but that was the only part also i couldn't help but like pamela anderson and denise <UNK> characters a little even though this movie didn't get any laughs from me it kept my attention i wouldn't say to completely avoid this movie but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and <UNK>
<START> this sweeping drama has it all top notch acting incredible photography good story it is often compared to braveheart because both movies take place in historical scotland even though i love braveheart i think this is the better of the two films jessica lange gave an incredible performance should have been nominated for an oscar liam neeson is fantastic in the title role tim roth plays one of the most evil despicable characters in film history he was nominated for an oscar john hurt is excellent as lord <UNK> another <UNK> character i am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play this is a story of a <UNK> over money between rob roy and his clan and lord <UNK> rob roy is a self made man who will not solve his problems with <UNK> if it <UNK> his sense of honor <UNK> who inherited his title has no sense of honor and that is basically what this story is all about honor of the common man versus corruption of the <UNK> this movie is very entertaining it should appeal to all it has romance action beautiful scenery and has a exciting plot one of my favorite films
<START> yes this a b grade horror but at least the producers directors and cast does not pretend this flick is <UNK> from heaven the plot is corny a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is <UNK> with genetic acid turning him into a snow man the snowman a k a jack frost then goes on a murdering rampage to find the small town sheriff that finally arrested him with a limited budget the crew had to make do with limited special effects most of the money appears to spent on the <UNK> costume <UNK> difficult shots are managed by cartoons or pan away shots shots where the camera moves away to disguise the details br br this is no kid's movie and should not be confused with disney movie of the same title if you do not let your children watch pg 13 movies alone than parents should not let their kids watch this movie this movie has two claims to fame 1 the <UNK> shannon elizabeth american pie did her first major movie role the scene where jack frost attacks shannon elizabeth is worth watching a few times 2 this movie has the worst snowman joke ever the joke is so bad that the directors credit the joke <UNK> in the credit list
<START> whipped is one of the most awful films of all time it is a mean hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000 besides maybe the grinch it is not as people have called it an insightful portrait of modern relationships that would be a little film called high <UNK> whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic whipped is hostile cynical <UNK> cinematic poison avoid this like so many <UNK> unless you want to see how truly bad a comedy can get
<START> anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation this movie is a painful <UNK> the acting is stiff the stock generic soundtrack is laughable the direction is bland and strangest of all the teacher really isn't all that attractive making the <UNK> blatant advances all the more awkward the creative minds behind this trash should <UNK> and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated <UNK> i'm certain that some starving kids in africa could have used the money <UNK> on this project hell the <UNK> would have also seen a more <UNK> purpose <UNK> a crack addict at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it for the sole reason that it didn't give me a <UNK> illness i'll give this film a two
<START> along with south pacific guys and dolls is for grown ups it is sassy sexy and full of men being men and women being strung along br br there is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack the strength of jean <UNK> performance and the charm of a young brando and an already masterful sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piece br br guys and dolls wins as it is <UNK> what it is an mgm musical br br still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers it will remain one of the classics of 20th century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come br br <UNK> recommended
<START> i rented this movie from the library it's hard to find for good reason purely out of curiosity i'm a huge <UNK> fan and this movie was a complete disappointment the bell jar 1979 is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen the script is horrible not because it <UNK> from the original novel text but because it <UNK> without focus or intent the scenes are ill constructed and don't lead the viewer anywhere what's with the hokey voice over of <UNK> poetry lady <UNK> has little do with <UNK> situation <UNK> poetry was completely <UNK> marilyn <UNK> is completely unbelievable as esther <UNK> or any 20 year old for that matter partly due to casting she was <UNK> during filming the age <UNK> was when she died and partly due to the fact that she can't act <UNK> is all emotion no craft no skill the direction is mediocre the director simply covers what's there which isn't much the only reason i'm giving the film a 1 is because 0 isn't an option sorry sylvia you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting
<START> i love this movie it's wacky funny violent surreal played out in a <UNK> head and definitely not your usual comedy br br if you don't find the film amusing then i guess it's just not for your tastes so this is a tough one to write a review for br br for reference some other comedies i love are the big <UNK> the princess bride and <UNK> that one only got me the second time around there are others but my taste is definitely for the unusual and i am willing to accept that most people just don't tend to like that kind of thing i make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour at least i have one br br the scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together the verbal humour is hilarious the situations are intriguing the acting is very good as you would expect of the cast though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high the overall package makes for fun funny watchable yet violent entertainment
<START> inspired at least a little by <UNK> benson her all girls orchestra who performed throughout the war years at the <UNK> garden opera house this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly <UNK> player to <UNK> the almost all girl band with whom she played as a <UNK> towards the end of wwii all too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music and help to fill in the background to the band members and in particular to the girls' relationships with the lone male member their <UNK> drummer who is trying to dodge the call up br br ian <UNK> lord of the rings <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed elizabeth and the conniving <UNK> patrick the drummer the late joan <UNK> is perfect as the <UNK> leader now playing bar piano at the sea side and june <UNK> <UNK> as the salvation army <UNK> player cameo appearances by other <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> leslie caron olympia dukakis and <UNK> <UNK> make this an unforgettable experience the movie is a romp down memory lane with an all star cast of what ought by all rights to be a bunch of over the hill actresses all i can say is i hope i look as good at their age leslie caron in particular is still an incredible fox at <UNK> years of age she certainly still gets my pulse going as i watched it i was mentally <UNK> the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age afterwards i looked these girls up and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the london of 1944 although this might be a bit of a stretch for <UNK> <UNK> br br if you like swing bands <UNK> on nostalgia or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her don't miss this film br br
<START> as i mentioned previously john carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by the other being the classic conan the barbarian it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers whom i eventually <UNK> imaginary friend to keep him from killing me in my sleep now that is terror for a 10 year old br br it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works perhaps not in the <UNK> reaction but more of a <UNK> possibility or immediate <UNK> this all could happen it isn't in the realm of <UNK> or located in a foreign country as most modern horror is i e hostel <UNK> cry wolf saw etc at times it is graphic while the rest is <UNK> to our <UNK> i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least <UNK> of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head it still works because we can substitute implied or <UNK> killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create so we ourselves are <UNK> to our own fears and anxiety br br carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday middle class suburban and relatively <UNK> child who <UNK> on halloween and kills his sister he then spends the next 15 years in an institution which we thankfully do not experience only to escape and return to his hometown the infamous <UNK> on his way he kills and kills the child's name is michael meyers though he is not a person john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class <UNK> in the <UNK> of american safety and security chaos can still strike br br michael <UNK> to be a person once he killed he is not a serial killer human being or psychopath he is as <UNK> force the generic <UNK> <UNK> white shatner mask and lack of any dialog other then some breathing helps to <UNK> and complete michael's <UNK> this is the source of all his power he is <UNK> speechless and <UNK> in any way other than as a source of <UNK> chaos this is helped by the cinematography post card effect a lack of information motivation explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald <UNK> dr <UNK> his over the top performance and <UNK> sells the shape this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie <UNK> the innocent girl who <UNK> chaos in the face of overwhelming odds at least for a little bit br br though this isn't the first movie of this new <UNK> of horror films black christmas came out 4 years earlier it is the most successful and does not <UNK> upon reviewing if you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time like me this will probably make the <UNK> on the back of your head <UNK> at the first <UNK> of the signature soundtrack i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the <UNK> of john carpenter's career
<START> this was without a doubt the worst thing i have ever spent money on i feel dirty for <UNK> that i rented this <UNK> and actually paid money to see it this does not even rate trash no no this is the juice that <UNK> at the bottom of industrial <UNK> located in particularly foul <UNK> after an extraordinarily <UNK> summer to call it trash would be to <UNK> trash everywhere it was so bad i felt i had to register at imdb and warn my fellow man this <UNK> character claims this movie is great one has to question his grasp on reality let's take some of his comments and analyze them br br the actor who played ricky i forgot his name did a very good job br br i see well if the director <UNK> his audience cringing and <UNK> at every sentence <UNK> by ricky or alternately <UNK> into <UNK> laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers then yes ricky did an outstanding job br br i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off br br wow i too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes <UNK> you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these <UNK> pulled it off still they can help you if you need to practice crying just watch the movie ha ha ha br br bring on the sequel br br if i was your theater teacher at school i'd fail you based solely on this comment alone br br i am too disgusted to continue i shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate mr <UNK> br br <UNK> if you've continued to read this far i take it for granted that you've already seen the movie and you're now looking for one of two things in this comment 1 additional <UNK> <UNK> of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie 2 additional <UNK> <UNK> of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such <UNK> <UNK> as myself whether you want help <UNK> your disgust or <UNK> for a stirring <UNK> if i say anything good it'll only disappoint you so let me assure you there is little chance of such disappointment br br the other negative comments here at imdb have already <UNK> the particular <UNK> of the movie e g the acting the soundtrack the directing the dialogue the editing etc however all of these faults can readily be forgiven in and of themselves few people will rent a movie titled hood of the living dead if they require these elements to be top notch the ultimate failure of hood however is its failure to deliver on the <UNK> promise of its name hood of the living dead practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its <UNK> of corny one liners and <UNK> creative kills here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto to have <UNK> thug zombies <UNK> on the innocent living while <UNK> do <UNK> to have undead <UNK> <UNK> over all too mortal <UNK> <UNK> in their tricked out rides the mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious instead the movie is more like watching middle school kids <UNK> deliver the lines to a play they are performing but don't understand to avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their video rental audience i suggest that the <UNK> brothers re release the movie with the following new title hood of the living dead a home made horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored or perhaps they could release it as a documentary the day creativity died an exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio br br the potential <UNK> whose interest has not been <UNK> should find the following <UNK> on the back of the video case the <UNK> brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting mr <UNK>
<START> the domino principle is without question one of the worst thrillers ever made hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream i give up br br how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their <UNK> br br i hope they spent their money well
<START> tom the cat jerry the mouse and spike the dog here called butch his third name his second being <UNK> decide to sign a peace <UNK> to all love each other it's weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their friend's seem to think so too but by the end thanks to a <UNK> over a <UNK> everything is back to normal and all is how it should be this short is the second one of three on the new spotlight dvd to be edited and i have no clue why this one was this cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of tom jerry br br my grade b
<START> a lonely depressed french boy mathieu <UNK> <UNK> on vacation in the summer meets and falls in love with cedric the gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie on one hand i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys on the other i was getting annoyed the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason it's very confusing and pointless br br spoilers ahead br br also there are tons of plot holes mathieu at one point does something that ends him up in the hospital what is it we're never told then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else he's living with him why we're not told then he <UNK> up inexplicably with another guy at the end why no explanation it's clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much if only things were explained br br <UNK> as mathieu is not good he's tall handsome and has a nice body but he can't act his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face all the time <UNK> on the other hand is great he's very handsome has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor also he has an incredible sexual <UNK> about him there is full frontal male nudity lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great most movies shy away from showing male male love scenes this one doesn't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other br br so a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing especially for <UNK> nude scenes that is if you like good looking nude young men br br
<START> if jean <UNK> first film <UNK> of fate first takes us into the world of the countryside the rivers the lives of the <UNK> that he will continue to explore it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the <UNK> the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way <UNK> put the characters from the first two films together and you have the <UNK> of his great grand illusion and rules of the game this is beautifully filmed with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and <UNK> areas that dominate the film's interiors and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well particularly from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but the glamorous and <UNK> ms <UNK> who at first appears as if she might give louise brooks a run for her money in <UNK> never goes beyond a one note selfish <UNK> portrayal perhaps this is in part a problem with the script which does seem to mostly go for high points and <UNK> emotions not having read the novel i'm not really clear on whether the choices were well made or not br br still the differences between <UNK> <UNK> are well drawn and i particularly liked the relationship between <UNK> and jean <UNK> <UNK> the tragic <UNK> that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous <UNK> where <UNK> warns <UNK> and we wonder if violence will <UNK> this and other <UNK> of the <UNK> of the <UNK> rich help give the film the depth it has br br far from his greatest achievement and for me probably just shy overall of <UNK> of fate this is still well worth seeing for <UNK> fans or those interested in silent cinema generally
<START> the last station director michael <UNK> melodrama about the last months in the life of leo <UNK> begins with fog and sleep <UNK> christopher plummer lives with his family in a compound at <UNK> <UNK> taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the <UNK> to his movement people dedicated to his ideas of <UNK> <UNK> sexual <UNK> and <UNK> property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away his wife sophia helen <UNK> wars openly with the head of his movement <UNK> paul <UNK> who she claims in his efforts to convince <UNK> to sign the rights to his works over to the russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is <UNK> to her upon her husbands <UNK> death <UNK> all of this is <UNK> new <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> a naive <UNK> who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife br br <UNK> script which is based on the novel by jay <UNK> quite often <UNK> itself into confused territory building up a complex <UNK> of threads and <UNK> motivations that ultimately don't resolve themselves in any satisfying way the scope of the film is grand and its story should <UNK> just as <UNK> whose beliefs <UNK> in some ways both the <UNK> and those of <UNK> like <UNK> it unfortunately doesn't it's un <UNK> building up with much gusto <UNK> that are constantly <UNK> off into <UNK> the three way relationship between the church the faithful sophia and the <UNK> <UNK> for example is <UNK> often in the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up but the script never <UNK> on this beyond <UNK> <UNK> it into the story as an attempt at <UNK> it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy there are a ton of details in the film but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels <UNK> <UNK> energetic but unfortunately pointless br br at its heart is the love story between sophia and <UNK> and that story as <UNK> and <UNK> as it is is the reason to watch the film <UNK> and plummer are <UNK> the best things in the film <UNK> <UNK> is vague at once confused and <UNK> <UNK> and full of joy and <UNK> <UNK> sophia is in full panic in a righteous <UNK> forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time his <UNK> and his money to people who are <UNK> devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own <UNK> they're great performances all the more so given the vast <UNK> between the real importance of the <UNK> place in history and the <UNK> ability to support that both sophia and <UNK> seem <UNK> into the film by <UNK> and plummer alone both making the best they can out of what <UNK> material is there <UNK> and <UNK> both talented actors are unable to do the same and <UNK> <UNK> seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief and not both at once either but rather a <UNK> a stand in for a whole package of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> historical <UNK> the scope of this thing never <UNK> down to anything it <UNK> along getting by on the strength of plummer and <UNK> and not much else it's interesting and pretty but ultimately <UNK> 4 5 10
<START> this movie works because it feels so genuine the story is simple and realistic perfectly capturing the <UNK> and <UNK> of adolescent love and sexuality that most all of us experienced during our teen years br br the actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers the dialogue is fresh and honest and thankfully not filled to the <UNK> with <UNK> pop culture references also the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful bringing the lower east side setting to life in a very <UNK> way br br on an artistic level i love this movie because it reminds me of great italian neo realism films like the <UNK> thief and la <UNK> movies rarely feel as real as this does or as <UNK> thief did and the only other movie i've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the grass writer director peter <UNK> deserves tremendous praise this film is quite an achievement br br on a personal level i am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic america with love and respect as an italian american i hate the way my own people come off in the cinema as racist <UNK> criminal geniuses in <UNK> popular epics and my <UNK> on this count makes me <UNK> sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in particular seem cursed to playing villains in westerns and action movies good thing <UNK> li didn't try to become famous in america br br of course thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures and the influence of <UNK> we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there but raising victor vargas is easily one of the best while i do really like my big fat greek wedding it is a refreshing change that raising victor vargas is played straight with less exaggerated and <UNK> drawn characters while still being very funny in its own right finally latino characters worthy of note i have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered br br of course now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the <UNK> republic i hope peter <UNK> gets around to making a movie about italians soon marc <UNK>
<START> this is <UNK> to much so frustrating to watch i was waiting for the whole damn movie to end and to finally get some answers and what i've had in the end was nothing but a <UNK> <UNK> sign question mark above my head i haven't seen such a bad acting and such a nonsense movie in a long long time and what's bothering me is how come someone an actor read the script of such a bull movie and say ok i'm in let's film this this is horrible this movie <UNK> i just can't believe i've spent an hour and a half of my life on something like this
<START> what is interesting is that the acting was not bad just not enough it was rather lame special effects nor the lines were the single <UNK> for this failure standing alone they weren't horribly bad but put together was a tragic move the show seemed long <UNK> and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along but it failed totally br br much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects don't believe it they were kinda cool <UNK> was not the best choice for this <UNK> though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan <UNK> an experienced actress would have brought something to the part like <UNK> never did <UNK> puts out some really good original movies it's just too bad that this failed so drastically
<START> first of all when people hear <UNK> <UNK> they immediately think of snatch yes snatch was a good movie but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch they don't expect him to explore new <UNK> this movie revolver is different than snatch it's much darker and is very complex the reason i gave a rating of 10 is because i've had to watch revolver 3 times to understand everything so this movie toys with your head it's very cleverly written br br this movie is different than snatch it was done wonderfully the cinematography is beautiful and you can recognize guy <UNK> personal touch style of directing in it br br what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers
<START> this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well an exciting plot and a great performance from it's main villain <UNK> he will really shock you with his evil ways the movie does not rank an all time great <UNK> of the weak screen play the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters they chose to <UNK> <UNK> character in this one which is ok but considering the <UNK> style <UNK> the excitement factor also the dialogue was cheesy and <UNK> condescending at times the script should have been more realistic and less talky another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes the movie makers should have been more <UNK> how they <UNK> the shooting hits and misses they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane <UNK> early in the movie instead they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences ala a team tv series as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops this movie had a lot of all time great potential <UNK> action sequences better dialogue and more rambo rocky style emotion determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level i know this was not <UNK> fault i sense the movie's director wanted to tone down <UNK> character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer <UNK> a good movie though
<START> <UNK> letter <UNK> is a low budget film about a couple of employees of the australian <UNK> service struggling to <UNK> their damaged lives unfortunately the acting is poor and the <UNK> between the characters' past <UNK> and present <UNK> are clumsily and over <UNK> represented what's most disappointing of all however is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title there's no <UNK> whatsoever and it's quite impossible to <UNK> what any of the staff really do for a living granted part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s if it ever truly existed it's a shame as the film's overall tone is poignant and <UNK> and there's some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince overall it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life a student film with a concept and an outline but sadly little else
<START> seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb <UNK> perhaps it's because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and <UNK> without depth or are we missing something i'd watch it again if i had some <UNK> br br so what's a <UNK> to the french it is le <UNK> <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> fate perhaps it's an event that is the <UNK> of a series of random happenings we've all had these it's called life but when looked at in this way you begin to get the feeling that random might be more like <UNK> br br a <UNK> in this film might be an <UNK> as minor as knocking a few leaves of <UNK> off the back of a truck or as major as <UNK> a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger <UNK> of a <UNK> all these incidents cause other events that well you get the picture <UNK> <UNK> those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen and i think that there's a <UNK> for those who believe that life is like this but then this is the magic world of cinema br br we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which <UNK> the lives of these french citizens if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape here's the place to do it or if you're recovering from surgery and aren't going anywhere anyway this will engage you while your <UNK> are healing br br <UNK> will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following stranger things have happened br br <UNK> <UNK> is attributed with the following life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences meeting your first love finding the perfect gift your last auto accident you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it br br that's the answer i forgot to bring along an <UNK> to explain <UNK> to me
<START> i'm sure that <UNK> <UNK> was a favorite at the drive ins back in the day there's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise <UNK> and if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some <UNK> <UNK> on screen to get you in the mood br br otherwise there ain't a whole lot that <UNK> <UNK> has going for it it's set in the korean war where a platoon of <UNK> together with a british tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the un lines bad enough already but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of <UNK> girls and their choreographer in the same <UNK> br br you know what's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the army and in combat situations these <UNK> from the <UNK> set women's <UNK> back light years in fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants br br but that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive in for this no name cast is better off with me not <UNK> any of them for any individual effort br br <UNK> <UNK> is definitely a team flop
<START> this is the page for house of <UNK> but most people have confused this film with the mario <UNK> masterpiece lisa the devil which explains the ridiculously high rating for this house of <UNK> when lisa the devil was shown at film festivals in the early 70's it was a critical success audiences <UNK> well to that gorgeous gothic horror film unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it's time and was considered too unusual and not commercial enough for mass <UNK> no <UNK> would buy it so producer <UNK> <UNK> decided to edit <UNK> seemingly with a chainsaw by <UNK> just about half of the original film and adding new scenes which he filmed two years after the original product it is important to note that <UNK> had little to do with these new hideous <UNK> so technically house of <UNK> is not a <UNK> film the original product is a slow dreamy classy production a few minutes into the film the viewer is <UNK> out of this dream world as suddenly we see lisa two years older and with a very different <UNK> begin to <UNK> on the ground making <UNK> sounds and <UNK> <UNK> like suck my co k etc subtle huh and the film continues like this jumping back and forth between a beautiful visual film and a grade z exorcist rip off <UNK> was trying to <UNK> these shock scenes while keeping some semblance of a story intact he failed miserably when the choice was made to basically destroy lisa and the devil <UNK> himself refused saying that his film was too beautiful to cut he was right and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and <UNK> down the toilet it was many years before the original lisa and the devil was seen again re <UNK> on late night television i had seen lisa long before i saw this new version and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films <UNK> in this way worth seeing only for curiosity sake otherwise avoid this <UNK> disaster like the plague
<START> this movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme i used to love superman movies but this one made me want to shoot myself very poor acting outrageous special effects and a plot equal to zero to <UNK> superman leaves earth because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet some were in space duh doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving duh again takes off in a spaceship comes back i think 5 years later and look forward to <UNK> up with his girlfriend again who is now <UNK> his son which son in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old and what about that lex luthor trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land please br br i vote 1 out of 10 for this movie only because i am not allowed to vote 0 if you have anything else to do with your time don't go to see this movie and even if you don't have anything else to do stay home and watch tv
<START> possible spoiler br br you d think a story involving <UNK> grey owl an <UNK> posing as a red indian would have a massive amount of humour involved in fact i d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the <UNK> public is to treat it as a comedy however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama worse he s made an extremely dire film too pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and <UNK> played by the equally wooden annie <UNK> lacks any type of on screen chemistry but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> he is of <UNK> everyone into believing he s a native american the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of <UNK> being an <UNK> that s why i wrote possible spoiler it s not actually revealed <UNK> late in the film that the title character is english but it s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there s absolutely no surprise involved br br yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep <UNK> message which <UNK> t actually a new concept theodore <UNK> was the first important <UNK> of the 20th century if truth be told and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message that there <UNK> t actually been a great <UNK> film in fact most <UNK> <UNK> films suck and that includes grey owl a film that <UNK> had a serious problem in finding a <UNK>
<START> like another reviewer said this movie is not a heavy melodrama but it deals with harsh realities a very very playful movie that does not <UNK> for a moment some very good acting and some wonderful smiles as well
<START> i paid one dollar for this dvd and at first i was feeling ripped off but then i started thinking about it and i should be grateful i have found a holy grail a real <UNK> of bad cinema if you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully <UNK> with <UNK> awkward camera address monologue then wait until the opening credits roll on the <UNK> butt the script seems to be <UNK> together from press <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but i just can't believe how bad george hamilton is he seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says the only internal monologue i can <UNK> is gosh i bet they think i am cute really cute this is an <UNK> i now know how bad it can get
<START> <UNK> the only reason i'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis in the box apart from that how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time there are no laughs to mention the stereotypes are pathetic the cast is wasted the direction is amateurish now that i think about it most of the blame probably lies with the director joel <UNK> he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved don't waste your time like i did but then i enjoy a good train wreck <UNK> now the system is telling me i need more lines here ya go this movie should be called return to <UNK> okay now that was funnier than anything in the movie
<START> airport <UNK> starts as a brand new luxury <UNK> plane is loaded up with valuable paintings such <UNK> to rich businessman philip stevens james stewart who is flying them a bunch of <UNK> to his estate in <UNK> of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is stevens daughter julie kathleen <UNK> her son the luxury <UNK> takes off as planned but mid air the plane is hi <UNK> by the co pilot <UNK> robert <UNK> his two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wilson michael <UNK> who knock the passengers crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable <UNK> land on a <UNK> plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent <UNK> almost hits an oil <UNK> in the ocean loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the <UNK> triangle with air in short supply water <UNK> in having <UNK> over 200 miles off course the problems <UNK> for the <UNK> as they <UNK> help with time fast running out br br also known under the slightly different <UNK> airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash hit disaster thriller airport 1970 was directed by jerry jameson while once again like it's predecessors i can't say airport <UNK> is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best just it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid air hi <UNK> then the crashing didn't he see the oil <UNK> sinking of the <UNK> maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the <UNK> adventure 1972 <UNK> is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either <UNK> when the air runs out or <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> or if any of the doors are opened it's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's dull dialogue <UNK> set pieces a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity while the rather <UNK> plot keeps one entertained for <UNK> odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks there's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been even when the navy become involved things don't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships <UNK> flying about but there's just something lacking here george kennedy as the <UNK> <UNK> worker joe <UNK> is back but only gets a couple of scenes barely even says anything <UNK> to just look worried in the background br br the home video theatrical version of airport <UNK> run <UNK> minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with george kennedy as <UNK> flashbacks to flesh out character's longer rescue scenes the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the <UNK> while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport <UNK> as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions interior design choices i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren't great either along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the <UNK> <UNK> hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i <UNK> that's a little harsh the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i <UNK> this could have been a pretty good film if made properly br br the production values are alright if nothing spectacular the acting isn't great two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time oscar winner james stewart looks old <UNK> also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too br br airport <UNK> is the most disaster <UNK> of the three airport films so far i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production bland direction doesn't help though a film about a <UNK> plane just shouldn't be this boring or <UNK> followed by the <UNK> airport <UNK> 1979

<START> the premise of the story is simple an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred though very little dialog is provided throughout the film the visual narrative told by the <UNK> eye alone made the film quite engaging the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness which <UNK> the <UNK> of the characters themselves we can also sense <UNK> in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder which parallels the <UNK> child's inability to tell her own story br br true horror lies in feelings of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> this film successfully <UNK> these elements by visuals alone rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak br br cleverly the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments the ending is also unexpected and believable reminiscent of japanese horror films such as the ring and dark water or english horror films such as lady in black and the <UNK> this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try br br by the way if you haven't seen the films i just mentioned above you might want to give them a try as well
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has given it all raw but the best part is he hasn't forgotten to give the ingredients it has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth <UNK> of the <UNK> attached to it br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a journalist and enjoys her work a simple and peaceful life <UNK> her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate pearl she covers the page 3 celebrity page of nation today where she has a very supportive editor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but life takes turn for her as she hits the first <UNK> and takes herself away from page 3 and goes into crime bit <UNK> a whole new world was waiting for her there she is shocked excited stunned with the revelation her reaction has resulted in losing the job at the end she is back to page 3 now when she meets any celebrity in a party she knows the actual looks of each hidden under the <UNK> face br br the movie has a message and it is crude the audience needs to get it in their own color the theme and the screenplay was fantastic there are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences like the <UNK> club is shown before the <UNK> <UNK> the short suspense before gay actions in bathroom the dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it <UNK> <UNK> 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in <UNK> those two words with such <UNK> it leaves an impact the set <UNK> could have been better the songs don't stand anywhere but they were needed in the background <UNK> <UNK> has a small role with high impact there were a few flaws visible <UNK> <UNK> explaining <UNK> <UNK> that honesty should be <UNK> along with intelligence there could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a <UNK> the meeting between <UNK> and his daughter doesn't call for acting that scene looks very <UNK> br br overall it is a must watch movie with <UNK> <UNK> before the <UNK> incident that may spoil your mood

<START> this film reminded me of the sopranos and not in a good way br br david <UNK> <UNK> mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season when junior soprano went on trial for his life rather than pursue this riveting and pivotal plot line the writers instead chose to completely ignore it focusing instead on bobby <UNK> constant <UNK> over his recently deceased wife's frozen <UNK> dish br br when something of genuine interest happens in notorious for example that first mysterious assassination attempt on <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> the whole east coast west coast <UNK> in the first place and ended up leading to the deaths of both <UNK> and christopher wallace the film treats it as just another bit of plot to <UNK> through why exactly was <UNK> so convinced that he was sold out by his own people did he alone <UNK> his subsequent <UNK> with <UNK> knight and was <UNK> <UNK> transformation from <UNK> office <UNK> into sex obsessed <UNK> <UNK> really as banal as it appears here br br none of these questions are even <UNK> addressed by the film's screenwriters who are far more interested in depicting <UNK> <UNK> love life to zero compelling dramatic <UNK> these sequences including a brain <UNK> clichéd <UNK> <UNK> in a hotel room are so <UNK> and <UNK> manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network tv movie br br the storytelling in both structure and content is simplistic and trite but more <UNK> as a biopic as something designed to celebrate its subject and <UNK> the <UNK> on the <UNK> of their life and work the film is almost entirely worthless the <UNK> on meat and <UNK> genre plotting coupled with the lifeless musical performances an area in which a film like this should <UNK> surely result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the <UNK> and demands of those involved leaving <UNK> questionable status as a giant in his field as the <UNK> of the easily <UNK> and previously converted only br br and the final twenty minutes in which <UNK> <UNK> cultural identity is <UNK> painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint quite frankly made me feel like throwing up br br on that score much as with any other notorious is crass <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> like the <UNK> good times was one of the those classic american sitcoms which was never aired in the uk not to mention it came out in the 1970s a decade where of which i wasn't born yet br br but like most fans of the show i watched a few episodes on you tube and afterwards i loved it br br the evans family are headed by james and florida two parents trying to make ends meet and who despite their lack of <UNK> encourage their children who have their own aspirations in life to <UNK> them and to take their chances james was the strict but loving dad who didn't dare hesitate in <UNK> j j michael and thelma should they over step the line whilst florida in contrast was a fair kind hearted and <UNK> mother and loving wife although she was in many ways similar to james with regards to their attitudes to <UNK> and family values from an <UNK> american perspective br br the kids were just as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves j j was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and crazy sense of humour who would often wear multi <UNK> outfits and whose <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> is as <UNK> and familiar as arnold jackson's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> willis ' from <UNK> <UNK> michael was the smart alec who dreams of becoming a lawyer whilst sister thelma had her own dreams and hopes her verbal <UNK> with j j were mostly hilarious as was the love hate relationship between brother and sister which was played out extremely well by both mike evans and <UNK> <UNK> br br over the seasons there were a few cameo appearances made most notably from janet jackson debbie allen and a young gary coleman as himself i actually prefer good times over say the <UNK> show which was an 80s show because a i preferred the evans family over the <UNK> both in terms of a characterisation and b as i felt it <UNK> serious and difficult social issues in a way that <UNK> with many viewers it was a comedy but it was also a social commentary which aimed to highlight the lives of working class <UNK> americans in 1970s america the <UNK> show attempted to <UNK> to the mainstream audience in a <UNK> <UNK> way as the <UNK> were portrayed as blacks who easily <UNK> themselves into an upper class u s culture we would associate whites with whereas good times in contrast was much more <UNK> and it was not afraid to address themes such as drug and child abuse in a realistic way i actually found that whilst the <UNK> show can be fun to watch at times it lacked that bit of <UNK> which good times has and of which made it <UNK> and <UNK> br br the show did jump the shark during the latter seasons as it continued after john <UNK> character james died in a freak accident in reality it was known at the time that john had quit good times for good and so his character's death was written as it is on the show without john the show suffered and alas it lost a lot of its charm br br still for a sitcom good times <UNK> all the right boxes if only they had shown this in the uk during the 80s as it certainly is as <UNK> would put it <UNK> no <UNK> ' br br my rating 8 and a half

<START> i'll give this movie two stars because it <UNK> with beautiful photography otherwise it <UNK> mainly with clichés and stereotypes mountain people are either dumb white trash of the <UNK> religious or <UNK> racist kind or wise white indians indians are magical people who move around without a sound can disappear in the blink of an eye talk to animals and read minds over large <UNK> and so on and so forth br br throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains <UNK> <UNK> woods an assortment of animals free spirited mountain <UNK> and freaky people in church br br the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth this was neither a story about growing up during the depression nor about about being an orphan nor about a struggle for identity it tried to be all of those things and more which made it superficial and <UNK> br br although the movie was supposed to be about little <UNK> education we learn almost nothing about it he was given a brief summary of the history of his people who were brave and stoic and a <UNK> <UNK> tried his hand at <UNK> wood at which he failed and <UNK> running literally learned how to read and maybe to write with the help of grandma and her <UNK> and that was it apparently he didn't learn much during his <UNK> in <UNK> school because he was locked up in the attic br br however grandma and grandpa and graham <UNK> character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult after and i'm <UNK> here riding with the <UNK> and getting caught up in a couple of wars was to catch up with grandma and grandpa and graham <UNK> character in heaven instead of say dating girls getting married having children or other such nonsense br br last but not least i must say that i found <UNK> trade offensive why of all things did it have to be a <UNK> still to <UNK> the stereotype of the drunken indian
<START> it seems hal hartley's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences this film will be no exception to that rule fay grim acts as a sequel to hartley's <UNK> <UNK> from 1998 the focus this time is on <UNK> ex wife played to perfection by the always welcome parker posey who is being <UNK> by cia <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> book about all of his shady <UNK> in the <UNK> of all of this fay ends up on an odyssey dealing with international spies etc the film does get a bit <UNK> down in the second half if you've been a fan of hal hartley in the past this is one not to be missed for the <UNK> hartley first <UNK> who has only heard of his film making technique you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one especially if you haven't seen <UNK> yet i admired the camera work which at times reminded me of certain early man ray photography
<START> since the <UNK> of literature people of all <UNK> have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love love that cannot be the israeli filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> latest film <UNK> bubble is about that and then it is also not the title of the film refers to the <UNK> that is tel <UNK> set against the background of the political realities of israel the country's <UNK> and <UNK> capital city doesn't have much in common with <UNK> a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film it doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the palestinian <UNK> actually it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it the <UNK> of tel <UNK> allows people to have a lifestyle which isn't much different from what you may expect in any western city teenage girls looking for britney <UNK> records a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue trendy people sitting in trendy <UNK> discussing trendy things over <UNK> of <UNK> and other similarly trendy drinks while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol it is this <UNK> that also has the potential to <UNK> one's mind into a false sense of reality br br the film <UNK> around the lives of three young <UNK> who share a flat and for the most part try to stay out of politics <UNK> the camp owner and manager of <UNK> ella a hip <UNK> rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the <UNK> that <UNK> them noam a soft and <UNK> employee of a slightly <UNK> record store seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and <UNK> <UNK> the only female of the lot is on the contrary linked to the israeli left although her political activities seem to be confined to <UNK> against the <UNK> <UNK> and noam naturally don't object to <UNK> in these <UNK> and her political friends make t shirts with the <UNK> <UNK> put up posters and hand out <UNK> advertising it in the <UNK> their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual <UNK> <UNK> and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a <UNK> with some not so palestinian friendly locals who try to prevent them from <UNK> out the <UNK> in other words predictable products of the <UNK> br br the opening scenes of the film take us to a <UNK> on a road to <UNK> where we also find noam doing his <UNK> duty a group of <UNK> is being thoroughly checked before entering israel among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into <UNK> and gives birth to a <UNK> child despite the best efforts from noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an <UNK> the woman is <UNK> by a young man who later turns up on <UNK> <UNK> in tel <UNK> with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border his name is <UNK> he's palestinian and he's gay and he hasn't just come to hand back the id he has come to see noam without a <UNK> to live in israel and despite the initial <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> he stays he soon gets a jewish name and a job at <UNK> <UNK> having grown up in <UNK> with <UNK> he doesn't have an <UNK> accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to <UNK> his identity the sky is light blue and the air is sweet but it cannot last for he has become part of an <UNK> which was never meant to be br br at one point noam and <UNK> watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards they find a way of being together on another level a <UNK> one a level where no one else has access this is also where our couple arrives in the end and it couldn't have been much different for them not in today's israel br br <UNK> bubble is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today's israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist <UNK> bubble is also a beautiful film about people gay and straight <UNK> that strange city tel <UNK> shown through the eyes of people who really care about them the film's premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat <UNK> but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you <UNK>
<START> when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv i was really looking forward to it i grew up in the 1980's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era have seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie out there so i couldn't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre what a disappointment the movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over with hardly any plot and no substance and the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed some of these so called jokes didn't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive the only good things about this film were the wardrobe music and acting it was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80's and the same goes for the music and the acting was top notch throughout almost all of hollywood's best comedians were present too bad they didn't have better material to work with
<START> my complaints here concern the movie's pacing and the material at hand while using <UNK> film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting such as when <UNK> complains about this or that <UNK> <UNK> or the ad <UNK> footage of his small german hometown also the movie <UNK> along in covering c <UNK> 1939 and then <UNK> through the war years in sum the film is little better than a history channel documentary with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more <UNK> <UNK> the details of <UNK> life still i found it wanting
<START> i really liked this movie because i have a husband just like the guy in this movie this movie is about lindsey who meets ben in the middle of winter when baseball season isn't in she falls in love but when spring comes along she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her <UNK> that ben has put her on br br it's a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that ben has he can't part from what he loves the most that's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to lindsey in real life also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he is br br it's a funny movie and you won't strike out if you rent this one
<START> tim meadows has to be the most underrated of <UNK> recent cast members what initially was a low brow look at a sleazy <UNK> develops into a thoroughly entertaining 90 minute run albeit still low brow don't pop this one in expecting beautiful cinematography or oscar worthy performances walk into it expecting brilliant silliness with tim meadows and will ferrell doing what they do best making the audience laugh br br leon the <UNK> man <UNK> is a naive likable radio sex show host who knows very little about anything except the ways of the wang as a gifted ladies man he lays waste to the wives of countless <UNK> who've <UNK> together in order to hunt him down the director does an inspired job of <UNK> the actors on a comedic <UNK> which makes up completely for the lack of plot development how much plot would one expect from an snl skit while some scenes are a little off the mark for the most part <UNK> one liners and absurd sexual comments hit the funny bone <UNK> for instance in one scene meadows <UNK> himself to mother <UNK> but for <UNK> sure it's crass but don't we all in the <UNK> of our homes get a chuckle out of his advice to an entire city for <UNK> it in the butt in another scene immediately after a heartfelt kiss with the female lead he suddenly remembers the name of his would be <UNK> a woman he slept with years ago he stands up in front of the woman who's obviously fallen for him and <UNK> that the <UNK> man is back to her obvious <UNK> br br billy dee williams hits the ball out of the park as the bartender narrator will ferrell the repressed homosexual rounds out solid performances br br see this movie if you're into adult humor if not stay away with extreme prejudice
<START> not exactly a new story line but this romantic comedy makes the concept work a young man john cusack and a drop dead gorgeous woman kate beckinsale keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other although both are promised to others oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere a little sappy in some places but <UNK> la love being a romantic i am almost <UNK> to be <UNK> my favorite scene is where cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling the finale is almost too sweet but most deserving this is not one of <UNK> deeper roles but who in the hell could not be smitten by beckinsale notable support is provided by jeremy <UNK> and molly shannon john corbett plays the worst role i've ever seen him in on the other hand eugene levy is quirky and funny watch this with your soul mate
<START> i don't see how this show is like the <UNK> at all br br first of all the <UNK> centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life north shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time second the <UNK> takes place in california north shore takes place in hawaii br br and why would fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part it has a good storyline and plot i like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out the most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out it wasn't predictable like most stories on most shows br br i hope fox keeps it on the air
<START> i am watching this movie right now on <UNK> because that was the channel that the tv was turned to when i turned it on it is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a <UNK> wife alexandra paul falling in lust with a young stud drifter with <UNK> <UNK> played by corey <UNK> there may or may not be a plot corey <UNK> his shirt off a lot and alexandra <UNK> i'm getting the feeling he's supposed to be up to no good and that's why he's messing with skinny alexandra paul it's not really important because as i said he takes his shirt off a lot and i just caught a glimpse of butt <UNK> there's a lot of <UNK> on the soundtrack which is just painful
<START> a delightfully <UNK> send up of romeo and juliet approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one a talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light hearted <UNK> vehicle bad reviews were due to a <UNK> about <UNK> of shakespeare some people feel that all film must be important if you share those views don't bother the credits read introducing angelina jolie which is not even close to being true but she is <UNK> beautiful as the juliet character and as always her acting is wonderful and considering her age at the time even her <UNK> is pretty good <UNK> this classic tale with <UNK> italian families in the <UNK> business in new york results in great fun see it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud
<START> in fact these young people were so <UNK> that i couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered and that includes <UNK> joanna <UNK> since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch br br but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background it had nowhere to go but down br br even the <UNK> looked fake and the blood looked <UNK> like <UNK> punch although later on it took on red day <UNK> look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing i'm sure all the <UNK> morons out there will appreciate this <UNK> t since it'll appeal to that bunch it sure didn't appeal to me blah br br and not even my favorite horror babe <UNK> <UNK> can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself she still looks hot though i'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays br br however it is a step up from <UNK> <UNK> meandering horror 2002 in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so i'll give it that much that and the little boston <UNK> named <UNK> also brings it up a notch i like what <UNK> does to <UNK> in the end it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film br br <UNK> gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up br br 2 out of 10
<START> tony scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in richard kelly's clichéd <UNK> overwrought screenplay domino harvey <UNK> knightley was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter this is her story sort of br br the problem with this rubbish is that there isn't much of a story at all and scott's extreme graphic <UNK> of every shot acts as a <UNK> <UNK> that makes us indifferent to everything in <UNK> chaotic life br br you just don't care about harvey knightley plays her as an obnoxious cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect she punches people she doesn't like and <UNK> her clothes and <UNK> when the situation calls for it but she isn't the least bit real and <UNK> isn't the least bit convincing either br br the film is boring it's loud too and <UNK> with one of the most annoying source music scores i've heard in a long time the final twenty minutes are a poor re run of scott's true romance climax with <UNK> gang going to meet two sets of <UNK> bad guys who are surprise surprise destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a las vegas casino br br unfortunately this potentially exciting <UNK> is totally <UNK> by scott and becomes a confusing pretentious pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation this is not an artistically brave or experimental piece it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and <UNK> of its characters br br mickey <UNK> looks good as a <UNK> bounty hunter but he disappears into the background as the narrative progresses chris walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and <UNK> coleman always solid is <UNK> br br don't be fooled by this film's multi layered gimmick ridden surface it is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it
<START> this may not be war peace but the two academy <UNK> wouldn't have been <UNK> if it weren't for the genius of james wong <UNK> br br this is one of the few films i've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without <UNK> whether you have any interest in what it offers <UNK> or not <UNK> c is a visual feast br br i'm not saying it's his best work i'm no expert there for sure but the look of this movie is amazing i love everything about it elsa <UNK> the cat the crazy <UNK> doo the retro downtown <UNK> but the way it was put on film is breathtaking br br i even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above and the special effects that seem <UNK> now it all creates a really consistent world
<START> richard <UNK> decided to <UNK> and so michael <UNK> took his place playing the role as ted <UNK> who meets up with a young french girl named alice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this couple only knew each other for two days and they decided to get married by a justice of the peace judge and it is <UNK> rain when they pull up to the <UNK> home and find out he is not home and will not return until the next day as the couple are inside the house you see some one lift up the hood of their car and takes an <UNK> part from the engine once you see this event happening you realize this couple is in for a big surprise and the story beings to reveal a very mysterious event which <UNK> alice <UNK> and so poor ted <UNK> starts out with plenty of trouble and no marriage good mystery but i missed richard <UNK> enjoy
<START> actually they could not have chosen a better <UNK> actor to portray little richard than leon he captures little richard to a most believable essence the outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie although the movie is a little long it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of little richard in mind the ending should have taken a direction of moving little richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium he will always be the king of rock n roll as far as i am concerned regardless of what the other media says
<START> a real head <UNK> of a film by bill <UNK> who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties three <UNK> <UNK> invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given 1 million provided he or she makes it that far a series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get <UNK> at the hotel bar most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a <UNK> of american <UNK> meets <UNK> <UNK> complete with <UNK> if there was any <UNK> that white people can't dance this scene <UNK> the final nail in that coffin pay close attention for the <UNK> slip this continues on for about forty five minutes until bill <UNK> begins throwing <UNK> at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess it's a game until it's not a game the three old <UNK> are in complete control until they're not the hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props they're dead until they're not even the narrator at the end replies that he doesn't know what the hell happened i defy anyone to reason where <UNK> was going on this one the acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local <UNK> i give it a few points for the scene where the <UNK> broad opens the closet and a <UNK> is inside skull <UNK> himself let's see gone with the wind do that this chilling classics collection is really becoming the <UNK> of me <UNK> get it like <UNK> i hate myself
<START> a very gritty <UNK> portrayal of a part of world war 2 history that most of us in the u s had have no idea ever occurred i would love to have this on video it only was shown on t v one time as far as i know back in <UNK> 90 i have asked around for this movie and most video stores don't even know about it great actresses all around wish that i could see it again top notch series
<START> well jesus of <UNK> is basically an intelligent movie the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay but although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion i am an <UNK> it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow <UNK> funny end why is this movie so incredibly boring i don't know it just is and so it is not <UNK>
<START> i voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws other than that this movie is one of my favorites it's entertaining to say the least the shooting scenes are ridiculous though and i think gackt who wrote the book takes a little bit too much of his matrix obsession into it it seems like their enemies just stands there waiting to get shot at however this movie is touching and it always makes me cry it has a lot of great humor in it so it makes me laugh as well gackt is a superb actor i must say he shows so much emotion this was <UNK> first time acting and he did okay the role fits him wang lee <UNK> is absolutely great the whole cast is what i would say perfect for this movie don't miss it you'll regret it
<START> in frank sinatra's first three films he was purely a <UNK> act ostensibly playing himself he merely shows up to <UNK> a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie in his fourth film the very enjoyable <UNK> and <UNK> young blue eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role a task made easier because he's playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to <UNK> a few numbers br br sinatra's entrance is quite funny <UNK> morgan hears a knock at the door and asks who's there from outside a <UNK> toned voice answers <UNK> <UNK> sure enough br br the opening credits of <UNK> and <UNK> may confuse some viewers as the names of <UNK> <UNK> and hart are <UNK> displayed in fact they only contributed one song to this musical <UNK> <UNK> which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song <UNK> a <UNK> interestingly that <UNK> hart song one of their weakest is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie's score several others are lively up <UNK> numbers notably <UNK> a most important <UNK> <UNK> it comes to love you're on your <UNK> and 'i saw you <UNK> br br sinatra's good in this movie but he would do better work and sing better material elsewhere the real merits of <UNK> and <UNK> are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films paul and grace <UNK> were an extremely popular husband wife dance team who starred in several broadway <UNK> genuinely <UNK> ballroom dancers they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material here grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of paul's hands grace <UNK> who died of cancer at age 48 did almost no film work so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close up to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her <UNK> uniform after grace <UNK> death her husband had a long career as a character actor just occasionally dancing solo or alongside ken <UNK> in one memorable episode of <UNK> <UNK> br br also quite attractive in a <UNK> uniform here in <UNK> and <UNK> is the <UNK> teenage singer <UNK> <UNK> why didn't this talented girl make more movies perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty <UNK> i enjoy <UNK> performances but i like <UNK> <UNK> even better near the end of <UNK> and <UNK> there's an amusing bit of physical business featuring <UNK> and mary <UNK> as <UNK> taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub the <UNK> <UNK> of short <UNK> and tall <UNK> <UNK> are hilarious <UNK> although leon errol plays a large role in <UNK> and <UNK> he is given almost no comedy business not once does he do his famous rubber <UNK> dance jack <UNK> despite his prominent billing is also wasted br br very well represented here is <UNK> wilson inevitably remembered as sam from <UNK> in that film wilson did his own singing but <UNK> his keyboard performance of <UNK> time goes <UNK> in real life wilson couldn't play piano here in <UNK> and <UNK> he sings <UNK> and gives some amusing reactions to the other players less enjoyable is mel <UNK> i mean mel <UNK> victor <UNK> gives a rare film performance here handling his dialogue <UNK> but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows br br the plot forget it <UNK> and <UNK> is <UNK> idea of a <UNK> musical but it's an enjoyable delight and i'll rate it 8 out of 10 director tim <UNK> who worked in britain as well as in hollywood deserves to be much better known
<START> the thing about my folks came in as a surprise we had no idea about what to expect the film directed by raymond <UNK> and based on a screen play by one of its stars paul reiser proved to be a pleasant time at the movies although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome this is a voyage of discovery where ben gets to know his father perhaps for the first time in his life ben sees his father for what he really is and not the mythical figure he has in his mind br br the film seems to be a vehicle for its star peter falk and he runs away with the movie as it was expected mr falk one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years is an actor of such stature he must be <UNK> with as sam <UNK> the distant father to ben he is a man that clearly is misunderstood not only by ben but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty seven years br br when muriel the <UNK> of the <UNK> clan runs away everyone goes into a panic because this woman who has been the strong figure of the family is vital to keep everyone together not knowing where she has gone sam shows up at ben's house confused as he feels abandoned suddenly by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years br br ben the youngest son takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of manhattan into the country the trip provides the excuse for ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an <UNK> figure to his younger son along the way father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children the love of sam for muriel <UNK> the many years they have known one another they seem <UNK> br br peter falk is magnificent in the film he makes an excellent sam <UNK> the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst mr falk shines as the older man and there's never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is <UNK> under him br br not being a paul reiser fan we must confess that as ben <UNK> he is right ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for muriel the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together olympia dukakis is only seen at the end of the film she makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother elizabeth <UNK> plays rachel with great style br br the film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of dan <UNK> and the excellent musical score by steven <UNK> ultimately the film shows a great team effort between its director mr <UNK> and paul reiser who wrote it for the screen br br although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience it should please anyone
<START> story goes like this netflix was late sending me my dvds so i went on down to the the <UNK> rental place known as blockbuster video they suck you know real bad they have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure yet i never want to see any of those so i saw btk killer there on the shelf all by its <UNK> self i like seeing films based on serial killers its just a part of humanity that i will never understand therefore i wanna see that kind of stuff anyways i put this dvd in and all the sudden from the very first second it sucks i'm sitting there with my b f and we are like what is this kind of crap <UNK> camera operation horrible acting the first scene in which a woman gets killed you wonder if she would rather just <UNK> <UNK> instead then a rat gets stuffed down her throat i really wonder if the director has a hard on for this crap there is nothing decent about this film all i have to say to the director is do you own a <UNK> <UNK> every shot was brutally unstable the music was awful it was like they just decided one day to make a movie they were probably gathering people from <UNK> to show up and act for them just plain awful if you make a movie like this then directing is your <UNK> not what you should be doing for a living should not make it to the dvd <UNK> <UNK> for movie buffs like myself better left at home for your friends when you are having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with then you break out your btk killer film and say wanna see this crappy movie i did once
<START> if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor then you will enjoy this flick br br i don't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this one take it for what it is a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh it ain't shakespeare but it is well done <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one better than any episode of <UNK> and shows a knack for subtle humor too bad she hasn't had many opportunities to expand on that br br tom berenger fits his role of real navy perfectly and william <UNK> does a solid job as a hustler br br throw in a walk on by hopper in the middle of the chase for the <UNK> on this <UNK> and you've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing i bought this one as soon as it was available br br brain candy
<START> john carpenter's halloween br br is it the greatest horror film of all time no maybe not to everyone but to me it is and always will be the film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart br br it's unfortunate i didn't get to see this film until twenty years after it's release but even twenty years later after so many slasher copy cats had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done then my father suggested before i go see halloween <UNK> that i whip out and rent <UNK> 1 and 2 to get the full story and after watching halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set the slasher genre br br the film's plot is simple in 1963 michael audrey myers killed his sister <UNK> in cold blood with a large butcher knife <UNK> for fifteen years where he was treated by dr sam <UNK> he escapes and returns to his hometown of <UNK> where he begins stalking three young girls laurie <UNK> an innocent <UNK> annie <UNK> a tough talking sarcastic and <UNK> van der <UNK> a beautiful and sexually <UNK> young girl dr <UNK> tracks michael here where he <UNK> the help of the town sheriff leigh <UNK> whom remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins killing them off one by one until only sweet innocent laurie is left who is the prime target on michael's list br br the casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances jamie lee curtis was stunning in her first film role as laurie <UNK> and donald <UNK> gave a thrilling performance with his small role as <UNK> nick castle who portrays michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer and his walk and body movements were perfect br br one of the great highlights of this film is it's chilling score done by john carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today the blue lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when young laurie is <UNK> against a wall after seeing her dead friends and in the shadows behind her michael's face <UNK> before he strikes michael's mask was one of the <UNK> that sent chills down my spine the most the white <UNK> face worked perfectly br br what makes this film so great is that it is not a gory film unlike the cheesy friday the 13th films in fact there is little blood in this film at all and works instead on suspense and tension br br it became so clear that halloween <UNK> movies like friday the 13th and characters like jason <UNK> whom he is a mere rip off of michael myers br br to sum it up i suggest you see this film at least once in your life as it is a landmark in film making and is without a doubt if not the greatest then one of the greatest horror films of all time
<START> i was 16 when i first saw the movie and it has always been a huge favorite of mine of course you can't deny the appeal of kristofferson in the movie how fine is that man <UNK> he still is he's the bad boy every woman secretly wants his acting is flawless he played a drunk <UNK> only the way someone who really had gone through it could and he had in <UNK> he finally got on the <UNK> so it was all very real br br the music is great and even though in later years i thought streisand was somewhat not the right person for him in a physical beauty sense i think it's more a problem for male viewers than female us <UNK> are just looking at kris and naturally the guys are looking at the female interest my husband cannot watch the movie b c of her he doesn't like her looks but i did make him sit through just the red <UNK> scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well done it was the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music <UNK> you should have seen it on my 50 <UNK> wow and lastly the transfer quality was great <UNK> widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all film br br brought back some great memories of my mom and i loving this movie together i bought a copy for her for christmas would have loved to watch it together with her last night br br i have tried to sit through the original with judy garland but i guess seeing this one first i just can't get into the earlier era watching all the concert footage in the <UNK> version was so much like what i was living at the time br br i am working my way through the commentary by streisand but she seems to only talk about herself and the songs so far she has barely even mentioned kris or details about scenes in the movie her voice sounds exactly the same now as then br br check it out if you grew up in the same era as me born in 1960 you will love it br br wendy
<START> this movie should be called plan 9 from joseph smith i think its weirdness is <UNK> the playwright seems to have read paul <UNK> the population bomb 1968 and crafted a musical response made especially for <UNK> the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of heavenly father's god's plan and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad get it br br this version was filmed in 1989 which is confusing it's <UNK> so it looks and feels like 1983 the play was actually written in 1973 and of course the <UNK> is part <UNK> part battlestar galactica some of the action takes place on earth and some in the pre existence an <UNK> <UNK> room where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the <UNK> losing their shot at <UNK> glory br br it is as <UNK> as they come but don't let the poor <UNK> spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the <UNK> kids' are all into population control presumably <UNK> their parents not to have any more children having big families was at the time the play was written the cultural norm in the lds community and more importantly considered part of god's plan the church has since done a <UNK> and have made family planning a choice of the parents and large families are much less the cultural norm now making the entire <UNK> premise of the movie for a modern day mormon <UNK> br br <UNK> but it's really only as good as the music there are some catchy tunes here that just won't let this movie die the 1970's death it was pre destined for the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there <UNK> and the tough cool kids make new kids on the block look like <UNK> so cheers to all that gather the family around make some <UNK> o <UNK> and enjoy the show br br
<START> not totally off the wall in a good way but just totally stupid killer tongue is an uneasy mixture of sci fi horror and supposed comedy what this <UNK> to is a mindless and totally incoherent film there is very little dialog mainly due to the fact that the script if there was one is complete pond <UNK> i wouldn't even call it strange more like just total nonsense this movie is certain to disappoint and you have been warned there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this and if you do the <UNK> smell will <UNK> like rotten fish <UNK>
<START> pecker is a young unknown photographer from <UNK> who becomes a big star in the public the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all day life just as dirty underwear or human <UNK> it's a typical topic of john waters <UNK> based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the american way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative <UNK> by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown br br edward <UNK> of terminator 2 fame plays pecker supported by christina <UNK> photographer cindy <UNK> legendary patricia <UNK> and <UNK> long time actress <UNK> stole although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and can't compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of <UNK> brilliant serial mom it's still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former <UNK> girl who became a <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> from a <UNK> dish pecker is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene media <UNK> middle class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it recommended
<START> billy wilder is co credited for the story and his <UNK> touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of <UNK> <UNK> who both work for burnt out music legend oliver <UNK> the obvious <UNK> are gotten out of the way quite quickly thank heaven and what remains is a witty and <UNK> <UNK> with some fine songs and some more forgettable ones crosby at his most charming a great turn by broadway legend mary martin and basil <UNK> and oscar <UNK> providing most of the cynical <UNK> <UNK> is in rare form and his <UNK> haven't dated at all a delightful surprise and recommended for all fans of the genre
<START> this is a direct sequel to 'the <UNK> <UNK> 1940 because the lead character stephen <UNK> played by dick <UNK> is now thirty years older and is relating the story with the help of <UNK> footage to his son's fiancé there are only two unusual aspects to the film the early death of <UNK> and the presence of <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> as the mummy <UNK> gets top billing though given the nature of his role he has little more to do than limp along or <UNK> his arms about there's nothing scary about his presence except for his attempt to carry off the fiancé <UNK> <UNK> knox dick <UNK> gets second billing but he's killed off within the first fifteen minutes we'd have to wait until <UNK> 1960 when a lead character janet leigh dies way before the end of the movie <UNK> buddy from the first film babe <UNK> now <UNK> shows up a little later looking much much older and not doing any of the comic <UNK> he did in the original it's hard to believe it's the same actor unfortunately this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by <UNK> after only two brief scenes it's then left up to <UNK> son john played by bit player john <UNK> to led the chase to the cemetery no the sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to <UNK> house to burn it down and kill the mummy sound universally familiar br br <UNK> <UNK> is introduced to audiences as the new high priest <UNK> <UNK> to care for and feed <UNK> leaves to <UNK> with his <UNK> voice and appearance it's too bad he gets so easily killed a better movie would have had <UNK> take von <UNK> type charge of things in tracking down the mummy with a final <UNK> battle with him and <UNK> bay but instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous universal horror films put together by the hack <UNK> jay who wrote many of <UNK> other <UNK> although he also did <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> 1942 as well as <UNK> <UNK> of the coast <UNK> 1943 which also featured <UNK> knox br br <UNK> knox played anne <UNK> in six joe <UNK> movies 1946 1949 and of course <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> movie and tv credits is great in the title role of 'the amazing dr <UNK> 1948 br br the cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric with lots of <UNK> shadows in the <UNK> office than the first <UNK> mummy film but there's little else of interest or excitement br br i'll give it a 3
<START> when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye <UNK> which is no great surprise since it is perfect high school material and <UNK> to be the most staged musical in the world br br i was a music student and <UNK> strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately <UNK> the elvis references and <UNK> it up for a swinging 60s audience br br so when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his better known persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles <UNK> phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and innocent <UNK> br br but best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all <UNK> in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence of a stage br br so if you know the musical and few do not then check out this <UNK> it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be <UNK> which is good enough for me what is better than rendering a writer's work <UNK> and with colour and style
<START> i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie its got a pretty good plot some good action and the change of location for harry does not hurt either sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that eastwood is in good form as dirty harry and i liked pat <UNK> in this movie as the small town cop if you liked dirty harry then you should see this one its a lot better than the dead pool 4 5
<START> i rented zero day from the local video store last week i had never heard of the film and i had my <UNK> about it just from looking at the box i knew the film was an indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film br br i can tell you that after i finished watching zero day i immediately started it from the beginning again the film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at <UNK> high school of april of 1999 but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were my first time through watching this film i wasn't entirely sure if what i was watching were actual tapes left behind by the <UNK> at <UNK> in the back of my mind i knew what i was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake br br is the film disturbing absolutely are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film probably i think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters <UNK> and andre played by cal robertson and andre <UNK> why is that <UNK> for some people <UNK> and andre are planning a massacre at their high school i know for myself i felt an immense sadness for andre and <UNK> i had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point they had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped if only people around them had taken notice to their plight br br zero day is a phenomenal film it gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news it leaves you thinking about the lives involved and it leaves you <UNK> how people get to this point a week after seeing this film i still think about it br br those of you who have not seen zero day please keep in mind the following the film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on <UNK> the material in the film is disturbing this is not mainstream hollywood and there is no happy ending br br but if you can put all that aside zero day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little
<START> i think i've seen all of the <UNK> movies now and generally they're all very poor except for the <UNK> but this one is so bad it's unbelievable br br warning <UNK> br br it's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do he's a lawyer for <UNK> sake why when his children go missing does he not call the police oh yes it's because all the police hate lawyers so they're just ignore him and let him be attacked br br when he's arrested for murder they just let him go free he would be locked up in a cell <UNK> a <UNK> hearing br br why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home br br the police don't bother to try and find an escaped mental patient they don't bother to interview his daughter br br as for the ridiculous <UNK> br br in summary silly very unrealistic and a complete waste of time br br 0 10  one of the worst films ever made
<START> carlos <UNK> was excellent this is hour special he was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal i know people have said he's stolen material in this special but that is not true carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it not how anyone else wants it that is why he is so good people say he's not funny because he says dee dee dee too much and they still haven't realized thats part of his act and they don't want it that way but he brings it like that anyway and succeeds in making people laugh for all the <UNK> out there here is a message carlos is here to stay you have no point in trying to bring him down
<START> this movie was horrible simply put it was so bad i <UNK> with imdb to warn you of its dangers br br i am a campy horror film expert per se i have watched redneck zombies house of the psychotic women <UNK> party massacre ii and many others i know my schlock and i know this movie sucks br br three <UNK> of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other when they are not running they are <UNK> non <UNK> lines devoid of emotion or motivation when the actors begin to be acceptable the direction falls to pieces there were so many jarring low angle shots i figured <UNK> <UNK> had a 3 foot tall <UNK> he used what i call the <UNK> <UNK> several millions times that is <UNK> out from an object of interest like an amateur apparently the film crew couldn't get up early enough to film a sunrise so they filmed a sunset and played it in reverse with direction this lazy you are actually impressed with the final gory scene the only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first <UNK> five minutes br br if you want a good bad gory movie rent <UNK> oh or the <UNK> dead alive if you are a schlock buff and are looking for a challenge give darkness a go br br quote <UNK> the movie br br vampire it's die time
<START> les <UNK> the first movie about the medieval time <UNK> was actually funny i like jean reno as an actor but there was more there were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain <UNK> that would remind you a little bit of louis de <UNK> br br now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time <UNK> so they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting <UNK> as you advance in the movie the duke jean reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been <UNK> so there's not a lot he can do to save the film br br now the <UNK> slave <UNK> he has really all the attention the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy annoying stupid or whatever he was supposed to be fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer br br if you liked les <UNK> do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel if you didn't like les <UNK> you would never consider seeing the sequel if you liked this sequel well i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies
<START> i have to be honest and say i bought this movie not because of the content but because david <UNK> is in it i know shallow or what but come on mr <UNK> is a fantastic actor to put it mildly br br i really didn't know what to expect from watching this movie i'd read the other write up and those on other sites but i have to say i was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go david <UNK> as theo and <UNK> <UNK> as ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death the scene where theo finds out ryan is gay was played brilliantly he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without ryan <UNK> which of course he has br br the film has been very well <UNK> and is therefore incredibly sad moving uplifting and a celebration of life in parts i came away from this feeling sad at what ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and <UNK> love by the ex drug addict brother theo i agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where theo says he will be a father moving and i'd go a little further to say i actually <UNK> my thoughts at ryan when he <UNK> says to theo <UNK> makes you think you can be a <UNK> and theo says simply <UNK> ' theo walks away then but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self <UNK> aspect of ryan who is brought up <UNK> by the simple <UNK> br br a brilliantly conceived movie on all counts the acting directing writing etc are all so well done i can't really find anything else to say about this movie except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly to the <UNK> degree the respect for the subject matter and the <UNK> of love without being <UNK> and <UNK> speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today well done to all concerned br br not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general and also to be glad for all the things i have and not be sad for the things i don't but this movie did it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter
<START> <UNK> i got this movie because elizabeth <UNK> was in it i was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end other than that i was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time some teenager goes on a trip to romania with his dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there's a full moon he kills his father and friends about 30 years past but he doesn't age a bit and <UNK> in a high school there he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her this movie sucked and i don't recommend it to anyone read war and peace instead only ms <UNK> did a great job check out a very young bob <UNK> in this one
<START> what a surprising treat to come across on late television had i only read a brief plot <UNK> on a television listing before seeing the movie i would have passed the idea of a movie about a hit man seeing a shrink wanting to leave the business and falling in love sounds trite but the film works from the start of the movie it's clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders before he even says a word the look and feel of the film is perfect dark but not <UNK> so br br aside from the hit man family aspect which provides a touch of <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> with his marriage and his father's control macy shows a repressed sadness and his <UNK> talks with his young son are amazing the young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural personal and loving br br this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while and i can't believe i came across it by accident on late night television
<START> a lot has already been said on this movie and <UNK> d like to join those who praised it it's a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres drama comedy gangster film without making a mess of it at points you just laugh out loud at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch <UNK> genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie one is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street this sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three <UNK> very well it is erotic and funny at the same time another example of <UNK> genius is the part of the film where the <UNK> get tired first one of them the typical loser among the three guys <UNK> that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving all of the <UNK> get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again and at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other running in line just laughing so here is it all the beauty and the <UNK> of what we call life which <UNK> manages to show throughout the film his characters fail do they at the end but he doesn't rob them of their dignity monday and <UNK> blues that do justice to <UNK> claim that he is a genius go watch them br br
<START> i cannot stand this show has there ever been even one redeeming quality one funny punchline or one plot line that didn't make the average viewer want to <UNK> himself in a bowl of <UNK> <UNK> br br the voices oh those horrible wretched voices akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine <UNK> across a dusty <UNK> each character is uniquely annoying in his or her <UNK> for shrill <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sounds like a whining <UNK> <UNK> sounds like a stereotypical <UNK> and <UNK> dad makes every line sound like a bad <UNK> of a game show host guy <UNK> from <UNK> street comes to mind br br the animation is awful even the producers of <UNK> <UNK> oh laugh at the <UNK> bad artwork on this show every character has buck teeth or a square head or a head three <UNK> too big for his or her body and what's with having the characters speak every single line wide eyed and <UNK> as though posing for a photo <UNK> with the president then there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic not since the subtle grace of <UNK> <UNK> homer simpson and buddy <UNK> of charles in charge fame have characters been portrayed as so <UNK> dumb usually unrealistic is <UNK> with unfunny and that is most definitely the case here there hasn't been this much slapstick based on <UNK> since the naked gun 33 1 3 and at least leslie <UNK> was good at it br br finally the premise of the show and it's the same every single episode so big time spoiler alert here timmy wishes for something with his two fairly <UNK> something goes wrong there's always some contrived reason why he can't immediately reverse course and wish away the damage and then everything turns out just fine in the end oh and on a side note <UNK> parents never believe him when he complains about <UNK> and they continue to employ her at every opportunity maybe it's just me but it seems that a kids' show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably isn't a great idea br br if you're writing a paper and want to <UNK> an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen the fairly odd parents has to be a great place to start a prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it
<START> when i was a kid i remember watching this while visiting a friend of our uncle phil we're back a <UNK> story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called rex voiced by the wonderful john goodman he tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to earth to live he explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back along with some friends the doctor professor villain of this film i think might have been responsible for them being them back but i don't care about him the kids might like this but personally it is just too cheesy john goodman was probably the only decent thing poor
<START> yes this movie make me feel real horror when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it the bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho <UNK> actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting i'm always supporting independent movies when it deserves the support but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies i'm still traumatized i will not trust in any nice cover anymore
<START> a film destined to be on late night tv long after the present instant money makers have long been forgotten perhaps a little too subtle for today's youngsters but in time they'll grow into an appreciation of this movie
