<START> i think this could've been a decent movie and some of its parts are ok but in whole it's a b movie same about the plot parts are ok but it has several holes and <UNK> that doesn't quite add up acting is mostly ok i've seen worse of this too br br the beginning sets the level with cars driving in the desert making cool but totally unnecessary jumps through some small <UNK> in slow motion cool like the drivers had never seen sand before it gets slightly better from there but not much br br if you're gonna rent this get another one too and use this one as a warm up keep expectations low and it might work for you
<START> this was the modesty that we didn't know it was hinted at and <UNK> in the comic strip for the <UNK> to sell to <UNK> lee and janet <UNK> were true modesty blaise fans who were given the dream job tell a prequel story of modesty that the fans never saw before in their audio commentary they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run <UNK> the <UNK> should also note that we really don't know if everything she told <UNK> was true because she was <UNK> for time i didn't rent or borrow the dvd like other reviewers did i bought it and i don't want a <UNK> i watched it three times and i didn't sleep through it great dialog and well drawn characters that i cared about even bad guy <UNK> just like in the novels and comic <UNK> i too can't wait for the next modesty and willie film especially if this prequel is a sign of what's to come
<START> after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river why was kirk douglas replaced by brian <UNK> in the sequel it just wasn't the same without <UNK> and harrison as portrayed by douglas maybe he recognized how poor the plot was jim returns after extended absence to find jessica being pursued by another man he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him and not find competition for a disney movie this contains foul language plus the highly unnecessary part when jim jessica <UNK> up without being married very lame quite an insult to viewer intelligence according to members of my family i'll stick with the first one and try to forget i ever saw the sequel
<START> <UNK> turkish bath sequence in a film noir located in new york in the 50's that must be a hint at something something that curiously in all the previous comments no one has pointed out but seems to me essential to the understanding of this movie br br the turkish <UNK> sequence a back street at night the entrance of a sleazy <UNK> and <UNK> wrapped in a sheet getting his <UNK> <UNK> steve the <UNK> is of the young rough boxer <UNK> type and another guy a bodyguard finishes dressing up dixon obviously hates what he sees there and gets rough right away we know he has a reputation for <UNK> up suspects good cop but getting out of control easy why is it that he hates them so much br br could it be that he hates himself this part of himself he inherited from his father that dark side that could lead him right at the end of the sidewalk into the <UNK> what if that dark side <UNK> within a closet remember whenever dixon meets <UNK> 3 times the guy is lying on a bed and he only has men around him for company the irony of the girls poster <UNK> up on the wall near his bed br br <UNK> acts funny affected manners <UNK> his neck <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> into his <UNK> each time he talks to dixon dixon with a vengeance is bent on <UNK> down <UNK> who seems not to understand i never saw a man so full of hate as you i consider it almost humorous the way you came after me alone four years jumping at me as if i was somebody special why br br because <UNK> is someone special indeed he is the direct <UNK> of <UNK> father your father liked me your father set me up in business he stands as <UNK> criminal brother his dark side <UNK> and to top it all he prefers the company of men dixon knows it well who killed him <UNK> you or one of your <UNK> <UNK> notice how each time they meet dixon <UNK> <UNK> he picks the address book out of his jacket <UNK> his face punches him <UNK> i warn you not to touch me <UNK> <UNK> is obvious or put it different his <UNK> homosexuality dixon aka <UNK> kid is the son of a thief in reaction to this he decided to become a cop a good one but there is something of the criminal in him a dark side he is a violent <UNK> a murderer a liar besides he is not married brings a <UNK> blonde to his familiar eat out place every now and then but nothing else the waitress <UNK> says that he doesn't know how to make love to a woman dixon has a deep feeling of guilt and hates himself for those reasons a hood and a mobster like his old man blood will tell finally in order to achieve redemption dixon decides to sacrifice himself if he gets his alter ego <UNK> to kill him he will free himself from the guilt and free the girl and her father too br br the end of the movie brings us back to the opening sequence <UNK> is pushed in the <UNK> and dixon deserves the right to walk the sidewalk and wins the love of the dame he is straight at last br br the <UNK> theme of the movie could very well be that of a man who in order to cover his repressed feelings wants to experience a woman's love jean <UNK> br br these notes owe a lot to the film commentary by jean <UNK> in the french dvd edited by <UNK>
<START> warning contains many spoilers br br let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian <UNK> incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for <UNK> to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof br br the premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thought provoking themes in there but it ended up like a <UNK> <UNK> it <UNK> why i hate 99 of british cinema it feels too long it's tedious for the most part and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes just when you think there's a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like paula <UNK> running a marathon with little imaginative directing and a <UNK> plot there isn't much to keep the audience from <UNK> off into their popcorn as for the script i can only <UNK> that the writer was trying to save a few trees with the average scene reading something along the lines of alice f off adam stares adam runs off into woods alice follows alice adam adam i suspect that word for word the actors probably got paid more than kate moss did for her virgin mobile <UNK> what few lines there were didn't have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f word that would make bridget <UNK> friend <UNK> proud there is little establishment of the main characters before the main <UNK> event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic <UNK> that's <UNK> reaction br br alice isn't the kind of woman who <UNK> sympathy either she's got a great job an expensive london apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as <UNK> bitter and <UNK> before her life takes a turn for the worst after the attack a few layers are <UNK> back which sort of explain why she is this way to start with she grew up with a tough as old boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so instead of following in his footsteps she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living instead she found a group of stereotypical middle class <UNK> who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a <UNK> and the <UNK> that come with an integrated security entertainment system i e becoming mrs robinson to a wanna be cockney wide boy <UNK> someone pass me a <UNK> the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson in the hands of a lesser actress she would've been <UNK> one dimensional but ms anderson actually manages to <UNK> a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being most notably when she's sincerely <UNK> for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her <UNK> from continuing their assault br br i can't say that adam <UNK> much better either danny <UNK> played him well as a fish out of water jack the <UNK> but a good performance couldn't save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background br br this film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too <UNK> from beginning to end as for the shock the most shocking thing about this film is the <UNK> <UNK> of how painfully thin ms anderson has become it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes on a side note only in a british film would a gang of violent sex <UNK> take the time to offer each other <UNK> before continuing to cheer their mates on talk about stiff upper lip taken to the extreme if this is the kind of film that the national <UNK> is <UNK> money to make then i'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week br br saying that i hated this film is giving it too much credit i didn't care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion i want that one and a bit hours of my life back please
<START> this one took me by surprise because i had often been disappointed by adrian <UNK> in the past but he caught the perfect balance in this performance avoiding both farce and pathos while delivering humour and real emotions the always wonderful julie waters is terrific here and anyone who has not yet scene her in <UNK> <UNK> rita should rent it immediately marvelous film the rest of the supporting characters are well played as well many <UNK> eccentric without going over the top this one is fun
<START> this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around all the characters are wonderful and the story is just brilliant plus jodie foster and <UNK> <UNK> are simply amazing in this the ending is very powerful however i won't spoil it for you and i thought the character development was top notch plus you can really relate to all of the characters especially <UNK> and annie as you will be rooting for them plus i loved how it moved slowly and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about i can't believe this only has a 5 9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion and it was funny seeing randy quaid in this type of role plus this is extremely well written and made as well one scene that really got to me was when <UNK> marilyn <UNK> is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party and the film has many surprising moments as well plus the dialog is especially excellent this is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion its thought provoking funny and sad with amazing performances all around and i say go see it immediately your bound to love it the direction is fantastic adrian <UNK> does a fantastic job here with awesome camera work and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace the acting is amazing jodie foster is really cute and is amazing as always she was extremely likable caring had a lovable character was intense in some scenes was focused and she and <UNK> <UNK> were the heart of the film as <UNK> and annie foster rules <UNK> <UNK> is way hot and is amazing here i really felt sorry for her character as she had a very likable character that just needed help she gives a powerful performance and created a very memorable character she was amazing scott <UNK> is great as brad he was really likable and did his job well i liked him randy quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him sally <UNK> is great as the mother i liked her a lot marilyn <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are both very good as <UNK> and <UNK> and did what they had to do well as the other two friends laura dern has a very early role here as it was cool to see her not much of a part though rest of the cast do fine overall go see it immediately it's an underrated masterpiece out of 5
<START> fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by david f <UNK> the lead actress <UNK> walker is well cast and strangely attractive she resembles a deranged <UNK> <UNK> with a bad hair do this chick only made two of these films and then moved back to texas the music is terrible one of her boyfriends is played by sam <UNK> from the tv show the <UNK> using a different name br br best line in the film from tony are you putting me on doll none of my chicks put me on good b w cinematography from <UNK> <UNK> easy rider targets many others good locales cool swimming pool also used in the <UNK> strange ending but fitting a 4 out of 10 best performance <UNK> walker
<START> this installment very much makes the cia look like a very foolish organization in reality perhaps they are after all the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to <UNK> killing everyone including his own people in order to kill jason bourne br br matt damon does a very credible job as bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film he is still trying to remember who he was how he has gotten where he is he gets help from a couple of folks it seems like every minute of the film somebody is trying to kill him br br there is little time for rest in this film the action sequences seem very very real there are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky <UNK> which in a way add to the realism make it seem less hollywood than many pictures these sequences add realism to the film in feeling br br the suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if bourne can head them off this is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained i am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series
<START> i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the <UNK> for a <UNK> that was well written thank you peter <UNK> and because when steve carell stars in the film you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding dan in real life delivered that promise br br the film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss with steve carell and the wondrous juliette <UNK> their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their <UNK> the cast sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead
<START> this is a very rare example of a movie about <UNK> of <UNK> the film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of <UNK> at all will strongly sympathize with its main character adrian <UNK> is very believable as <UNK> <UNK> and shall not be forgot for this <UNK> acting the directing of christopher <UNK> is very <UNK> treating such a difficult issue quite excellently packed into a good story not a big movie neither an art film but a little lovely motion picture
<START> kurt thomas in one of the series of <UNK> olympic stars turned movie stars movies that mercifully only includes one other mitch <UNK> in american <UNK> at least that one had janet jones this one has um a <UNK> using his martial arts and his <UNK> skills to save a european country from <UNK> sure it could happen on a scale of one to ten a 0
<START> the cast was good and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd whom i like from previous movies the movie was a great family movie nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids a good story line lots of laughs lighthearted and enjoyable if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill kid pleasing and not difficult for a parent to watch either
<START> a delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way cinema after all is a visual media and <UNK> used its full potential a young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind in one of the <UNK> he meets with a girl words are not <UNK> but their <UNK> <UNK> are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations the two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words
<START> isn't anyone else tired of that old <UNK> where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film gives us some <UNK> and then <UNK> his head off for no apparent reason i know i am br br the sad thing is that it's use in this film is worthless if you have seen the first film the first remake i should say then the information given is completely worthless because you would have already known it i guess you can that it isn't worthless to the main characters but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head wouldn't he want to live sure he would have died anyway br br this is the second film to be titled the hills have eyes ii the first being the sequel to the original 70's film this is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me see i'm probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a <UNK> to begin with much less an original <UNK> and now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original <UNK> it just makes it worse but anyways br br wes craven's original hills have eyes was decent in the end though the idea was better than the presentation but he most likely had a low budget to be quite honest wes craven isn't that good of a horror director he's only made a few good horror movies nightmare on elm st new nightmare a few alright ones scream and a bunch of horrible ones cursed shocker vampire in brooklyn oh yeah and he made swamp thing as well but the original <UNK> falls under the latter category i've only seen a few minutes but it was terrible br br now he has co written the new <UNK> and it's such a disappointment last year's <UNK> remake was even better than the original film it was tense i guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers it made us feel dirty for the first hour we were in hell and finally in the last few moments the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good br br this new film has no tension no suspense whatsoever just violent things happening to mostly stupid people there is hardly any menacing presence here just ugly <UNK> hiding under rocks br br i'm getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making it was just the other day that i watching deep blue sea where samuel l jackson kept on walking around the water while giving the speech and then he gets eaten by a shark only because the idiot stayed to close to the water something that nobody would do in the given situation here is the exact same thing people go off by themselves to take a <UNK> even though they know people are dying seriously couldn't a <UNK> break wait and then when you think people would have learned someone else goes of by themselves seriously isn't more scary when the characters are bringing their a game and still losing i would think so br br it even under delivers it should have made the first remake look like the fog remake which was less menacing than an episode of <UNK> more bad guys more time in the <UNK> more tension more of everything br br but it actually <UNK> less bad guys no tension sure we have more time in the <UNK> but not a whole lot happens there in the end it only seems like there is two or three bad guys the last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people where is this tribe who keeps on watching them through <UNK> seriously these are the things this film should have brought us but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us with that exact same being watched scene come on i'll give the devil it's due the look of the film is good but thats it br br i don't even think fans of gore will like this though i'm probably wrong there is gore though most of it is <UNK> up while in the dark but without the tension and characters you even care about the gore does nothing in my book in the end you're not frightened you re not shocked unless you're an 8 year old girl you don't even feel like you have seen anything new
<START> this is a fantastic series first and foremost it is very well done and very interesting as a huge wwii buff i had learned a lot before seeing this series one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds <UNK> speaking that is it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper <UNK> of what was happening then one of the best parts is the <UNK> by sir laurence oliver i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii but really think only the die <UNK> such as myself will want to buy this or watch it more than once my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the <UNK> overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii <UNK> professional or personal alike
<START> i bought this while i was playing chess in <UNK> i am from <UNK> though it is very good definitely with an understanding of the horror genre the monster towards the end is very scary people who <UNK> this on imdb should recall that it was a huge <UNK> among serious horror critics br br
<START> this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom <UNK> who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller <UNK> is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci fi channel i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10
<START> the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940's humour it <UNK> world war two into the plot but not as much as i initially believed it would and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly well <UNK> playing the role of tommy <UNK> is what <UNK> the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or dragging br br the story of the haunted station is actually spooky even for present day standards it is unique and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to <UNK> up the mystery which is the ghost train <UNK> is basically a <UNK> to all the other members while the rest get along fairly well he is always centre of attention and can be dubbed as being annoying but that is by those who do not appreciate 1940's humour his humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch br br if it was not for <UNK> <UNK> than this film would of been shorter in action enjoyment and the result would be not as effective in my opinion
<START> a <UNK> at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal <UNK> faced <UNK> zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage a <UNK> handful of <UNK> folks do their best to survive this <UNK> ordeal director co writer producer todd sheets displays an <UNK> sincere love and passion for go straight for the throat lively and gruesome horror fare he maintains an <UNK> snappy pace throughout fills the screen with wall to wall crazy action and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum moreover sheets certainly doesn't <UNK> on the <UNK> graphic and excessive over the top splatter this picture delivers a tasty <UNK> of flesh melting <UNK> lots of gut <UNK> one dude has his heart <UNK> out and there's even a nice <UNK> on a tree branch sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end for example almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie <UNK> granted this flick has its fair share of flaws the <UNK> editing several ham <UNK> attempts at pathos and the largely awful acting from a rank no name cast all leave a good deal to be desired top <UNK> <UNK> go to the pretty and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for her <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of the <UNK> daria <UNK> frank <UNK> likewise does well as rugged take charge army veteran ralph walsh best of all <UNK> sure grasp of an <UNK> <UNK> sense of <UNK> <UNK> momentum and obvious <UNK> for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish
<START> im really addicted to caprica because it's a really good prequel series to battlestar galactica it really has a slow pace start but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air br br i have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season br br this sci fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres br br eric <UNK> does an amazing job as well as polly walker as <UNK> <UNK> br br totally worth checking out br br catch caprica on <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> central on <UNK>
<START> this is the movie that i use to judge all other bad movies and so far there hasn't been anything close br br the only good thing i can say is that after watching this i know that i have seen the worst movie i will ever see
<START> this movie has made me want to become a director and michelle rodriguez is brilliant how the hell wasn't she on <UNK> top 25 under 25 she beats them all this film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance best film i have ever seen
<START> the broadway musical a chorus line is arguably the best musical in theatre it's about the experiences of people who live for dance the <UNK> they experience and the sacrifices they make each dancer is <UNK> for parts in a broadway chorus line yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a <UNK> br br the film version though captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance whatsoever br br the biggest mistake was made in giving the director's job to sir richard attenborough whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for gandhi why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly <UNK> place br br which brings us to the next problem a chorus line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes it's the least flashy of broadway musicals and its simplicity was its glory however that doesn't translate well to film and no one really thought that it would for that reason the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers and should have left the theatre and audition process the singers could have offered their songs in other <UNK> and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet jazz or tap class heck they could have <UNK> down broadway in their lively <UNK> yet not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film as <UNK> complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his <UNK> direction br br many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director michael douglas whether he wants to hear them or not <UNK> character is <UNK> about choosing to whom he <UNK> a sympathetic ear and to whom he has no patience br br while the filmmakers <UNK> to be true to the nature of the play some <UNK> changes were made the very beautiful hello twelve hello thirteen hello love a <UNK> stage number which took the dancers back to their <UNK> was removed and replaced with the dreadful surprise a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar adding insult to injury surprise simply <UNK> the same story as hello love but without the wit or pathos br br there is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when <UNK> a broadway show to film if you want to see a film version of this show the next closest thing is bob <UNK> brilliant all that jazz while <UNK> daughter is in a chorus line he is the <UNK> who should have been involved as director he would have known what to do with this material which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort
<START> one of director miike <UNK> very best it's so good it's difficult to put into words at nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to end br br it recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that unlike today those films weren't afraid to scare there's a lot of nasty detail here that i initially found jarring but soon realised it's nothing different to what i grew up on the film is a <UNK> of '80s kid's films conventions you name it it's there a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy dysfunctional world into another inhabited by mythical and mystical <UNK> a quest to save both worlds from an evil force a beautiful heroine he has a crush on a sadistic <UNK> go go <UNK> from kill bill <UNK> 1 a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to but all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depth br br one of the imdb reviews begins where was this film when i was a kid and it's a sentiment i agree with <UNK> even while watching it i <UNK> the fact that i hadn't grown up on it that it wasn't a part of my childhood like <UNK> masters of the universe and to a much lesser extent the <UNK> story those films and others like the <UNK> are <UNK> but never copied miike relentlessly offering us a new take on things br br poor cgi is a <UNK> of many of his films sometimes due to <UNK> limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice a desire to present things in an outlandish way here the cgi is mostly average solely due to <UNK> limitations but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle the cg effects combine with traditional puppets <UNK> and truly extraordinary make up to create a world filled with rich characters and characterisation that frequently borders on the <UNK> br br this ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made not for younger or more sensitive kids though br br just jaw <UNK> wonderful see it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle appreciate it then show it to them let them grow up on the great yokai war as some small <UNK> for the fact you couldn't
<START> belushi at his most <UNK> and <UNK> cox before friends has a small role i often think belushi is under used in hollywood and this film role is one of his best for those of you who watch his tv show this is a very different and likable character the movie itself is not earth shattering nor is the message new but rather it is sweet and endearing the supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is a perfect balance although <UNK> whining can get tiresome and michael <UNK> charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister if not well meaning edge hamilton as <UNK> wife is unfortunately two dimensional and one wonders why he married her in addition <UNK> russo is wasted and not terribly convincing at the prom queen who got away nevertheless a nice way to spend two hours
<START> i thought hedy <UNK> who managed to escape from the <UNK> grave of part one was going to be in part 2 guess not i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the 13th part 2 you know what i mean br br this movie like scream 3 and urban legend 2 followed movies within a movie br br this was pure crap the whole movie within a movie crap br br bad stay away
<START> as a <UNK> catholic who had 11 years of catholic school but hasn't been to mass in 35 years except for <UNK> and <UNK> i thought i'd get a kick out of this and i did for the first two thirds of the movie it was all the standard stuff strict <UNK> school <UNK> repressed sexuality etc but then suddenly the movie turned mean really mean now mind you i saw this before the <UNK> <UNK> hit and maybe i wouldn't have been quite so offended at such nasty hateful <UNK> at the catholic church if i'd known about those <UNK> such a catholic term and <UNK> br br it's been a few years since i rented the video and i won't go back to rent it again with a new perspective it just left such a dirty nasty ugly taste in my mouth i wonder what experience all the actors had with the church because either they really hate it or they <UNK> themselves for the paycheck it's an incredibly anti catholic movie offensive to anyone who has a <UNK> of a <UNK> of respect for catholic education which i still do because there were no better teachers back in the <UNK> whatever else those nuns did they forced me to learn how to read and write the english language they made us <UNK> how many kids today can do simple <UNK> in their heads truth is there's nothing more essential for success in america can ya read can ya add <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> great you can get any advanced degree you want and the discipline of catholic education will stand you in good <UNK> not just as you continue your studies but also for the rest of your life no matter what you think of the catholic mythology we all had to learn br br such a great cast such a lousy rotten script i really feel bad and no it's not badly trust me the nuns taught me better for the writer and director br br i thought i had mixed emotions about catholic school but the participants in this project must've been those bad ie e stupid kids who sat in the back of the room if they were willingly involved in making this movie
<START> i love the <UNK> my son has been watching them for over a year we went to the <UNK> concert last year as well as one concert yesterday <UNK> he loves them the <UNK> do not teach the <UNK> or numbers but who cares are you being serious the tv isn't suppose to teach your children about numbers or the <UNK> the parents should get over it the <UNK> actually can sing <UNK> has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do not lip sing imagine they dance jump around and still sing they have talent the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show this show is by far the best show on tv for kids and a rock band for children how amazing is that why are people saying <UNK> rooney is gay where did you hear that from whether he is or not he is awesome leave him alone its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children
<START> this movie has wild bill <UNK> <UNK> jane buffalo bill and general <UNK> all together gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays <UNK> jane and charles <UNK> plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him this was the first time cecil b demille and gary cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time this movie starts out with <UNK> assassination and it also deals with an indian war <UNK> jane is in love with wild bill and buffalo bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home this movie also deals with <UNK> last stand and is far from accurate gary cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like jean arthur but i liked her here
<START> i watched the entire movie <UNK> the participation of william hurt <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i'm glad that i had no idea of the presence of peter <UNK> at the end of the movie i said that was peter <UNK> kudos to mr <UNK> for an outstanding performance <UNK> played a major character and his performance was such that i didn't even recognize him br br overall the plot was bad the writing was bad and the performances aside from those of <UNK> and <UNK> were <UNK> the scenery and setting were interesting and <UNK> was amazing br br 4 stars of a possible 10
<START> this movie had all the elements to be a smart <UNK> comedy but for some reason it took the <UNK> route perhaps it didn't really know who its audience was but it's hardly a man's movie given the cast and plot yet is too slapstick and dumb blonde to appeal fully to women br br if you have seen <UNK> blonde and its sequel then this is like the <UNK> awful sequel great actors such as luke wilson should expect better material jessica simpson could also have managed so much more <UNK> leigh cook and penelope anne miller <UNK> in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing br br many things in this movie were paint by numbers the various uber cliché montages the last minute <UNK> even the kids' party chaos this just suggests lazy <UNK> br br it should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you don't take it seriously but it's such a glaring could do better than you'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past
<START> whoever said that horror wasn't an educational film genre huh thanks to this marvelous hammer short movie i now at least know never to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house because he might just be <UNK> and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts mind forever thank you hammer the <UNK> episode in the house of horror series is another one i've been looking forward to seeing mainly because the guy in the director's chair was don sharp one of <UNK> finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated sharp was responsible for some very cool hammer films like kiss of the vampire and <UNK> the mad monk as well as some overlooked independent productions like dark places and <UNK> his contribution to house of horror is easily one of the best in the series with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes the plot centers on two <UNK> dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror but it's actually an ancient <UNK> device that can be used to <UNK> <UNK> the demonic guardian of the <UNK> the mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their <UNK> but michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device when he picks up a clearly <UNK> girl who's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy satanic <UNK> and the <UNK> sacrifice of young women are typical british horror topics but david <UNK> screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot <UNK> among which a highly inventive climax there's also plenty of tension to admire the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid especially john carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie recommended
<START> dog bite dog isn't going to be for everyone but i really enjoyed it full of <UNK> stabbing and shooting but don't worry  the <UNK> a terrible shot it can best be described as a violent romp through hong kong and cambodia edison <UNK> plays <UNK> a <UNK> assassin in town to kill a <UNK> despite being filthy from his journey he's almost immediately <UNK> at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant if this sounds wildly implausible to you you should probably avoid this film it acted as my cue to suspend disbelief and i had a lot more fun for it br br chasing <UNK> down is <UNK> sam lee a young edgy cop who likes to <UNK> people around almost as much as he likes to smoke <UNK> walks a fine line that has internal affairs investigating him and his father a legendary good cop is in a coma following a drug deal that went south the <UNK> is that <UNK> is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt <UNK> br br there are a car crashes lots of killings and a strange and awkward love story on offer here all played out in almost comic book style i suspect the humour was deliberate nobody uses <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> without an eye for the <UNK> absurd though the over the top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members there are at least three points where the film might have ended and at <UNK> mins it may have <UNK> from more ruthless editing or the <UNK> of one of the narrative threads the light hearted stuff worked well so i would have left out the interactions with the three fathers br br i'm inclined to give it a high pass however if only because of the ending  i've rarely heard so many people laugh so <UNK> at what should have been a poignant moment this is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
<START> the egyptian movies has a lot of <UNK> with high level of drama or romance or comedy or action even sports <UNK> la <UNK> al <UNK> was banned in egypt because it content nudity full frontal female nudity and this kind of nudity is <UNK> in the egyptian movies when i saw this movies i felt down fool story nude actress bad action some horror awful colors dear friend if you wanna see a great egyptian movie simply stay away form <UNK> la <UNK> al <UNK> we have great movies in egypt we have a great actors who won a global wins like omar el sheriff or <UNK> <UNK> we have great directors like <UNK> <UNK> so believe me <UNK> you don't need to see this movie
<START> don't get me wrong i assumed this movie would be stupid i honestly did i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going different story for a different time as i began watching i noticed something this film was terrible now there are two types of terrible there's freddy vs jason terrible where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is and then there is a movie like this the cat in the hat failed to create even a <UNK> interest in me as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless but i felt as though i had in some way been <UNK> by the <UNK> of said movie mike myers is usually brilliant i love the majority of his work but something in this movie didn't click one of the things that the director producers writers <UNK> changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book red black white on any character but the cat <UNK> or not they also refused to capture any of the original and i hate to use this word but it fits <UNK> of the original the book was like an ice cream sunday colorful and delicious and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as <UNK> br br avoid this like a <UNK> prostitute
<START> well first off i'd like to add that i myself is somewhat of a <UNK> so what i look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts but this is however not the case here sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it isn't entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying hitler wasn't anti <UNK> in his youth he even worked for jews before world war one it was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the jews his upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate hitler as a child wasn't a disturbed little brat he had a more or less normal upbringing nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is hitler br br robert <UNK> is a great actor but he doesn't really fit in the role as hitler hitler wasn't as impossible and unstable as he is portrait ed here under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom manipulated people through his charms his unstable behavior and rage <UNK> started in the turning point of the war br br i'd like to see a film about hitler's life that is based upon real historical facts and not <UNK> i really hate when people point a <UNK> finger at for example hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil it is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like the ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this because it seems as if they didn't even know what really happened hitler wasn't even shot in the revolutionary march in <UNK> his shoulder was ripped out of its <UNK> br br it gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this
<START> unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by <UNK> br br for a short film the cinematography costumes sets sound editing and everything else is very very good this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals so the quality is to be expected the problem as usual <UNK> in the story itself br br thing is it's not really a story to tell a story or in <UNK> case show a story you need plot and conflict you need things that happen to the protagonist events these events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason he can't get it tim watcher has no problems or goals he's a kind of supernatural <UNK> who <UNK> mankind that's it so what we have here is pure exposition instead of being shown a story we're simply learning things about this tim watcher individual of course considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film's short duration it's hard to give enough background about him so the movie <UNK> to voice over narration in this case it's used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we'd never <UNK> in fact if it wasn't for the <UNK> we'd think the character was just a <UNK> old man going around looking at things to make it worse the <UNK> also explains what's happening on the screen the images we're shown are just decoration for the text we're listening to br br i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something but because the images don't stand on their own it's impossible to say that what's left obviously has value as a measure of the <UNK> technical <UNK> not incredible but good but fails to entertain <UNK> thrill or at the very least show a story
<START> <UNK> 6 <UNK> is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80's horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script two <UNK> journalist of a <UNK> <UNK> newspaper are sent very much against their will to <UNK> to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist frankenstein there are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film like a little <UNK> for hard boiled eggs and laboratory test <UNK> that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table the wholesome of the film however is not as successful as it could and should have been with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong the roger corman production <UNK> twist which came out four years after this is a lot funnier and much more recommended the film is particularly <UNK> the classic universal <UNK> of the early 30's so you better make sure you've seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references there's a pretty original twist <UNK> that the frankenstein character only behaves like a mad raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory it's also revealed that he's actually more of a father <UNK> sort of <UNK> who's only concerned with the condition of <UNK> monsters michael richards the freaky guy who plays kramer in seinfeld stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments i'm pretty sure john <UNK> character in mr deeds was inspired by <UNK> role here
<START> i saw this film at the international film festival of <UNK> i also met the director of the film i heard that ed wood wrote the story in 10 years i'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece his triumph br br well if you take the film seriously like mr wood did it is really one of the worst films you will ever see and this is cool the big joke of i woke up early the day i died is that it doesn't even try to be a decent film br br this makes the film very very good the script is filled with <UNK> and <UNK> a lot of black humour billy <UNK> role is absolutely excellent you see this is either high art or low rubbish br br
<START> <UNK> ii is a good sequel but not quite as good as the first one this series don't seem to be quite as serious as the first one there are much more comedy in this good one though br br we're back at the danish <UNK> the danish national hospital mrs <UNK> is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done but fate <UNK> it otherwise she is soon chasing ghosts and <UNK> is doing everyone mad and it's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdom br br this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous by all means lot of fun but it makes you take the series a little less serious the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones it's well written but some of the new elements are just kind of silly but they save it by making it more like a comedy good story but not as good original and thrilling as the first series br br the actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast they are all very good it's an odd story and setting some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job yet these actors handle this whole situation perfectly br br much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact the cinematography is one of those qualities the hand held camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities good movement great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch br br be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first also be prepared to see some more i didn't think that green thing looked all too good thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit never the less the effects like the ghosts are really good the non digital effects looks good too little brother looks just really odd but you accept it all over i'd say effects are from ok to good br br the music is also quite good moody and nice some of it are really touching it fits really nice as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well br br all together this makes a good sequel if you'd seen <UNK> you can see this one without being disappointed it has many of the same qualities as the first series however i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this these two makes up a series you don't wanna miss
<START> why should you watch this there are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it superbly and <UNK> directed by albert and david <UNK> grey gardens was originally intended to be a film on the <UNK> of east <UNK> but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two edith <UNK> <UNK> the aunt and cousin of <UNK> kennedy <UNK> their life was certainly an amusing one edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas edie performing <UNK> and <UNK> dances with their many cats one was named ted z kennedy the film is interesting because it is both funny and sad edith died shortly after the film was released in <UNK> 1977 aged <UNK> after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the film she <UNK> and sang in a nightclub edie <UNK> jr was born in <UNK> and is still living in miami beach this film is both engaging and <UNK>
<START> clever gritty witty fast paced sexy <UNK> sleazy erotic heartfelt and corny <UNK> parade is a first class entertainment what the movies are all about br br the realistic satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking to think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today especially considering that realism has taken over and <UNK> contemporary cinema br br this film was made at a time when the hayes code <UNK> content was being ignored and the result is a fresh self <UNK> critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age i'd recommend watching any film from this period that is 1930 <UNK> for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be
<START> action horror sci fi exploitation director fred <UNK> ray shows he has some talent as a director character actor william smith is one of the best tough bad guys in the industry he treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career as for randy travis he gives his best lee van <UNK> impression he's not bad in the film smith and travis make the movie as for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out ray did a great job directing this flick smith and travis were good i'd give this b western on a scale of one to ten ten being the best a seven
<START> castle in the sky is undoubtedly a <UNK> miyazaki film after seeing it for the first time i'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint on the contrary you get your <UNK> worth which means as to what miyazaki's films are concern that is nothing less than excellent br br produced early in his cinematic career castle in the sky <UNK> many of the trade marks in his later movies with strong but young female characters forced to grow up due to <UNK> circumstances helped out by very interesting and some times lovable supporting characters and of course the usual battle of nature versus civilization flying machines lots of it beautiful painted <UNK>  but alas no pigs at least that i've noticed after all i have only seen it once never the less miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier with <UNK> which was a dress rehearsal for princess <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> castle in the sky is set a bit a part from these two with a soft action packed first 30 minutes resembling his tv series conan and his directed episodes of <UNK> holmes in here we are introduced to <UNK> a girl who literally falls from the sky only to be found by <UNK> a young boy working in a little countryside mining town intrigued by her <UNK> and <UNK> a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of laputa <UNK> is set on helping her find out where she came from whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates as the movie progresses the plot gets <UNK> and much more interesting revealing <UNK> at his best br br the sound track is very reminiscent of spirited away or vice versa as castle in the sky was produced first and much like its director joe <UNK> the composer starts with a very light score that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward br br a note to the english dubbing with a good interpretation from the two lead stars although anna <UNK> <UNK> has a very thick accent which the actress still had at that point in her career and a heads up for mark <UNK> as <UNK> making up for a <UNK> yet <UNK> villain br br don't miss this one people
<START> i find it heart warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom american <UNK> and howard the duck would begin their career with a low budget exploitation horror film like this perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn <UNK> <UNK> and gloria <UNK> an oscar nomination later in their respective careers <UNK> of evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't <UNK> the film making <UNK> to pull it off br br the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small <UNK> town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back it doesn't take long for the <UNK> narrative to abandon all hope and dive <UNK> in disjointed absurdity and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe <UNK> of evil needs to be <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> of 70's exploitation as an example of <UNK> mystery horror br br the surreal non <UNK> keep <UNK> on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and half mad alcoholic played by the great elisha cook jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley <UNK> by <UNK> a little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded murderous <UNK> eating <UNK> br br part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain basement artsy <UNK> that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator with <UNK> of evil the boundaries between the <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough wrap <UNK> <UNK> hopelessly br br take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug <UNK> <UNK> stream of consciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary br br while we're still talking about a <UNK> <UNK> picture <UNK> of evil is different and only loosely one at least with current <UNK> of what a zombie movie is supposed to be the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse <UNK> upon the town by a mysterious <UNK> <UNK> who came from the woods one day in the meantime <UNK> finds time for snippets of mass <UNK> criticism in a flesh eating supermarket scene that <UNK> dawn of the dead by a good number of years you can hear the mst3k line already <UNK> is dead only his <UNK> food <UNK> <UNK> and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater br br i generally think that the surreal works in careful well <UNK> doses how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal <UNK> seems to just <UNK> it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously <UNK> his hand when the <UNK> for example picks up a girl <UNK> her way to town and eats a <UNK> in front of her you can almost imagine the director <UNK> <UNK> at the audience amused and satisfied with his own <UNK> br br the general film making level is also pretty low after the half way mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either add to that the choppy editing average acting and <UNK> general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of <UNK> town are criminally <UNK> and i'd file <UNK> under <UNK> <UNK> but still <UNK> <UNK> will find enough to appreciate even though it's not particularly gory trashy or sleazy
<START> <UNK> reynolds seems a might grown up for the role of <UNK> a boy crazy sixteen year old in small town america who <UNK> her steady guy for a visiting soldier and winds up on the cover of life magazine <UNK> at a <UNK> party all in the same week non stop <UNK> of <UNK> put downs bull talk and unfunny bits of business such as <UNK> little sister <UNK> family members <UNK> <UNK> as the maid constantly <UNK> after sassy kid <UNK> <UNK> mother involved with the red cross and <UNK> father trying to write an <UNK> on the problems with today's teenagers as the parents <UNK> <UNK> edward arnold and <UNK> <UNK> ann <UNK> make an unlikely couple even for 1944 he looks incapable of helping to <UNK> a child much less raising two of them nominated for an academy award for owen <UNK> editing warner bros followed this in 1946 with <UNK> gets married reynolds must have <UNK> her co <UNK> by then she was replaced by joan leslie 1 2 from
<START> letting the class watch this in english was a bad idea films that are serious and more educational can have an effect but it appears this one didn't have any effect whatsoever on the class whenever the teacher left conversations quickly started and i didn't hear the words shakespeare or <UNK> being used at all and when you look at this it is easy to see why the acting is nothing special everyone seems bored to bits just reading from the page without a care in the world shakespeare always did prefer <UNK> dialogue to action and death but i just couldn't understand a word anyone was saying the costumes aren't too bad and neither are the special effects the class may not have loved the film but they weren't exactly taking the p ss either but it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy the scenes on the ship at the start of the film weren't too badly done though the rain looked a bit unrealistic everything else was done well and good but where were the severed heads and exploding <UNK> where was the death where was the inspiration the character of ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes but as all was on show he was just another excuse for a joke this film is not in any way appealing to either sex the women and girls won't have any romance or comedy to enjoy and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off the <UNK> wasn't badly done but this felt like something the producers had to make not something they wanted to make and the general boredom and lack of inspiration show 3 10
<START> except for jon <UNK> this guy <UNK> the entire movie br br the plot sounded entertaining a <UNK> year old <UNK> son <UNK> still lives with widowed mom keaton who happens to meet a new love daniels <UNK> son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to <UNK> the relationship he also meets a girl <UNK> br br i really liked the performance of daniels and especially <UNK> but whoever casted <UNK> would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach <UNK> performance is annoying which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you're upset about the end in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me
<START> i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second br br i found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was <UNK> on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening br br i found that there were so many perfect choices made the casting the script the little bits of humor <UNK> in it there were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately and for the last number of years
<START> i just saw this film i first saw it when i was 7 and could just about remember the end so i watched it like 10 minutes ago and i may seem like a baby as i am 12 ha ha i started to cry at the ending i forgotten how sad it was i think i was mainly sad for anne marie because she said 'i love you <UNK> and also <UNK> miss you <UNK> just made me really cry ha ha it has to be one of me favourite movies of all time it is just a film well worth watching watch it ha ha thats all i can say <UNK> br br but i love this film its a true classic br br <UNK> maverick <UNK> 10 10
<START> <UNK> classic plot but a <UNK> fun horror movie for home movie party really gore in the second part this movie proves that you can make something fun with a small budget i hope that the director will make another one
<START> when we talk hollywood hotel we could be talking about one of three things the actual hotel the radio program and this film which was partially inspired by the first two dick powell was the host of the hollywood hotel program on cbs radio network in which <UNK> parsons <UNK> out the weekly scoop on the stars br br powell and parsons <UNK> the hollywood hotel program in 1934 so by <UNK> it had its fair share of the radio audience powell <UNK> sang and <UNK> with <UNK> and her movie star guests with the power she had with her <UNK> she was able to get the various stars to go on and plug their latest films for nothing br br then the american <UNK> of radio artists stepped in and <UNK> she pay <UNK> <UNK> and they won the case that ended the hollywood hotel program in 1938 of course both powell and <UNK> went on to other radio <UNK> the whole story is covered in the tony thomas book the films of dick powell br br but before the plug was pulled this film came out from <UNK> home studio of warner brothers inspired by the radio program powell plays a singer <UNK> with the benny goodman band who gets signed to a hollywood contract but when he gets out to hollywood he gets himself <UNK> up with an <UNK> film star lola lane her <UNK> double real life sister <UNK> lane and a ham actor in alan <UNK> br br when <UNK> is called upon to sing in a civil war epic he's making with lola lane it's <UNK> voice they use then <UNK> develops a <UNK> <UNK> problem when he's asked to go on the hollywood hotel radio program broadcast from the hollywood hotel that's got the studio in a <UNK> let's say the problem isn't solved the way it is singing in the rain but <UNK> manager ted <UNK> proves to be <UNK> br br richard <UNK> and johnny <UNK> provide a really nice score for the film the big hit song comes right at the beginning as the benny goodman band with <UNK> singing <UNK> davis sing hollywood's <UNK> <UNK> for hollywood my favorite however is powell and <UNK> lane singing i'm like a fish out of water just listening to johnny <UNK> lyrics about ginger rogers running the brooklyn <UNK> or sally <UNK> without her fan it's a <UNK> of american popular culture in the thirties br br busby berkeley does the choreography here and while the film doesn't have the <UNK> imaginary stuff that his earlier work with warner brothers has the numbers are well staged <UNK> big moment is in a drive in <UNK> where powell and <UNK> have been forced to take jobs the number starts with benny goodman <UNK> from the hollywood hotel doing let that be a lesson to you and then at the drive in powell lane and the entire place start joining in song to the <UNK> of owner edgar kennedy and you know what you can expect from edgar kennedy <UNK> br br benny goodman gets to show why he was named the king of swing when the band with drummer gene <UNK> and <UNK> lionel <UNK> as part of his ensemble that together with frances <UNK> singing as well and possibly the last surviving cast member of the group was a fellow who had a small bit as a radio <UNK> he died in 2004 but not before he became the <UNK> president of the united states ronald reagan always credited dick powell and pat o'brien as being the two guys on warner brothers who were the most helpful to an eager young player looking to make his mark br br hollywood hotel is one delightful and entertaining motion picture dated but <UNK> so
<START> well if you are one of those <UNK> film nuts just like me you sure will appreciate this <UNK> <UNK> swinging blood spitting samurai action flick br br starring <UNK> <UNK> vital <UNK> illusion <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this samurai war between <UNK> clan versus <UNK> clan touch the <UNK> in the final showdown at <UNK> bridge the body count is countless br br demons magic swords <UNK> priests versus <UNK> monks and the beautiful visions provided by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> will do the rest br br a good japanese flick for a rainy summer night
<START> with <UNK> and <UNK> as the leads this film had good possibilities and with <UNK> as the bad guy after <UNK> maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening <UNK> and then later on with <UNK> war <UNK> it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and <UNK> or not the number one mistake was <UNK> <UNK> so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead <UNK> pulled at the easy and low cost <UNK> elements
<START> the last command <UNK> is a silent film directed by <UNK> von <UNK> it shows us <UNK> general grand duke <UNK> alexander <UNK> <UNK> in his days of glory in <UNK> he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of <UNK> russia he has nothing he also had the love of a woman natalie <UNK> evelyn brent about ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution his old enemy <UNK> <UNK> william powell is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not the last command is very good silent drama <UNK> <UNK> does memorable role work in the lead evelyn brent is wonderful playing the woman lead william powell is great as always there are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie like many scenes with <UNK> and brent and then there is the ending with powell and <UNK> this is a movie that touches in many parts
<START> not even timothy <UNK> or david duchovny could save this dead fish of a film for starters the script was definitely written to be made into a b film but somehow duchovny looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television and <UNK> looking for the two of a one two punch he had hoped would define his career after ordinary people became attached to the picture cheesy lines big bad <UNK> from scene to scene come on who uses <UNK> after <UNK> grade <UNK> class and plain old bad acting sink this film even duchovny is not <UNK> to the bad acting plague that is this film only timothy <UNK> rises above the material at all i must admit feeling <UNK> pain as he read the lines that are the voice over while i found myself laughing when i'm sure the director wanted me to feel terrified nothing prepared me for the closing line of <UNK> voice over if you ever need a doctor be sure to call <UNK> if only the studio had called <UNK> this dog of a motion picture would never have been made avoid at all costs br br
<START> a blair witch war movie that is as much of a letdown as <UNK> was the title says it all save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as once upon a time in america the <UNK> redemption or enemy at the gates if you want to watch a great war movie etc br br this movie if it were a baseball team and the major <UNK> were the <UNK> and single a was the <UNK> then this movie was high school ball it was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filming with their <UNK> old camera sure they went into a hostile area to make a film but i don't call that brave around here we call that plain stupid this is a pass all the way now go watch it and then you tell me what you think
<START> this has got to be the best movie i've ever seen br br combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot and you have a masterpiece br br dog bite dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes <UNK> in horror during others and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic ending br br the film left a deep impression on me it's shockingly violent scenes <UNK> <UNK> with the poignant and tender <UNK> scenes the film is <UNK> of it's cat iii nudity rating there are no nude scenes whatsoever and the <UNK> scenes do not even involve kissing or <UNK> <UNK> br br the message which this film presented to me all human beings no matter how violent or cruel they may seem have a tender side edison <UNK> does a superb job playing the part of the murderous <UNK> br br i rate this film 10 10 it's a must watch
<START> it's remarkable that for <UNK> mr <UNK> supporting players ford cast lesser known other than star actors this not only <UNK> his film's focus on the central character of lincoln but it also <UNK> the audience a refreshing insight into lincoln as a man of his place and time a man <UNK> as each one of us <UNK> is in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to <UNK> them it's not so much through <UNK> <UNK> words and actions but in the faces the reactions of the supporting players that ford tells the story of the <UNK> of the young <UNK> <UNK> sense of place in society and <UNK> and of how the people <UNK> to mr <UNK> words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and <UNK> br br give this a try instead of focusing on henry fonda next time you view <UNK> mr <UNK> shift your focus to the supporting characters you will i expect be <UNK> rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both lincoln and ford i like to suspect that ford's storytelling through the supporting characters' reactions to <UNK> lincoln may have <UNK> to david lean when he directed omar <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> in which it's the supporting characters' reactions to <UNK> that actually tell about <UNK>
<START> this film is awful the cgi is the very cheap gray blob cgi the crocodile looks like a large gray <UNK> the worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive it is mostly a photo <UNK> cgi that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the cgi <UNK> across the screen this is one of the worst examples of cgi effects that i have ever witnessed and i have seen lots of the very bad sci fi channel movies br br aside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical low cost actors who probably work as <UNK> <UNK> at local <UNK> while they wait for their big breaks perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the villains <UNK> and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building and <UNK> kate the croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water no laws of physics can apply to this movie or the special effects at least there is honor among <UNK>
<START> a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what <UNK> do that being stealing from <UNK> and killing prey until a trio of <UNK> decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem solved they are of course out <UNK> at every turn and while the trio are <UNK> out at the fox hole the family perform <UNK> against the three <UNK> land br br the film version and i use the term film very loosely is more of a god awful <UNK> of american heist movies particularly the <UNK> movies they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely so kudos to them they'll make lots of money and destroy another classic <UNK> <UNK> children book
<START> i cannot believe that they managed to spend us <UNK> on this film spectacularly bad acting <UNK> scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc unbelievable plot <UNK> a reporter who can get an inexperienced <UNK> a major job at the un what not only that but the message of this film is so <UNK> that you come out feeling as if they've tried to <UNK> you over the head with a full size <UNK> all this movie will do will <UNK> to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money if the makers of this film really wanted to <UNK> people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe they would have used the money to help people truly in need now that might have <UNK> some people into actually listening to them
<START> there's a great deal of material from the modesty blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie unfortunately several attempts have been made and they've fallen short of the great potential in the character so no this isn't the modesty you know from the comic strip currently <UNK> in nice <UNK> from <UNK> books this is modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip and from what you can piece together from her back story it's accurate br br <UNK> had the movie rights to the character with quentin tarantino acting as <UNK> and technical <UNK> early <UNK> of the <UNK> project attempted to adapt one of the best novels but always managed to leave out some crucial element tarantino wasn't happy with any of them and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed to the <UNK> credit they wanted to keep him in the process since they knew he got the character and her world with the movie rights close to <UNK> they decided to try a very different approach the result was my name is modesty a small direct to video movie that introduces the character br br the movie does not introduce willie <UNK> or sir <UNK> these characters are important to <UNK> adventures throughout most of the published stories what this movie <UNK> is showing the strength of the character by herself she never loses her <UNK> and you never doubt that she's in charge even <UNK> in a room full of gangsters with guns most of the movie takes place within a casino which undoubtedly saved money on the production it doesn't matter the film does not come across as cheap instead it gives a fairly <UNK> and believable back story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead should <UNK> adapt any of the comic stories or novels now they've laid out the character's background nicely and won't have to spend much time on her origin i realize the words direct to video don't inspire confidence but this film is well worth a look
<START> even if you're a huge sandler fan please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy i bought this movie for 7 99 assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked judging by the r rating and scantily clad women on the cover well there are quite a few scantily clad women but none get naked i'm not sure what point this was in <UNK> career but i'm guessing it was even before his snl days i can be wrong this is like watching one of his home movies he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and <UNK> about the good ol' times but we the audience are left to dry this is hardly a movie sandler does a lot of talking to the camera and even admits at one point that this is no budget movie that's right not a low budget movie a no budget movie so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters there is no steady plot it's like an extended sketch comedy show but a crude and badly written one that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic <UNK> <UNK> line take my wife please and the audience is on the floor i'm not even going to try to make any logic here sure <UNK> current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in billy madison the midget in happy <UNK> happy place but the comedy works this is a strictly amateurish work and even if you're curious about <UNK> early days in film you still won't be interested you're better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in mixed nuts of course the <UNK> is not the only actor wasted in this <UNK> vehicle billy bob <UNK> also makes a short appearance billy zane titanic has a supporting role and the great burt young from the rocky movies has a significant role br br this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99 <UNK> rental section of your local video store and rightfully so br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> i first read <UNK> <UNK> about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it it is a classic historical romance set in the <UNK> when the west country was several <UNK> journey from london and law and order was much harder to <UNK> sadly this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion the acting and production values are ok but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful why do television adaptations do this why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story one of life's great mysteries the bbc made an excellent version which was <UNK> at christmas in the early 1990s which i am still trying to track down a copy of take my advice read the book and don't bother with this <UNK> version
<START> the whole point of making this film one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera was to make it more accessible to the masses and it succeeded admirably in doing so the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 <UNK> and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly hence the visual <UNK> of the beautiful principals a young loren handsome della <UNK> and a <UNK> ms <UNK> who make the story much more believable giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being <UNK> into the lovely <UNK> who otherwise might not be altogether an enchanting introduction to one of <UNK> great works i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly <UNK> my interest in opera a form with which i was then not well <UNK> i still regard this film <UNK> and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals <UNK> della <UNK> was a standout as <UNK> and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films
<START> i had the misfortune to sit through the full <UNK> minutes of what in my opinion is this shockingly bad film it fails on pretty much all levels the cast is awful the acting ham at best and the plot lacks any depth leaving me feeling violently <UNK> as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines br br plan b has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and i found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular <UNK> <UNK> anywhere towards the region of comedy br br a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> turd of a movie
<START> the <UNK> guide to cinema 2007 br br if loving cinema makes me a <UNK> so be it br br if you are a true <UNK> like me then i'm sure you can't get enough of films about film making and i don't mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then i mean a total <UNK> on the film viewing experience well if that's the case have i got a <UNK> of a film experiment for you br br in sophie <UNK> sister of ralph joseph if you were wondering has noted <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive and often outrageous takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the <UNK> brothers <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> about the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> political and of course <UNK> magic of the film going experience with his <UNK> determined and near frenetic <UNK> to go from explaining how the <UNK> house in psycho is actually the <UNK> psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego <UNK> id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the <UNK> <UNK> br br although i had no idea who zizek was  he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian <UNK> european actor <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese  with his <UNK> tongue and passion the host comes across as a mad prophet br br <UNK> cleverly <UNK> zizek into several of the film <UNK> backgrounds <UNK> throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the <UNK> and raving continue full <UNK> giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick lynch hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz the red shoes and fight club br br there's something for everyone and if one man can <UNK> an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes  even if they are <UNK> <UNK> to a fault  then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video it's the only way to appreciate it
<START> i got the dvd very cheap and i'm a total <UNK> and thats probably the only <UNK> where this movie could ever interest anyone br br an early drew movie she's looking great and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her like a shower scene a sexy dance scene quite a number of sexy outfits etc she does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies br br the movie itself is pretty average or sub average and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema there is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy br br the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly don't understand it but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway but at least you don't get the end you would be expecting and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected br br overall i think this movie is exclusively for <UNK>
<START> oh what a bad bad very bad movie <UNK> by and starring <UNK> <UNK> should have been <UNK> featuring too many rock climbing scenes vertigo falling and scene chewing villains and a <UNK> <UNK> heist there are two plots both lame one involves a traumatic failed rescue and the other involves bad people <UNK> an airplane for <UNK> and killing various harmless people whenever possible the usually reliable john <UNK> perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product is reduced to <UNK> and calling those for whom he doesn't care <UNK> in a vague <UNK> of an english accent <UNK> turner who was <UNK> and enigmatic when she played maggie on northern exposure is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue <UNK> and pilot stallone is <UNK> and muscle headed no <UNK> lines in this one no living lines either
<START> i am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a 1 simply because i don't believe there is a worse movie in the world br br i hate this movie i hate the acting dialog setting writing and directing i hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and <UNK> in the darkest circle of hell br br damn this disgusting waste of time br br i pray every day that this movie is just a <UNK> of my imagination i pray that i <UNK> the movie and that i will never have to see it at br br my local video store again br br burn in hell
<START> after watching this movie on dvd i watched the trailer the voice over describes the movie as surreal well there's surreal and there's surreal br br there was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me but frankly it was more confusing than surreal the other unusual imagery particularly the <UNK> scene where everybody is on the floor were so nonsensical they had no meaning i don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything but these scenes just seemed irrelevant br br my impression is that the director was trying to convey <UNK> inner monologue i don't know what else would explain what was going on unfortunately nothing i saw gave me any clue what logan was thinking about what his perspective was or even his emotional state all i could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he had a crush on an older boy br br i thought the ending <UNK> what the relationship between the boys had become but not much else did <UNK> <UNK> ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision br br still as tiresome and as content free the movie was for me it was a definite change of pace i very much liked <UNK> skin and i had the feeling this movie <UNK> to that kind of narrative and perhaps even style it didn't even come close for me there's no question about it this movie deserves an a for effort but a d for execution
<START> it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie that to me and many others is one of the greatest film <UNK> ever made realizing this is simply a <UNK> made for tv film and that most people had <UNK> it i didn't expect much but you can't help but compare this with the <UNK> film scene after scene i found myself comparing what i was looking at it and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray barbara stanwyck edward g robinson and others now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna samantha <UNK> and lee j <UNK> br br when it was all over i found it wasn't as bad as i had expected but it's no match for the 1944 original the two main areas in which this made for tv film wasn't as good were 1 the electricity between the two leads was missing and 2 being only 90 minutes they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot characters and chemistry between those leads crenna and <UNK> were flat and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as walter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> respectively br br where this re make held its own was in the other characters such as barton <UNK> and edward norton <UNK> was terrific as <UNK> and robert <UNK> as norton head of the insurance company it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed so the houses cars <UNK> <UNK> machines etc were all early '70s instead of mid <UNK> otherwise the storyline was very similar just rushed br br however one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film
<START> i approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised it is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years especially strictly ballroom while the music is nice and the dancing colourful for me the movie is not about dancing it is about the very japanese institution that gives male office workers long <UNK> to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families here we have the man with the complete family and the large <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> for life he is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his <UNK> and this leads him to try ballroom dancing also japanese is the fact that the <UNK> motives that <UNK> his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted at least eventually by family and audience attitudes to ballroom dancing as conveyed in the film are definitely non western though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural <UNK> to japan the cultural <UNK> are thus intriguing even without the cultural insights the colour the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch
<START> i'm from <UNK> and therefore my english writing is rather poor sorry for that br br this is one of those little known movies that plays only once on tv and than seems to <UNK> into thin air i was <UNK> through my old vhs video collection and came across this title i looked it up and it had an imdb score of more than 7 10 that's pretty decent br br i must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why i'm puzzled this is the only film made by this director how come he didn't make lots of films after this rather good one someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie ha ha br br anyway i really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one please
<START> oh my how can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad i mean even uwe boll doesn't make crap like this there is not even a hint of a decent story multi layered characters or attraction it's just a random sequence of pointless <UNK> joined together to make a <UNK> i suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly <UNK> and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it but then again it's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age that there's probably no one that should watch this movie at all br br take my advice and stay far far away from this movie your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isn't able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to and please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of i'll give it 2 out of 10 and that's exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful they'd deserve a negative rating br br and if you decide to watch it anyways remember that i warned you
<START> i had high hopes for it when i heard that it was being made back in 2001 because i read the devil and daniel <UNK> when i was a kid and i found it very interesting they made some changes to the story that don't make much sense to me daniel <UNK> in the story was a famous lawyer from new <UNK> in the story in the movie he is an editor a lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing <UNK> stone against the devil him herself he was a man in the story but was a woman in the movie in a trial where both of their souls are on the line as an editor it doesn't seem likely that daniel <UNK> would have the skill to do this br br the acting was decent by all except for alec baldwin and dan <UNK> these are two actors that i like they just did an awful job in this movie it was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy this might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind and was then re edited by somebody else given this fact it's surprising that it was at all coherent i was surprised to see a fair amount of snl cast members in the movie which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy br br all in all i would have to say it wasn't completely awful but it wasn't much good if i could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it i would the ending was especially disappointing as in the original story daniel <UNK> <UNK> the devil in the trial <UNK> then starts out again at the beginning of the movie literally we are just brought back to the first scene with <UNK> and then the movie abruptly ends it actually looked as though they just <UNK> <UNK> first scene over and called it the end there is no indication that <UNK> has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained so who is to say he didn't just repeat his mistakes over again and perhaps over and over in an endless loop it was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense the decent cast and the acting of everyone except for baldwin and <UNK> are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap <UNK>
<START> deniro is a master one of my favourites and i love good sports movies not into baseball so much but hey its sports movies right i was expecting much more for this movie it seems to start out well deniro is what i expected snipes whom i don't really like is very good as the spoiled star <UNK> role to me was ok she's a good actress but seemed out of place in this role to me they always seemed to rush the scenes and then it drags a bit in places it just seemed <UNK> me to be so uneven considering the cast and the plot it could have been so much better i rated it a <UNK> and i was being generous i'm a tough one with numbers
<START> plot is never the strong point of a fred astaire and ginger rogers movie but follow the fleet 's screenplay is exceptionally mediocre fred and ginger still come off all right they play <UNK> baker and <UNK> martin dancers whose personal and professional <UNK> ended when <UNK> joined the navy when they meet again their love hate relationship <UNK> some entertaining comic moments but for much of the movie they take a <UNK> to a tedious subplot about <UNK> sister connie harriet <UNK> her love for sailor <UNK> smith randolph scott <UNK> <UNK> with another woman and an old <UNK> that connie inherited from her father though <UNK> is rather charming this plot is uninteresting br br but at the same time follow the fleet is blessed with an exceptional irving berlin score that gives the stars plenty of chances to show off their talents astaire gets two good <UNK> with we saw the sea and i'd rather lead a band he sings <UNK> and of course dances <UNK> and the sailor suit makes him look a little more <UNK> and athletic than usual rogers sings the catchy let yourself go and later does a solo tap dance to the same tune br br the three <UNK> really save the film even though they're all <UNK> into the plot with silly excuses fred and ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another <UNK> of let yourself go later they sing and dance i'm putting all my eggs in one basket as if it were an early rehearsal of the number <UNK> the choreography to comic effect at the end the movie finally figures out how to get fred and ginger in evening clothes for a romantic <UNK> it makes it part of a show within the show the situation is contrived but the song let's face the music and dance is one of the most <UNK> beautiful things berlin ever wrote it's reminiscent of cole porter and the dancing matches it in <UNK> quintessential astaire and rogers br br it would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of follow the fleet again and in fact it's not necessary because the plot rarely <UNK> the musical numbers but i could watch the songs over and over
<START> spoilers through br br i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie it's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an <UNK> <UNK> ride i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating br br perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven't seen the original something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus have little to compare it to this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original br br there were a few things i liked about it one was the casting of <UNK> viggo <UNK> was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders he really needed to be excellent and he was this was a great role for him br br another interesting thing about <UNK> point was the fact that it's made for television i had no idea this was the case when watching it it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release br br i also found the story to be very absorbing i'm not one for action movies but i got sucked into this plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama <UNK> a love story quirky people every which way you turned i didn't even recognize <UNK> and it was touching this was not a great movie but it is watchable br br and then there's the ending it packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point it's very difficult not to be <UNK> at the very end i am not sure how i feel about the ending the <UNK> was that <UNK> survived and though i'm highly skeptical of how that would be possible it is a movie and realism isn't an <UNK> that's always in the mix when making a movie br br so i'd have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way which i don't usually like but for some reason is almost forgivable in this movie admittedly a lot of things were just props for the plot could the villains have been anymore stereotypical but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well however having said that i will admit i can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because though i have not seen the original i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results my big dislike is actually sequels but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality br br people have compared this to <UNK> and the <UNK> how about a road version of legends of the fall meets thelma and <UNK> as well i sure felt touches of both films both of which i'm a fan of i do not think however that this was a great film it was better then average to me but far from great but it was an absorbing <UNK> <UNK> touching movie with excellent casting of the main character my vote is 7 of 10
<START> yep lots of shouting screaming cheering arguing celebrating fist <UNK> high <UNK> fighting you have a general idea as to why but can never be 100 certain a naval knowledge would be an advantage for the <UNK> points but then you'd probably spot the many flaws not an awful film hackman washington are their usual brilliant but the plot was one you could <UNK> pretty early on i'm still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other don't argue but then you probably wouldn't have a film br br 4 10
<START> david <UNK> creates a role that he was to <UNK> somewhat in <UNK> the troubled talent and it is a role he plays well br br this thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end timothy <UNK> plays a fine villain and angelina jolie <UNK> the story of a <UNK> doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted drug addiction and a desire for the <UNK> jolie mix a <UNK> cocktail unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the fbi is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene but that aside a movie worth seeing
<START> seriously i'm all for <UNK> romantic comedies and will get sucked into miss <UNK> as easily as <UNK> but this movie it doesn't make any sense and i'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense why does her family live in england or at the very least why doesn't she have a british accent she's sure <UNK> with her dad and he's surprisingly <UNK> of her not being around for the last two years on that subject no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long and what was with the goofy outfits at the <UNK> party i'm not even going to get into the fact that the <UNK> she paid for falls in love with her that could've been overcome by better movie making i'm just saying that the characters the setting and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story oh and the worst part in my opinion is the <UNK> consistent use of the most <UNK> angles on deborah <UNK> nose i'd have <UNK> the filmmakers if i were her i mean honestly i'm all for women being who they are but why in seven loyal years of will and grace viewing have i not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is oh because those producers are kind to her this movie like my other least favorite movie ever <UNK> is the fault of the filmmakers not the actors i can see both messing and mcdermott in these roles with a better writer director and producer br br this easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies i've ever wasted time on i'm just glad a friend <UNK> me her dvd so all i wasted was time if there were a way to make this review zero stars i'd do it
<START> this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much <UNK> he was faced with after i saw this movie there was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
<START> wow this film is truly awful i can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the <UNK> the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast the story is disjointed <UNK> and incoherent the telling <UNK> and predictable no wit no charm no humour not sexy in the least the characters remain as flat as the proverbial <UNK> there's also a strong current of <UNK> which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on when your lead <UNK> is unfunny and unappealing it's <UNK> from there despite it's phony turn around ending where love <UNK> over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach if this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed
<START> i found a dvd of i dream of <UNK> in the 1 00 bin at wal mart when i saw that it was the story of stephen foster being a musician and music <UNK> i had to see it i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover just that it was a remake of <UNK> <UNK> river bill <UNK> portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful sometimes laughable the man has no <UNK> and is a <UNK> all the way through i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music <UNK> were doing him a favor by <UNK> his songs without paying him for them in addition to that ridiculous notion there is a nearly 20 minute segment of ray <UNK> and his black faced christy <UNK> performing stephen <UNK> songs that was difficult to watch to say the least i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to <UNK> in our current time it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten fortunately stephen <UNK> songs will never be forgotten also <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history
<START> to me this was more a wake up call and realization that most all we see hear read and think about most anything is <UNK> on what the media <UNK> us this is a classic example of high level spin doctors attempting to control the masses through controlled information it is also an excellent example of how people that have a <UNK> that they <UNK> bought in to will not be <UNK> by this media control or any attempted <UNK> information once again this shows that at the end of the day the needs of the many will in fact <UNK> the needs of the few it is also <UNK> to see that in in a country where there is no religious civil war going on that democracy is not a real hard thing to <UNK>
<START> stewart kane gabriel <UNK> vanity fair heads out with his local <UNK> australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest recreation and <UNK> but when stewart discovers an <UNK> woman's body floating face down in a river things appear to have turned out for the worst the largest <UNK> of the weekend is the men's <UNK> they don't <UNK> out of the <UNK> and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches then they head out and report the body br br the town and the men's lives quickly turn into a mess the local media <UNK> them and <UNK> of <UNK> prejudices rear up from the local natives stewart's wife claire laura <UNK> the <UNK> of emily rose senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did but has to battle with it through her own mental illness br br amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle <UNK> out on a <UNK> <UNK> her murder and subsequent <UNK> into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of <UNK> a division of men and women black and white social and <UNK> br br the only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids stewart and <UNK> son who is being led around by a half breed aussie who's mother was killed also just a few years before the young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this again the underlying current of <UNK> is <UNK> br br everything and everyone in this <UNK> <UNK> feels what <UNK> beneath its surface yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of <UNK> under its surface none that is until claire forces them to br br the movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted there are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn't get done too many loose threads the acting was okay but the filming was terrible <UNK> cameras grainy or dark shots and just a <UNK> <UNK> hurt the overall production br br i enjoy symbolic films <UNK> being one of my all time favorites in that vein but <UNK> needed to peak its head above the <UNK> water so that it could see its own problems which simply didn't happen
<START> how this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me the only actor who is at all known to me is judge <UNK> an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production br br i don't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten <UNK> award this film really does make b movies a cinematic enjoyment a car travelling along the <UNK> with police in <UNK> and no one knows how to stop the car yeah right br br the script must have been written on the back of a cigarette <UNK> most made for tv movies are awful but this <UNK> the word check out the acting skills of the bridge <UNK> pure oscar material
<START> written and directed by steve gordon running time <UNK> minutes classified pg br br it was the quintessential comedy of the decade it won sir john gielgud the academy award it was even featured in <UNK> i love the 80's and it looks just as good today as it did upon it's initial release arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire played with enthusiasm and wit by dudley moore in an oscar nominated performance who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown <UNK> to while the basic plot is one big cliche there's nothing trite about this <UNK> combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce arthur bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk but you can't help but like him especially when he delivers lines such as don't you wish you were me i know i do he's also a <UNK> from the <UNK> movie hero unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen he's not ashamed of being filthy rich in one scene a man asks him what does it feel like to have all that money to which he responds it feels great moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be <UNK> by his audience and gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant addressing his master with extreme <UNK> in spite of the fact that his <UNK> depends on him arthur is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional it just comes naturally the screenplay which also earned a nod from the academy is <UNK> with authentic laugh out loud dialogue this is the kind of movie that when together with a bunch of poker buddies you quote endlessly to one another it also looks at its characters with sincere empathy there have been a number of comedies that attempt to <UNK> into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star including both grumpy old men's but few can carry it off because we just don't care when this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler it actually works because we genuinely like these people why should you see arthur the answer is simple because it's an all around non guilty pleasure at a period in which films are becoming more and more serious arthur reminds us what it feels like to go to the movies and just have a good time br br classic
<START> i saw an interview with rob schneider who plays the lead character marvin <UNK> in this film he said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you'd be laughing at this movie obviously that must be the secret i had the volume turned up i was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster and completely unfunny a major disappointment after <UNK> hilarious performance in <UNK> <UNK> male <UNK> br br the story is stupid <UNK> is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal <UNK> after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named dr wilder michael <UNK> and as a result starts to lose control of his animal instincts this makes him a <UNK> he can <UNK> out drugs hidden in body <UNK> and <UNK> horses of course he also has a nasty habit of eating people's <UNK> and trying to seduce their <UNK> but surely that's a small price to pay it just didn't do anything for me br br the cast left much to be desired is there a more irritating actor in all of hollywood than john <UNK> here he plays sgt <UNK> <UNK> commander on the police force as a <UNK> cartoonish character much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular tv series <UNK> i was anxious to get a look at <UNK> <UNK> first serious acting job can anything in this movie be called serious she of course gained her fame as a contestant on the first survivor and she proves here what we knew from that she's cute as a button what she doesn't prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress and what's with ed <UNK> as police chief wilson i mean how old is this guy now he's the size of some of the <UNK> <UNK> tried to eat and he seemed out of breath the whole way through i'm surprised he made it through the filming there's a brief cameo at the end by adam sandler who also served as executive producer of this br br anyway i <UNK> twice <UNK> playing with his <UNK> toys in the police car and the scene schneider has with <UNK> and the <UNK> the <UNK> has more acting talent so for two chuckles 2 10
<START> i have to say i was very curious on viewing this film and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th century fox in 1970 it has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films and this only <UNK> an interest as i just had to see what made this movie so bad upon seeing it i think i have my answers although i will say it does make for curious viewing the acting direction and script are so <UNK> bad that the supposed satire is completely missing <UNK> welch seems to try to carry the film but after the opening sequence of the sex change operation the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone john huston as uncle buck loner is certainly no help as he <UNK> and <UNK> at the screen he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he's doing there rex reed <UNK> around as <UNK> <UNK> alter ego and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene bravo for debut performances farrah fawcett plays a dumb blonde she certainly seemed convincing in this role but of course arguably the most notorious role went to mae west the sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual <UNK> seemed more suitable for a horror film i don't mean to put this cast down personally but in this film no one comes out looking good the direction seems so <UNK> and non existent that the film is not only bad but boring as well throw in some old film footage of old stars and the movie becomes even more <UNK> to each his own to anyone that enjoyed this and i was glad i at least saw it but myra <UNK> seems to be the disaster that it was always <UNK> to be from the beginning
<START> the only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches br br <UNK> spoiler alert death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in twilight zone the movie which delivers death by cartoon still this was handled nicely especially watching the <UNK> bleed and the color being <UNK> out br br additionally there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle br br having said that i was glad i got the dvd cheap at a store going out of business sale because this was pretty awful i bought soul survivors at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant <UNK> that you have been watching a dream however where soul survivors has nothing to redeem it or have it make any sense this at least had a couple of stylish notes referred to above br br interestingly the dvd lets you go to the 8 <UNK> where something actually happens which is the only way to watch this the scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable br br 3 out of 10
<START> well chuck jones is dead lets <UNK> his characters by adding cheap explosions an american drawn anime knock off style and give them <UNK> but sir don't we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this much less don't dump all over their original creators dreams yes and those shows make us a bunch of cash and we need more but won't every man women and child who grew up with these time less characters be annoyed <UNK> you're right set it in the future make them all <UNK> of the original characters and change all the names slightly but not too much though we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics br br well that's the only reason i can think of why this even exists if you look past the horrible <UNK> of our beloved looney <UNK> then it looks like an ok show but then there is already the teen <UNK> which is the same bloody thing all the characters are dressed like batman they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains they have <UNK> only difference is they sort of talk like the looney tunes and have similar names and character traits br br this kind of thing falls into the it's so ridiculous it's good kind of category think of the super mario brother's movie and batman and robin if you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons check this out if you are of the younger generation what this thing is actually intended for and can look pass the greedy executives <UNK> then run with it and enjoy br br if you enjoy this cartoon i don't have a problem with you it's the people who <UNK> this thing together that i am mad at you know how they say <UNK> is like stealing a car this show is like grave robbing they might as well of <UNK> up all the people involved with the original cartoon shoved them on a display dressed them up <UNK> pirate costumes and charged money if this show wasn't using characters ones that didn't resemble the looney <UNK> in anyway whatsoever that have already made the studios millions then this would be fine but no for shame warner brothers for shame br br if i saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the <UNK> or family guy i would love it as it is i just can't believe this was ever made i would bet anyone that 80 of the people who work on this show hate it but whatever it doesn't really matter in 10 years this show will have been forgotten while the originals will live on <UNK> at least until the world ends br br coming 2008 <UNK> and the <UNK> gang are back and now they have freaking <UNK> and can turn invisible can <UNK> brown defeat the evil alien <UNK> <UNK> tune in and see
<START> another outstanding foreign film which thoroughly <UNK> the never ending crop of <UNK> <UNK> from hollywood this is a story of life and living no definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial hollywood movies but rather the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses just like real people in our lives and ourselves br br the dynamics of all of these lives <UNK> within the walls of this <UNK> and particularly its aged owner are magnificent heart touching and highly thought provoking br br sit back relax and be carried away into the simple and beautiful life there is real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to it br br you will not be disappointed
<START> as a sequel this is not a bad movie i actually liked it better than the 1st one i found it more entertaining it seemed like it was shot documentary style at first this bothered me as i thought it just looked too low budget but it grew on me and it made the movie seem more authentic this movie has more dry one liners than the original which is a good thing in my opinion i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters it almost becomes a parody of itself which may be the point this movie at least has some suspense which the 1st one did not have in my view it has some of the same great music from the original which is great the acting again was pretty decent for the most part though like i said some of it seemed over the top i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow like the rest of the movie overall though i thought this was a pretty sequel my rating for return to cabin by the lake is 7 10
<START> the movie starts off in a <UNK> setting where not surprisingly our main actress <UNK> was seen in a chinese language class later in the film she was asked on why by <UNK> that she was sent to learn <UNK> her answer was simple for a child she is <UNK> she's already known the <UNK> language well br br it's a bit of a romance one may thought of it but once you've stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it you'll notice the typical elements of <UNK> the movie basically focuses on 10 year old <UNK> who met 12 year old <UNK> in a game of which many would think of it as a boy's game running out of players <UNK> who was new in that village was forced to allow <UNK> into the game in which she eagerly showed the male side of her <UNK> is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie defending <UNK> from much violent encounter with her school bullies throwing one of the <UNK> bag out from the school bus window throwing punches and kicks on <UNK> brother where after he <UNK> <UNK> and so on and so forth both were awesome buddies and stick closer than that but with a slightest of <UNK> in which most of us would all respond to in the same way <UNK> the both of them until the day when <UNK> left town br br now the movie depicts the first love between <UNK> and <UNK> they started out as friends but slowly <UNK> into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards <UNK> you would notice the changes <UNK> made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love the different character was portrayed with <UNK> and mild humor the scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that you'd be stuck on the screen for a long time you will love the movie for what it is and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes <UNK> it means much more br br as the movie <UNK> around the two love birds it also manages to find its lens towards <UNK> parents her mother who was educated in england speaks very good english and in which her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of english which was humor all the way indeed let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie and that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is <UNK> often more than not we don't learn to laugh at ourselves and when we do we do it at the expense of others it is just like what the movie just follow law by jack neo would have mentioned often when we are ourselves we don't see the person in us we are but when only when we are in another person's body then only would we learn to see who we really are and that is how humor applies as well more so than just dignity br br the movie was filled with such <UNK> that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be br br the other focus of this movie was on how <UNK> neighbor a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife and wanted to find another <UNK> <UNK> as what he's <UNK> after was seen <UNK> his <UNK> daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend the producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife the wife was a real <UNK> or <UNK> as we chinese would call it having <UNK> on other people's business and sending her own daughter to <UNK> <UNK> in words only adults would use after all what goes around comes around and that's probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her in every time being nice to people around you won't hurt at all unless you have an ego to protect but then again what's it worth the movie also centers around <UNK> brother <UNK> who would go out to town everyday until very late at night smoking drinking and also finding <UNK> he's the total opposite of <UNK> but that's all perhaps because of family problems both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them i will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all she wanted us me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves movies in a way take us out from our own body places us in the character's position and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it depending on the type and genre of the movie you will be <UNK> by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you
<START> this is one of those movies that's trying to be moody and tense and instead ends up <UNK> all over itself having seen it at a <UNK> film festival i was intrigued by the young college <UNK> gone wrong write up however over all ended up quite disappointed br br it's hard to critique a true story since there's not much that can be done about the plot but i found this disjointed melodramatic and wholly depressing it's dark and almost sinister painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with <UNK> music and jerky close ups it just doesn't work some scenes where so cheesy that instead of <UNK> awe my audience was <UNK> <UNK> and rolling eyes br br the story has an interesting premise but this just <UNK> <UNK> into a dark miserable spiral
<START> not a movie but a lip <UNK> collection of performances from acts that were part of the british invasion that followed the dynamic entrance of the beatles to the music world some of these acts did not make a big <UNK> on this side of the pond but a lot of them did featured are <UNK> <UNK> billy j kramer and the <UNK> peter and gordon <UNK> <UNK> teens animals and of course the beatles br br it is so much fun watching these young acts before they <UNK> and polished their acts
<START> this is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of <UNK> hitler that i have ever watched robert <UNK> is a wonderful actor but to cast him as hitler is just plain wrong to cast <UNK> <UNK> as hitler's longtime friend and aid <UNK> must have <UNK> cries of despair and anguish from the simon <UNK> centre a j w playing a nazi <UNK> bad bad bad casting this was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background this was hollywood rubbish at its finest <UNK> in on the strength of a strong but sorely under <UNK> supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past 5 years br br the fake german accents <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is insulting to german people everywhere my mother is german and she sat <UNK> at the sound of the voices which kept switching from american english german all in the same sentence the supporting cast make better cardboard <UNK> at the local video store than they do on screen jenna malone as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was splendid though she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in hitler's shadow br br if you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of hitler's early years leading up to and including the war holocaust rent inside the third <UNK> 1983 starring <UNK> <UNK> as albert <UNK> and derek <UNK> as hitler it was good and made more sense then this <UNK> br br as a historical <UNK> of the third <UNK> i can honestly tell you this had me reaching for my books to confirm its <UNK> of inaccuracies
<START> <UNK> <UNK> film may be not so famous as <UNK> view 3 days of the <UNK> or <UNK> but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic <UNK> of the genre action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed after several years of investigation special government <UNK> decides that president was killed by a lone <UNK> but one man <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> thinks there's something more to be <UNK> and so the film starts this movie doesn't deal with some exact theories but it <UNK> the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today's world such film could be made only in the 1970 <UNK> but it will never lose it's <UNK> furthermore it's even a bit <UNK> how precise are it's <UNK> 10 out of 10
<START> i'd love to give kolchak a higher rating but the show quickly went from scary suspenseful to silly <UNK> fault they moved the show to friday nights at 8 00 p m then known as the family hour never should have been on <UNK> in the first place i was a <UNK> in high school and loved the early episodes it was first up against police woman on nbc abc had huge problems with friday nights bad season for them overall until barney miller <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in january of <UNK> kolchak should have been a hit darren <UNK> <UNK> to get out of his contract to end the show too bad the writing wasn't up to richard <UNK> in the original tv movies still <UNK> made kolchak his own as actors can do jackie <UNK> as ralph <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> come to mind that ins set with the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> seems quaint and ancient today yet that was part of the appeal they were very lucky to have simon <UNK> <UNK> vincenzo from the tv films
<START> i would just like all of the fans of this documentary to know that martin <UNK> is my uncle and i am so darn proud of him this mini series that in shown on <UNK> is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it the amount of time and effort that i have watched him put into this documentary and the book that started it all can't find my way home makes it that much better to watch him on tv i know that he loves what he does and he does it well his <UNK> is shown in the interviews which he did himself and the amazing <UNK> that he himself adds to the commentary from the music to the videos and everything in between this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it i appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it or didn't and would love to hear from fans three cheers for uncle martin
<START> this is a low budget spoof of the espionage genre to help frame your expectations you should know that 1 the acting is wildly heavy handed the stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement frequent hand gestures and off key pacing 2 the script deliberately lacks continuity and <UNK> <UNK> lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements 3 shots are frequently framed in off balance angles <UNK> fun at genre <UNK> 4 a pop eyed jeff goldblum delivers complex and <UNK> preposterous dialog in a <UNK> sarcastic manner br br the film has a <UNK> intelligence deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the b films of the 1930's a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by carl <UNK> the film's over the top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes in an early running gag fay <UNK> son ned is so frequently told to leave that you can't help <UNK> while feeling sorry for the <UNK> parker <UNK> nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film br br the film's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge the film's impact as drama is significantly <UNK> by the early comedy moreover it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their <UNK> when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic the musical score is intentionally heavy handed and i found this and the off <UNK> camera angles more irritating than humorous br br the over the top acting the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of <UNK> counter <UNK> and the slow pacing will <UNK> on many viewers the movie is much too long at <UNK> minutes br br that said fans who are <UNK> to the film's sarcasm might want to watch again using closed <UNK> to best catch the intelligent <UNK> of the dialog the film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy handed than light hearted but the comedy may well appeal to your tastes the film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films fans of director hal <UNK> or <UNK> of parker posey who has the most camera time
<START> from the first moment this thing is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of <UNK> camera work while the overall plot has every potential for a thriller the story is so badly told that i'm unable to buy it from the middle of the film the actions of characters don't make sense to me stop reading now to avoid spoilers br br for instance <UNK> idea to have <UNK> make coffee for them after having shot off her son's arm is way below his alleged experience it's just an extremely stupid idea domino not questioning the <UNK> orders she receives from <UNK> williams over a breaking up phone connection just <UNK> me shouldn't she be long suspicious that williams is turning them in those fbi agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot out besides what they do by <UNK> and <UNK> information towards <UNK> is pretty much <UNK> to murder it seems to me like farewell to justice if that's they way the fbi does <UNK> in reality they'd have a case messed up beyond <UNK> if they acted like this we get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few <UNK> quite the contrary the accident is immediately followed by domino making love to <UNK> which is from <UNK> viewpoint in no way <UNK> by previous events but just by being drugged to the <UNK> br br the whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of <UNK> williams appears to me just as want to be dramatic <UNK> <UNK> this combined with the awful uneasy camera work just makes a piece i hesitate to call a movie i'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors whose talent is out of question
<START> this obvious pilot for an <UNK> tv series features young canadian actress <UNK> <UNK> as an <UNK> with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man turned flying demon is let loose on the world the cgi is par for a tv job and <UNK> is ok as an <UNK> but hard to swallow as a <UNK> familiar tv face richard <UNK> is along for the ride as <UNK> mentor but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start a bad sign also the scenes where <UNK> is training <UNK> for battle are actually laughable they are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies most notably <UNK> williams
<START> my short comment for this flick is go pick it up chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller there is no way the character of <UNK> claiming and pushing for room in every way possible wont push your nerves to the edge 2 thumbs up
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> death wish copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well <UNK> brunette <UNK> supreme <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> clark a top notch martial arts fighter and one woman <UNK> crew who opens up a gigantic ten <UNK> drum of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a on <UNK> no count <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low life criminals attack her beloved grand parents the stunningly <UNK> ms <UNK> sinks her teeth into her <UNK> butt <UNK> tough chick part with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> beating jerky guys up with <UNK> glee and <UNK> her smoking hot <UNK> in a few utterly gratuitous but much appreciated nude scenes unfortunately <UNK> possesses an extremely irritating chewing on <UNK> harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears my favorite moment concerning <UNK> dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she <UNK> don't mess with girls in the park that's not nice after <UNK> a few <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> sole subsequent film role was in <UNK> angel in which she does a truly eye popping full frontal nude scene but doesn't have any lines the film's single most <UNK> sleazy sequence <UNK> when <UNK> gets briefly <UNK> on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene of course <UNK> <UNK> lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her <UNK> advances <UNK> with a severe <UNK> strangely enough the lesbian <UNK> <UNK> and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars given an extra <UNK> shot in the <UNK> <UNK> arm by edward <UNK> <UNK> direction a funky <UNK> score <UNK> crummy acting by a game if lame cast a constant snappy pace numerous pull out all the stops exciting fight scenes and howard anderson <UNK> gritty photography this immensely enjoyable <UNK> exploitation <UNK> is essential viewing for hardcore fans of <UNK> low grade low budget <UNK> cinema junk
<START> the movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the novel if you want to see the movie then don't read the novel first as it will shock you however cinematography was ok and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores africa then go for it acting performances are adequate however many important events that were present in the novel are <UNK> in the novel sir henry curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father <UNK> was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king
<START> this film was great br br the plot was preposterous br br the action sequences contrived br br but provided you can <UNK> up enough to laugh it was a <UNK> thrilling romp combining <UNK> cops and the lone ranger br br the baddies were more silly than bad the good guys weren't too good the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes br br the inclusion of a baby added a good touch sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise br br i have to disagree about the acting it was on the whole very good i really wanted to punch judge <UNK> br br and after all isn't that the mark of a really good movie wanting to punch judge <UNK>
<START> if it <UNK> like garbage and if it looks like garbage it must be garbage this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life tony scott's poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of domino <UNK> life as a bounty hunter the story is completely <UNK> and confusing to watch certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable it seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting <UNK> knightley does get totally naked in this one though that is the one and only upside to this film if you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you'll catch a whole lot of <UNK> i strongly suggest that no one see this movie ever 3
<START> i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that the other day i was <UNK> and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little i'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and i'm shocked honestly by this rating of 5 8 i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun br br charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog carface but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that can't stop <UNK> or that's the end of his life again when he and his best friend itchy look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races charlie takes the girl ann marie and makes fake promises in order to get the money but he ends up learning that maybe he should put ann marie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeance br br all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film it's not disney but this is an excellent family film to watch not to mention that it's just so cute and touching i know it's <UNK> and some people call me crazy but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls how could they not they're just so loving and i think i'm going to cry again but anyways i would just recommend this movie for anyone it's a fun movie to watch br br 7 10
<START> gee what a heck of a movie i said i wanted to become a <UNK> in bad movies from all decades so i decided to start by this one it was a pretty adequate choice i entered this adventure to find some lost gems and <UNK> masterpieces but i didn't see anything of the sort in this <UNK> <UNK> mess i haven't really watched many bad films before but i've got the feeling this is what's called so bad that's good probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny first of all there are the inaccuracies there are plot related inaccuracies physical inaccuracies and also psychological inaccuracies the latter in particular are as insane as van <UNK> ass <UNK> inside that blue <UNK> extremely tacky lines exist too and i won't even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves there isn't exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie except in one particular case geoffrey lewis looks completely pathetic as frank which is an utterly stupid character and to tell the truth i was actually very surprised to see that van damme did a decent job playing the twins he succeeded in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles that was convincing to me but the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major motion picture studio which is now <UNK>
<START> might contain possible spoilers not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter br br why does disney feel the need to <UNK> everything they ever made into oblivion sure it's cheaper for them but after a while wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon <UNK> that make absolutely no sense at all some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are the voices don't even remotely match up and <UNK> is evil again since when i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films even the movie's musical number which had been disney's <UNK> for years <UNK> i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality
<START> every time you think you have a handle on deathtrap another plot twist comes along best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one most noted for its on screen kiss between michael caine and christopher reeve which was unfortunately cut from the <UNK> version i saw this movie has a great deal more to recommend it br br sidney <UNK> michael caine is a very unhappy man once a successful playwright his last several plays on broadway have <UNK> and while his wife myra <UNK> cannon is nothing but supportive in both the <UNK> and emotional sense this does little to make sidney feel any better to add insult to injury young playwright <UNK> anderson christopher reeve has just sent sidney a play to look at it's <UNK> first and sidney can see that the young man is a gifted writer he jokes to his wife that he should invite anderson over kill him and submit the play as his own she laughs with him at first but when sidney actually invites anderson over for dinner she <UNK> that he may really be putting his scheme into action and her fears just may be justified br br it's a brilliant script there are twists and turns all through the plot and they come faster and more furious as you get closer to the end it's the kind of film that has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning and keeps you there the entire time an absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery br br the acting is excellent caine gives his usual excellent performance and he does exhibit a knack for playing <UNK> <UNK> and intellectual men reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who isn't nearly as wide eyed or innocent as he seems <UNK> <UNK> works well for myra and irene worth gives a nice performance as a <UNK> neighbor who is also a psychic br br this is a film with an ending you'd never expect and repeated <UNK> help to pick up on things missed in earlier viewings an <UNK> classic that is unfortunately only remembered for a scene which <UNK> some sensibilities at the time and that is a real shame
<START> it is a great movie i <UNK> that some people think that this might not be based on a true story no matter this the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little girl's wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true the little girl <UNK> in the movie and her mom were the best actors i've been seen in a long time good for they for all actors all for the director if someone can tell them this please tell them a 25 year guy from romania says thank you for making this movie
<START> oh wow i saw this film at the irish international film <UNK> in manhattan on 12 march 2000 both stars were in <UNK> and were available for questions afterward what a gorgeous film although set in ireland amid catholic <UNK> <UNK> the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other the horror of how quickly people can get carried away when they are given a chance to <UNK> their hate and anger was woven beautifully with a moving love story <UNK> with humor and fun if this one does not get picked up in the usa it would truly be most unfortunate br br as for the stars and supporting players first rate they call <UNK> brady the irish meryl streep i heard it is my opinion that she is better than meryl streep they should be calling meryl the american <UNK> brady and liam <UNK> steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant br br see this movie
<START> the only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves for viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three br br the story is a slice of life about <UNK> surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave but for any wave at all j c sean pertwee is an aging super <UNK> who is <UNK> with a commitment with his girlfriend chloe catherine zeta jones just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the bone yard the trouble is there are no waves until the very end of the film so most of the story <UNK> itself on a meandering succession of <UNK> beach happenings br br the acting is mostly mediocre sean pertwee has a few comical moments but mostly his acting was mundane ewan <UNK> was decent as the drug dealing wild man by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch probably the funniest performance was turned in by peter <UNK> as terry who turned his <UNK> body into a <UNK> sight gag catherine zeta jones was sexy as usual but her character didn't really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability br br there is really not much here on which to comment i rated it a 3 10 it's a real beach <UNK>
<START> this movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that i have ever seen i am not a religious person but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience one suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to life br br i must admit that when i first heard about this movie i was <UNK> i thought the plot sounded contrived and i was afraid that the story would be banal but being a david lynch fan i decided to give it a go it took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie but then i was completely lost in it there is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie i left the cinema feeling that i had truly learned something valuable about life br br this is not a typical david lynch movie and in some ways it was very surprising that he should make such a film after exploring the dark sides of human nature for so many years on the other hand i am not surprised that he manages to convey deep emotions and profound human insight because i also thought he managed that very well in the elephant man lynch is one of the most gifted directors around and i think the straight story is his best yet 9 5 10
<START> it was the sixties and anyone with long hair and a hip distant attitude could get money to make a movie that's how michael sarne director of this <UNK> flop was able to get the job sarne is one of the most <UNK> <UNK> people ever given a dollar to make a movie in fact the whole studio must have been tricked into <UNK> to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film a terribly precious 60's hip black and white <UNK> called joanna that film starred the similarly talentless actress <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat like <UNK> sarne who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon never mind a big budget hollywood film was in way over his head david <UNK> book is the best place to go to find out how the faux <UNK> terrible sarne was able to pull the <UNK> over everyone's eyes if there is ever an historical <UNK> which <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of an era myra <UNK> provides that <UNK> it <UNK> the <UNK> and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea change in the body <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> of another equally important vein watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less often mentioned <UNK> of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years br br many reviewers have spoken about the inter cutting of footage from other films especially older ones some actually liked these clunky comments on what was taking place in the movie others found them senseless annoying and <UNK> though since the film is so bad itself any <UNK> would have to be an improvement br br in my opinion the real reason michael sarne put so many film clips into myra <UNK> was to paper over the <UNK> <UNK> of wit and imagination that he possessed that is to say sarne was so imagination challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time they weren't inspiration they were desperation his writing skills were nonexistent and david <UNK> had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a <UNK> bomb so sarne was left to actually try and make a movie and he couldn't it was beyond his slim <UNK> hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips the ghosts of writers and directors many long since passed on were called upon to fix this <UNK> <UNK> because sarne sure as heck wasn't able to this was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew not to mention the producers and the <UNK> <UNK> their heels and waited for something some great spark of imagination a hint of originality a <UNK> of wit to <UNK> forth from the brow of <UNK> um <UNK> no <UNK> no imagination no sparks millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings each made from the hundreds of <UNK> <UNK> required to use the clips flying out the window bye bye br br as for myself i hated the film clips they <UNK> <UNK> many <UNK> <UNK> fun at people whose talents even those whose skills were not great far <UNK> the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration originality and even of plain <UNK> compared to even the <UNK> of them
<START> that movie was awesome i can't get over it's songs i think i'm a little too old for musicals but that movie deserves some credit here guys my <UNK> favorite was jack wild me being a british actor lover you can't <UNK> me from all those nice looking fresh faced young men i never knew that when jack was doing that movie he was sixteen he looks like an eleven year old he's short that's what helps try <UNK> up your replies fellow posters so i can relate to your experiences oh and about oliver reed that guy bill <UNK> i think that <UNK> look is really familiar any idea where he's starred in before if so post it up i'd really like to know
<START> way back when the x files was an intelligent thought provoking show a big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to <UNK> and science for their ideas <UNK> the plot to the spooky side of real life br br i was incredibly <UNK> of the <UNK> season when it aired the show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on one son and <UNK> and the <UNK> season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that <UNK> the barrel for ideas that were far fetched implausible or downright silly but i figured hey give it the benefit of a doubt maybe they're bringing it back because they've got some great ideas <UNK> up br br <UNK> really was <UNK> following patience which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire <UNK> that the show had done well to avoid the episode sees a strange alien <UNK> slug with the power of mind control <UNK> by a cult of backwoods christians oh and they think it's the second coming of christ but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes seriously there's never any attempt to make sense of this to explain what the slug is why anything that's happening is happening or anything even in the show's early years in fact especially then you could expect a little bit more depth a bit of background or if not that then the opposite a bit of mystery some <UNK> about what this was all about br br it's <UNK> that really kills it though you could put up with the silliness of the premise but to have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational <UNK> transformed into a <UNK> maverick purely for the sake of <UNK> the plot is bizarre to watch you feel like you're watching some <UNK> teen horror except that it's a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that she's spent the best part of a decade <UNK> the sinister <UNK> of being either <UNK> by very stereotypical <UNK> or utterly indifferent to her own safety oh and by the way <UNK> the new <UNK> isn't around <UNK> just <UNK> off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him he shows up at the end to save the day i can't even remember why but apart from that he's not really in it again seriously br br in short it feels like either a generic script written for another show or someone's pet movie project which they've been allowed to <UNK> like a mutant <UNK> into the spine of an existing long running show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable it <UNK> worked on a lesser show where the characters are more <UNK> and the audience expects less but the x files had a good thing going and <UNK> was one of the strongest and most <UNK> tv characters of the 90s deciding that you're going to change her personality for the sake of a story that they must've done on star trek a good fifty or so times is pointless
<START> of the ten actors who portrayed philo vance in the series edmund lowe seemed the most <UNK> but in this script the audience is way ahead of the famed detective after all when the <UNK> douglas <UNK> stares <UNK> in space obviously <UNK> and says something like i must ride and be killed i felt it was dumb that no one picked up on it after he does get killed the police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it after hated horse owner gene <UNK> gets shot and killed <UNK> <UNK> does the same thing saying she's going out to be killed and then <UNK> jumps off a bus i laughed when lowe finally yells i got it as though it were a revelation the guilty party however was cleverly <UNK> and there was considerable suspense generated when that party starts to <UNK> lowe to get him to jump off a roof
<START> my first exposure to whale music was the <UNK> album of the same name that i bought around 1993 i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album which remains in a prominent place in my collection was inspired by canadian author paul <UNK> book br br i picked up the book a few months later and <UNK> it an amazing read i have since re read the book numerous times each time finding some new element to <UNK> and his desire to complete the whale music br br i found the film in 1996 on video i haven't had a lot of good experiences with canadian film but this one worked for me the role of claire could have been cast differently but overall i think that paul <UNK> vision was <UNK> nicely from the book to the screen br br <UNK> <UNK> gives a moving performance as the isolated genius the movie deals with family relationships love and finding someone who understands i would strongly recommend whale music to not only music fans but anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to find their way back to the world
<START> this is one irresistible great cheerful and technically greatly made movie br br the movie features some of the greatest looking sets you'll ever see in a <UNK> movie even though it's all too obvious that they are sets rather than real place locations often if a character would fall or shake a <UNK> too aggressive the entire set would obviously move br br the best moments of the movie were the silent more old fashioned slapstick kind of moments it shows that <UNK> <UNK> true heart was at silent movie making the overall humor is really great in this movie also of course the musical moments were more than great this is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early french musical though the best moments are the silent moments that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog that gets very well delivered by the main actors who all seemed like stage actors to me which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no <UNK> atmosphere no wonder this worked out so well since this movie is actually based on stage play by georges <UNK> br br it's a technical really great movie with also some great <UNK> camera work in it and some really great editing that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences there is never a dull moment in this movie br br <UNK> <UNK> was such a clever director who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies it's a very creative made movie that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie that never <UNK> to entertain br br the last half hour is especially <UNK> fun without spoiling too much and is really among the greatest as well as most creative moments in early comedy film making br br the movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks it all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and <UNK> of the movie br br one of the most pleasant movies you'll ever see br br 8 10
<START> i'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars the line about have you even seen the wizard of oz was the best part for me with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a <UNK> baseball game your gonna be glad ya did
<START> this is just plain bad sometimes remakes even if they stray from the original are good on their own they can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable this was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be this wasn't any good even standing on it's own viggo <UNK> is a top notch actor but some of his <UNK> of roles and projects leaves something to be desired the original <UNK> point was such a thrilling psychological adventure this is not an adventure at all and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever this was made from a by the numbers approach to film making <UNK> in plot points that someone in hollywood believes will please what they see as today's film going audience basically they see us as a bunch of idiots it's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film and even attempt to remake a cult classic this <UNK> the manipulative plot devices the make it obvious so they don't miss the point aspects ridiculous dialogue stereotyped characters amateurish direction br br this is plain bad
<START> wow this was probably the worst <UNK> ever i watched the first half hour and i laughed brenda song plays wendy the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be <UNK> queen she is supposed to save the world as a warrior and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts shin teaches her the skills of a snake tiger etc and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world br br this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible br br brenda song is a comedic actress and i can't see her playing a serious role it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin shin couldn't act at all and everything was totally unbelievable br br i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar and the thing i came up with was the power rangers this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger esquire that it was just corny and stupid the characters weren't likable and i just couldn't stand to watch it disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel along with other movies like jumping ship color of friendship go figure read it and <UNK> stuck in the <UNK> br br if you like action adventure and corny jokes you'll like this movie
<START> it is cheese if all you want is a video game complete with what look like straight from the computer <UNK> sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for this is it my friend and i actually had a great time seeing it since the theatre was mostly empty and we could <UNK> a bit this movie really requires <UNK> br br plot there was a plot ok some stupid college or later types get invited to the rave of the year and go to one of the san juan islands if they'd only stayed back in seattle they would have survived direct quote or nearly to attend they get there and everyone is gone and the site is somewhat <UNK> but hey the <UNK> is still full with the help of a <UNK> old captain and a coast guard woman who acted only slightly less tough and slightly less well than <UNK> <UNK> they fight lots of zombies some which spit acid get an <UNK> of freaky legends and mostly get killed that's about it br br it's not quite as bad as <UNK> but not by much and still better than severed they are sort of my own personal <UNK> and <UNK> for bad movies the former is bad but fun to <UNK> and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once on the other hand if you're expecting a video game movie as excellent as resident evil run away run away now br br ok some real big questions without too many spoilers since when did spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the pacific <UNK> why is anyone in the pacific <UNK> <UNK> guns and to whom canada for crying out loud why is a rave on an <UNK> oh excuse me it's called <UNK> del <UNK> <UNK> right san juan island and <UNK> still keeping in mind this is the pacific <UNK> and the rave has about 30 people in <UNK> the rave of the year my <UNK> br br lucky thing there's lots of <UNK> around lots of them everyone has them must be a <UNK> sales <UNK> nearby br br finally while the movie started out playing with a little parody with <UNK> at i know what you did and jaws it didn't carry it through near enough br br ok really finally when the <UNK> comments in a voice over no less casually mention that one of the characters gave up her boyfriend to focus on her <UNK> you can be darn sure <UNK> be some <UNK> by the end of the movie not good <UNK> but a couple of people <UNK> at each other with swords anyway
<START> i thought it was a very funny movie i love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good k 9 k <UNK> and k 9 <UNK> are my favorite movies jim belushi is hysterical and jerry lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team the only downside is that i really didn't understand how <UNK> wife died she died before this movie but how if they said it i must have missed it other than that i give it two thumbs <UNK> up those dogs jerry lee and <UNK> must have had a lot of training they were so funny and all the noises jerry lee would make when <UNK> was talking to him was so funny my favorite was when jerry lee sang and when he would bite peoples <UNK> to get information very very funny lol
<START> this is a very engrossing bbc tv mini series which is loosely based upon a mysterious disappearance of a young mother but the series is really more of a study of the <UNK> characters in the story which lasts for five hours it is thus very much an ensemble piece where the wide variety of brilliant british actors and actresses can show off their talents the actual characters portrayed are really 'the kind of people one does not normally <UNK> people so boring and <UNK> that it is difficult to admire them for instance the lead character is a young husband the one whose wife disappears who has no job and no apparent interest in finding any he lives off <UNK> from his parents in law he was once in the army but does not appear to have the slightest <UNK> of any ambition or any interests in life apart from <UNK> on his small family he is played by david <UNK> who is brilliant at the part coming across as a totally sympathetic person although his only activities for five hours are loving and <UNK> which he does superbly so that one wants to comfort him as he is so obviously a nice guy the standout performance of the whole series is <UNK> penelope <UNK> who acts circles round everyone else in the story she is simply incredible she portrays a very unsympathetic woman indeed the only character in the story who is all too familiar to everyone namely an irrational hysterical self <UNK> dense <UNK> <UNK> loving and <UNK> hating elderly idiot woman alas alas we know them too well <UNK> is one of <UNK> finest actresses see my review of her in <UNK> broken <UNK> she takes a character who could have been two dimensional and makes her four dimensional she is wonderfully supported by old pro patrick <UNK> who plays her <UNK> husband and the pair of them set a high standard indeed for all the younger players janet <UNK> a spectacular actress when younger has become a much less sympathetic type of person now that she is older has <UNK> in some way and puts one off but she <UNK> herself in the latter stages of the story by showing how brilliant an actress she can be when she has a chance by pulling off one of the most convincing and original drunk scenes i have ever seen on film the big surprise is the enigmatic character sarah played with great depth and originality by actress sarah smart she takes a character who could have been <UNK> tedious and by sheer acting magic turns her into a deeply mysterious and intriguing person about whom we wonder <UNK> for the entire five hours she is so good at it that we end up wondering about sarah smart frankly i guess that's what happens when you really do your job properly that people wonder where the character ends and the actress begins if she knows herself that is and many do not she has some deeply unnerving tricks with her eyes which <UNK> and let us know she is unhinged but we are not sure how or why though we eventually learn that she had an extremely violent and traumatic childhood her <UNK> of ambiguous facial expressions is extraordinary <UNK> kinnear is amazingly convincing as an apparently hopeless fellow who lives with his mum and isn't up to much but who turns out to have hidden depths i suppose most people have hidden depths but do we want to <UNK> them that is the question his mum is played very well indeed by <UNK> <UNK> a superb performance is given by <UNK> <UNK> who plays a <UNK> revolting teenage girl of the sort we all dread to meet but who at crucial moments <UNK> in helpless tears and turns out to be pathetic with all her arrogance just a pose three other children are also very good <UNK> friend and her younger half brother and half sister the younger siblings may be very dim indeed as characters in the story they seem unable to say anything particularly <UNK> being hopeless witnesses to the disappearance with little to recommend them but their sweet <UNK> but that is conveyed to wonderful effect by lee massey as the boy and tyler anthony as the girl harriet walter has a small role but we do not get to see much of her which is a shame as she is such a fine actress that she was wasted here one could go on but one must draw a line somewhere the series manages to be strangely fascinating because of the depth of portrayal of all these essentially uninteresting people caught up in a web of intense anxiety and suspense
<START> ok i am not japanese i do know a little about japanese culture and a little less about japanese pop culture other than that i am spanish i eat <UNK> and i like black humor br br good with that point set i can comment on the movie i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences <UNK> <UNK> is quite a good director despite the overly <UNK> <UNK> stuff in the style of talking head and even that was curious and somehow interesting and i am surprised he came up with this it may just be one of those lost in translation cases i am afraid it is but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext <UNK> english subtitles i just thought it was horrible the jokes seemed bad the script was <UNK> i mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator to the point of almost making my head explode over an <UNK> of fast paced speaking and absurd action br br however i thought the animation was really cool the idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes however the eye candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all <UNK> <UNK> speech over still pictures it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut out hysterical characters scene br br i read <UNK> <UNK> is actually planning on a sequel for this the idea was good but horribly exploited maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more over narrated scenes but hell if you thought talking head was dense amazing <UNK> of fast food <UNK> will give cause you a stroke br br of course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european probably this is totally useless to japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural <UNK> and translation maybe
<START> this film was terrible i have given it the high score of 2 as i have seen worse but very few br br from the clichéd start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it like a kid with too many toys there was the endless boring repetitive narration slow motion freeze frame flashbacks and <UNK> images etc none of which made a dull film any better br br it is called 16 years of alcohol but there was little drinking or <UNK> and no depiction of <UNK> with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense the story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by mr <UNK> previously know for being in a rubbish group and on tv making as much sense as this film does br br i found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better i carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and i would have been better off not bothering
<START> i want so badly to give this piece of garbage a zero unfortunately there isn't so i had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how <UNK> terrible this <UNK> of a familiar cartoon really is the characters look like they were drawn by pre <UNK> no wait i've seen pre <UNK> do better i prefer <UNK> of <UNK> to this terrible excuse for a cartoon i'm probably saying what others have said two words rip off remember that episode of <UNK> lab when they <UNK> go <UNK> down that <UNK> yeah mister <UNK> even <UNK> in on that idea and failed they even ripped off shadow <UNK> in that one episode that <UNK> pokemon he even <UNK> in on that franchise that one character is a cheap rip off of <UNK> from <UNK> lab mister <UNK> needs to be <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> for this piece of crap everyone has their own opinion but those of you who like johnny rip off test <UNK> just lying to yourselves do yourself a favor change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen
<START> a so common horror story about a luxury building at brooklyn which hides the gates to hell it is reminiscent of <UNK> the tenant released a year before the sentinel but is too far from the movie of the polish filmmaker in any aspect possible the tenant was so disturbing whereas the sentinel is not at all br br what it's more surprising from this film is the cast it is full of great names of american cinema <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> veteran actors acting for food i guess br br verdict barely entertaining br br my rate 4 10
<START> i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so i went out and bought it what a mistake the acting is a <UNK> the special effects if you could call them that look like something that wouldn't be out of place at a school play some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often as for a story forget it this is a warning don't waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen if for some reason you like this film watch <UNK> 2 you will probably enjoy that as well
<START> the only film i've ever walked out on amazing since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being <UNK> on particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and <UNK> br br from the beginning to the end this film <UNK> worse it ain't funny it wasn't funny then and it sure ain't funny now but even worse is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart sophisticated comedy it's juvenile really <UNK> script and ideas began an era which continues to this day where cheap laughs and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film br br sexual <UNK> what high school kid hasn't thought of that the beginning of the end
<START> i remember <UNK> <UNK> to spain at 25 getting a lift from what turned out to be two fleeing italian small crooks they were doing a lot outside the law but from the other side carrying a little portrait of jesus in the pocket for their protection just and <UNK> good and bad criminal and correct where here in a new combination outside of the categories i used to know <UNK> <UNK> gives me although a film and not real life a picture close to my own experiences the <UNK> of each moment as soon as you leave <UNK> <UNK> and go for the <UNK> whatever comes your way it's another state of mind and also <UNK> form of life because as we all know there are people who are not ready for this and willing to <UNK> you for <UNK> and so on this film touches <UNK> it's a story about <UNK> right and <UNK> morals it's <UNK> of the individual fighting him herself free against the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> there's danger all the way because how far can you go with your own <UNK> and crossing your own moral borders and that of other people what to do with people who are willing to hurt you put you in jail or even shoot at you for the things that you do like stealing some <UNK> from a <UNK> oil company for you fifth hand car les <UNK> re <UNK> these questions in me because morality in <UNK> to the usual <UNK> <UNK> is quite complex
<START> ostensibly this is a z grade <UNK> horror film br br but with lines like br br it's easy to die i have many times br br and br br why are you reading that book because it makes the plot more interesting br br and br br you made your way in here now you can make your way out again after he leads a man into the basement br br and take a listen to what they <UNK> br br it's not that clear what this film made in the era known for post <UNK> is actually about or whether its just bad film making the acting is atrocious but some actors i know so are they <UNK> it up br br an old house cut obviously with a contemporary <UNK> is the site of murders a bad film is made in the grounds and the story <UNK> again
<START> this is one of the best of the genre i saw it twice about <UNK> ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then it rivals the zatoichi series also starring <UNK> in exciting <UNK>
<START> this interesting giallo <UNK> a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways br br directed by <UNK> p <UNK> who one year earlier also made the very interesting la <UNK> che evelyn <UNK> della <UNK> see also my comment on that one the film starts off a little slow but all in all no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences br br this film is a german italian <UNK> but it was released in germany on video only in a version <UNK> by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title horror house at least the murder scenes which will satisfy every <UNK> are fully intact and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of course br br a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to <UNK> above mentioned other thriller
<START> the person's comment that said that pat robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare what evil and righteous is his definition of evil is the opposite of evil the bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good he doesn't even know that he <UNK> bible prophecy if you don't know god and refuse to know him now that's okay he still loves you but when you do finally bow your <UNK> to him and you will it will be too late for you god sends no one to hell not even you you will go there of your own decision and your <UNK> <UNK> it may god have mercy on you and give you a <UNK> road experience the 700 club and pat <UNK> <UNK> is one of the reasons i'm still here on the edge of alcoholism adultery and probably death god reached through the tv screen and used pat robertson to do it and thank god he did you have a right to say what you said but you don't have a right to curse with your words god have mercy on you
<START> overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria <UNK> searching for her families secret past every take seems to last <UNK> there is really no rhythm in the film spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by <UNK> <UNK> the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin 40s something please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time  very annoying worst part is the end spoilers the entire show and <UNK> about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a <UNK> accident give me a break that's how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is <UNK> who freed them did lean <UNK> sleep with <UNK> in <UNK> the film won an acting award for k <UNK> why  i have no idea must be the jewish <UNK>
<START> john <UNK> finest film before blockbuster <UNK> like the <UNK> remake this is a thought provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters each with <UNK> <UNK> problems br br what i liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of <UNK> among young blacks a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social <UNK> problems and racism by whites this movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist br br the masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow it's not just about racism but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world college date rape discovering sexuality and isolation omar <UNK> michael <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> each deliver fine performances and the supporting cast is equally interesting with jennifer <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> and with ice cube and <UNK> <UNK> as college <UNK> causing little <UNK> br br the only negative is the caricature of a professor by laurence fishburne <UNK> surely plenty of <UNK> are nutty but they're not as flat the <UNK> are also a bit of a caricature but i guess they are like that too in real life br br overall a great underrated piece of <UNK> if you liked american history x you'll love this one br br 8 5 out of 10
<START> i view probably 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home and i can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst i have seen this year if not ever however i have not actually seen quest of the <UNK> knights yet this movie is just bad joke after bad joke <UNK> to the 13 year old and because i had he <UNK> of viewing it on a bus trip i couldn't walk out br br do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental <UNK> the four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by jerry bruckheimer
<START> this italian semi horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes the only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film the story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie <UNK> girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his <UNK> go <UNK> and seemingly kill them they show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her he has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business after a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes <UNK> and such at this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything <UNK> up not so nicely this movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film explaining <UNK> death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where evelyn did rise from the grave granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power the gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the <UNK> and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too i just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull
<START> this production never really got off the ground for me the plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless you've read the novel or seen a better adaptation like the 1995 one with amanda root you're going to be a bit lost since there's no time for character development br br i liked sally <UNK> as anne but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been mrs <UNK> was far too old as was <UNK> elder sister elizabeth mary <UNK> everything in such <UNK> accents that the general <UNK> and <UNK> of her character was lost much better was sophie <UNK> mary whose <UNK> and sense of ill usage is so well established that by the time <UNK> suggests anne stay with the injured <UNK> and mary objects that she as <UNK> sister in law should stay instead you can't imagine anyone less suited to do so in this version she might as well stay as she is <UNK> <UNK> from anyone else in the production br br rupert <UNK> jones is nice to look at but he made a much better st john rivers 1995 jane eyre probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling i agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene seemed more like he was trying to get rid of anne than do her a favor likewise the accident scene it happens so fast and with so little context you wonder what all the fuss is about and moving the speech that <UNK> <UNK> in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical <UNK> that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script br br my other problem with this version was the lighting sometimes everything looked like a scene from the <UNK> <UNK> very very blue other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well like when anne visits her old school friend mrs smith who by the way is supposed to be more or less <UNK> having her run up to anne on the street to tell her of mr <UNK> awful character was such a <UNK> that for a minute i couldn't think who she was i thought she was one of the <UNK> girls and she might as well have been all the girls were pretty much <UNK> and the running scene at the end in an era where <UNK> was at a <UNK> it's hard to imagine gentle anne <UNK> all over bath like some demented <UNK> how silly can you get it's too bad sally <UNK> had all the <UNK> of a good anne elliot but she was completely <UNK> by a poorly organized script and an over <UNK> production
<START> rich in love is a slice of life film which takes the viewer into the goings on of a somewhat quirky <UNK> <UNK> family highly <UNK> beautifully shot well written and acted <UNK> <UNK> over you like a summer <UNK> as its <UNK> meandering <UNK> life into the characters such that at film's end you'll feel like an old friend of the family br br a wonderfully crafted character driven film from the director of driving miss daisy <UNK> is a somewhat obscure little sleeper which will appeal most to mature audiences
<START> halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child he takes out his problems on his older sister whom he murders at the beginning of the film this is just the start of things to come from michael myers br br donald <UNK> plays the doctor who's been studying myers for years he knows that something is different about him something mysteriously evil this evil will not be contained and it cannot be stopped br br after an escape from an institution myers tracks down his younger sister if he kills her there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs br br there have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting <UNK> to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer but this one started it all sort of if you think about it most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy <UNK> or jason chasing around half naked girls well if it wasn't for halloween those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children br br <UNK> director john carpenter got a lot out of the horror movies of the <UNK> and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s this films <UNK> him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer br br this film may seem cliché today but back then there wasn't much out there like this it's been copied from and ripped off of but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie it still gives you chills listening to carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers
<START> i really didn't expect much from this film seeing as it has people from <UNK> <UNK> which is were i live acting in it this town is dull and so is this film there were a few decent <UNK> in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy <UNK> they made a point to show this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn't any unless you are from <UNK> and are interested in seeing what you see everyday then stay away from this movie the dialog will put you to sleep the acting will bore you to tears and steven <UNK> should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this its a predictable movie with no surprises what you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of <UNK> west virginia and <UNK> <UNK> without a narrator
<START> for a slasher flick this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre yes it is predictable resident nut job goes on killing spree people die <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however there are some good <UNK> in this film first off i really liked the mask the nut job wore it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique although i haven't watched every single slasher film ever made also the <UNK> of the bad due is something i haven't seen before and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept as far as i know i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr <UNK> for most of the murders the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre but <UNK> small concern the movie does not take itself seriously which is something most slashers suffer from oddly enough while watching the movie i was reminded of the early friday the 13th films which did take themselves seriously there are a few concerns about this movie in several scenes the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons by this i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot and also the way he walked of bigger concern however is a scene very close to the end where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance actually a complete rip off of another famous horror <UNK> and in the very last scenes we have our <UNK> once again looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip off from another icon in the slasher genre these scenes were weak and unoriginal obviously by the way the movie is set in australia so if you're a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent like me you'll be in heaven if you not than it just might <UNK> on you one other great thing about this movie beautiful <UNK> <UNK> just don't get too attached to her there is one non aussie accent courtesy of molly <UNK> overall there are more reasons to watch than not i enjoyed it and had some fun so i have to give cut 8 10 which may seem too high to some people
<START> i really can't remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films it is certainly a strange one like <UNK> at a highway accident br br someone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see i really can't understand how a <UNK> account of this documentary is to be released this year how can you improve on this the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the <UNK> in the process they become <UNK> and what is best described as crazy cat ladies they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to <UNK> the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie this film was done after that rescue all during you couldn't help but think how bad was it before it's a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating
<START> <UNK> not surprised that even <UNK> get the blues if this movie is anything to go by i expected something better from uma thurman which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality it´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews this movie deserves it
<START> i had no idea what this movie was until i read about it in the l a weekly i generally agree with the reviews in the la weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film the film stars molly parker from my favorite television show <UNK> and lukas <UNK> who i suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future the film is funny heartwarming features great acting and beautiful photography i don't know if the film has distribution but i hope it does or will soon this is destined to be a real indie gem it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening even without her there this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival
<START> what a disappointment <UNK> <UNK> is adorable <UNK> banks is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and the talented and beautiful maria <UNK> is wasted <UNK> must have been embarrassed by some of the lines the plot script and premise is a joke br br i'm not against silly movies i think that something about mary is a masterpiece but <UNK> ugly is a waste of 90 minutes
<START> as far as spaghetti westerns go i'd put this man can't die on the dull side of the genre it's not that the movie is particularly bad but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other <UNK> i've seen guy madison does his best in the lead role but lacks the on screen charisma necessary to pull it off with one notable exception the rest of the cast isn't particularly good the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before there's just not much to get very excited about br br the cast exception i mentioned is <UNK> <UNK> she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film unfortunately her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes note the imdb page for this man can't die is wrong <UNK> <UNK> does not play jenny benson instead she is the character <UNK> i'm not sure how anyone could mistake <UNK> <UNK> for some guy named john <UNK> as listed in <UNK> credits for the movie
<START> this movie is incredible with great characters specially the old <UNK> that can fly in the shape of <UNK> and jump across the trees this film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evil the final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool br br very very <UNK> not for the smallest children though this one deserves a 10
<START> when anyone comes into a film of this type of film it's not without saying that an <UNK> of that great over the counter brain medicine suspension of disbelief comes in mighty handy br br <UNK> macdonald plays two roles anna <UNK> the woman who nelson eddy has ignored since the beginning of time but who also is an angel sent to earth br br my reaction when i saw this was a mute gasp of <UNK> where have i seen this before it turns out i have seen it before but in a movie made much later than this one date with an angel a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987 <UNK> in on the <UNK> beauty of one <UNK> <UNK> who had no speaking lines also wore a blond wig and made life hell for soap actor michael knight much worse in every <UNK> angle with ultra low 80s values but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey br br anyway not to elaborate this is not a memorable film and stands as a <UNK> of information because it was the last time macdonald and eddy neither very good actors but terrific singers would be together playing up the innocence and clean cut romance that they were known for after that you may need a cold shower not because there are any steamy scenes here but to get rid of the memory
<START> deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn every single turn in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film and it often doesn't make any sense although they do usually catch you by surprise the story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters but you can't catch all the development because of the twists the performances particularly by caine are amazing the direction is very good sidney lumet can direct the visual effects are fair but than again most are actually in a play and are fake twists way to much but still works and is worth watching
<START> john <UNK> of inspector morse fame plays old tom <UNK> in this movie tom lives in a tiny english village during 1939 and the start of the second world war a bit of a <UNK> tom has not yet <UNK> from the death of his wife and son while he was serving during the first world war if you can imagine inspector morse old and retired twice as <UNK> as when he was a policeman then you've got tom <UNK> character br br yet this heart of <UNK> is about to melt london children are <UNK> in advance of the <UNK> young william willie <UNK> is <UNK> with the <UNK> tom willie is played to good effect by nick robinson br br this boy is in need of care with a capital c behind in school still <UNK> the bed and unable to read are the smallest of his problems he comes from a horrific background in london with a mother who cannot cope to put it mildly br br slowly yet <UNK> man and boy warm to each other tom discovers again his ability to love and care and the boy learns to accept this love and caring see tom and willie building a bomb shelter at the end of their garden see <UNK> joy at what is probably his first ever birthday party thrown by tom br br not to give away the ending but willie is adopted by tom after much struggle and the pair begin a new life much <UNK> for their mutual love br br in this movie <UNK> and robinson are following in a long line of movies where man meets boy and develop a mutual love see the late <UNK> <UNK> and jon <UNK> in spanish <UNK> or clark gable and <UNK> <UNK> in it started in <UNK> or robert <UNK> and kenny <UNK> in <UNK> courageous or mel gibson and nick <UNK> in man without a face br br two points of interest this is the only appearance of <UNK> that i know of where he sings only a <UNK> of a <UNK> new <UNK> but he does sing br br second young robinson also starred in a second movie featuring tom in the title <UNK> midnight garden which is based on a classic children's novel
<START> obnoxious eva longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice <UNK> of an angel without wings falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her she is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex boyfriend with his new girlfriend a psychic who can see her br br obvious unoriginal movie wouldn't be bad in a clichéd sort of way except that <UNK> character is hateful and obnoxious that she <UNK> all of the fun out of the film its like having your ears <UNK> with <UNK> to be fair longoria nor anyone else in the cast or crew isn't the problem its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings its just really really stupid
<START> before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille <UNK> life really was it had it's great moments too but i didn't realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly <UNK> it
<START> this story is beautifully acted it is both sad and heartwarming about a young girl's journey to discover where she has come from and where she is going stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car crash and ever since she has been labeled the <UNK> <UNK> she is <UNK> and is finding life a bit tough her <UNK> along the way affect those closest around her her relationship with her guardian and her <UNK> ex boyfriend are handled very <UNK> and <UNK> and the whole of the supporting cast are genuine 3 dimensional and believable set around a <UNK> <UNK> factory in small town australia this is a warm gentle erotic film and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits close after reading some of the other rather shallow comments about hugo <UNK> i would like to add that i think he was brilliantly cast and was extremely sexy no he is not brad pitt but that doesn't mean that he isn't attractive
<START> i have to admit right off the top i'm not a big fan of family films these days most of them imho are sentimental crap but this one like toy story the previous film from pixar is a lot of fun the two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland especially compared to the two leads in <UNK> but otherwise this film is better but the rest of the film more than made up for it the animation looked great the humor though broad was consistently good i especially liked <UNK> line if i hadn't promised mother on her <UNK> that i wouldn't kill you i would kill you and the actors doing the voices except the two leads were all terrific denis <UNK> doing an animated movie what a concept and like everyone else i loved the <UNK> i hope the video has the new ones
<START> it gets really bad the only half way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film there are context errors everywhere the acting is horrible save kirk the story is as <UNK> as the grail and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie if it wasn't already a corpse so all in all it's a waste of your life i would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale
<START> <UNK> alone <UNK> is the first of the home alone movies not to feature culkin in the main role and the same villains however the plot is very similar to the original <UNK> <UNK> film instead of two comical villains we get three or four of them this film involves some traps but it also has a long scene with a remote control car the slapstick humour is consistent as well but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film no pun intended this film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did and there really is not the warm holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had it's more of a pure comedy but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me i would not recommend this film it's pretty boring if you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy then watch the original <UNK> <UNK> movie
<START> note to self just because a film is foreign obscure and stars catherine zeta jones doesn't mean it's any good such is the case with <UNK> juice ' a 1995 brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing <UNK> in what would seem to a dumb american anyway an even more unlikely place to find surfers <UNK> england you might be thinking this has the <UNK> for an amusing quirky little comedy if only the film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable the <UNK> way to describe it is as a sort of <UNK> british version of <UNK> without the dancing but even that makes it sound better than it is no the best way to take it is as a little slice of life set in a small town catherine zeta jones plays chloe a young woman living with a surfing <UNK> <UNK> sean pertwee you remember him pertwee is actually the film's star and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing <UNK> the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this in this case it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer and a fat nerdy guy who in a needlessly extended scene gets stoned and loses all his <UNK> which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him i can't honestly say everything that goes on in <UNK> <UNK> is predictable since it's set in a place and reflects customs and manners i'm not very familiar with but there's certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters the comedy though is very predictable and tired one can sense the set ups a mile away and almost <UNK> the dialogue in american form of course before the actors do the relationship between <UNK> and chloe is every bit as hackneyed she wants him to grow up he wants them to stay the <UNK> teenagers they started out being he's afraid of losing face with his gang she thinks he prefers them to her you get the idea as i <UNK> to stay focused on <UNK> juice ' toward the end i felt as the saying goes that this was an hour and half of my life i'd never get back
<START> okay i'll admit it i am a goof ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy while i have seen more films by kurosawa bergman and <UNK> than practically anyone on the planet i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail <UNK> start the revolution without me strange <UNK> and the bill and ted movies they all lack <UNK> appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them br br while bill ted's bogus journey isn't as wonderful as the original bill and ted film it still is great fun also unlike the original it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs but every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments particularly those involving the grim <UNK> and by the way this <UNK> is about as different from <UNK> in the seventh seal as you can get in addition to a lot of laughs this film features some excellent music one way that it's actually better than the first film the kiss <UNK> at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes provided you aren't an old <UNK> like de <UNK> great viewing for kids and adults alike
<START> this is the first 10 out of 10 that i've given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action there isn't any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the <UNK> and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all <UNK> of the public i e there's no forced romance br br i liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this one br br warning after watching this movie you will be full of <UNK> and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
<START> this is only a response to the <UNK> who says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre defining masterpiece jaws yes <UNK> great whites and other species of shark bull black tip <UNK> white tip tiger have been known to <UNK> areas where easy prey is found humans don't often make it onto that menu granted but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be <UNK> <UNK> behavior it's not like it's never happened the odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town <UNK> out a human nemesis sinking several dozen thick <UNK> north atlantic fishing <UNK> and knowing when certain people all friends of the aforementioned nemesis are close enough to the water for it to reach are so slim as to be laughable much like this turd of a jaws knock off laughable great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on <UNK> protective underwater <UNK> and people on <UNK> and <UNK> as they look like <UNK> from below a shark the size of bruce if you don't know look it up would be more than capable of sinking a boat like the <UNK> hey that's the name of the blatant rip off we're discussing as it would <UNK> <UNK> of 6 000 <UNK> i could go on but i don't need to jaws is amazing better acting better effects better music better writing <UNK> is crap blatant rip off of jaws lousy writing <UNK> effects most ridiculous plot this side of an <UNK> twins flick it doesn't take a masters from columbia university to see that watch better movies
<START> it's interesting that all who so far seemed to like this film had no expectations i guess that's the trick in contrast with them i had optimistic expectations and that was a mistake as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director that's always a clear sign of them they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two <UNK> away from the actors the actors in this film though had only one facial expression each br br if the close camera wasn't enough the lack of light in the film killed it the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur as well <UNK> <UNK> we're going to light the set with a <UNK> that will make it all seem intimate no that made it all seem invisible br br on top of the serious technical flaws there was absolutely no story beyond the <UNK> hint of an idea that was never developed and nothing new about this kind of relationship was <UNK> perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany but in los angeles forget about it br br the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film but <UNK> the quality of these particular festivals i can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where i saw it in fact two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave this was one of the side effects of the <UNK> total darkness technique but when the film <UNK> on instead there were <UNK> coming from the audience and once the movie finally did end it was clear that it hadn't <UNK> if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of <UNK> <UNK> sheets cutting <UNK> <UNK> honey on bread yeah we get it the life of the lonely old man was boring but we figured that one out at the very beginning br br i recommend that audiences miss this one it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie goers
<START> for a film with so much promise it was disappointing <UNK> plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable the plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it's the worst clichéd ending i've seen in a movie for some time the final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadn't been so painful to begin with i was <UNK> from the very first scene one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i've seen to date it was a horror in the true sense of the word
<START> this must be one of the worst movies i have ever seen i was actually expecting a bad movie but i was caught by surprise believe it or not the storyline is the traditional all <UNK> are included br br the dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half descent actors are trying to make it sound real the photo is not too good the music is so <UNK> it actually made me angry the actors are not even trying <UNK> the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the action itself br br i dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming who is <UNK> this <UNK> where is the screening and why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script br br there are a million hollywood movies in this genre without even <UNK> of reaching the theaters but even them straight to video things actually manages to look professional in comparison br br i can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all i feel robbed of 2 hours of my life
<START> i think that that creator s of this film's concept deserves a lot more <UNK> than they probably ever received it isn't an oscar caliber film of course but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 in the theatre br br i don't think this is and hope it isn't a spoiler but imagine acting on your <UNK> doing the first thought that pops into your head saying the first words on your lips no restraint no conscious nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that as intelligent adults we know we shouldn't actually say or do if anything this film only <UNK> the surface it doesn't go as far as it could go br br in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with <UNK> older classics to try and cash in on today wouldn't it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success for the sake of taking it to the next level a bit further or even to explore what the original crew didn't wouldn't or couldn't deal with 20 years ago br br that's just my opinion anyway o
<START> the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with <UNK> i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some <UNK> that were never resolved during the series thanks to nbc it was great to see <UNK> and <UNK> together at their most human and most basic persons <UNK> and <UNK> did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on <UNK> just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot
<START> the first time i saw this film i loved it it was different br br i am a christian bible believing i don't go along with the crowd of right wing <UNK> i dropped out of that atmosphere br br to me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what <UNK> tried to do i call it the <UNK> syndrome br br <UNK> didn't get it even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this world br br this film certainly showed some of that br br i also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his <UNK> br br also he was a very gorgeous jesus br br it's a watch over and over movie br br very satisfying
<START> i pity people calling kamal <UNK> <UNK> maybe for them <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> guys this movie is a thriller without thrill br br come out of your <UNK> and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the <UNK> br br technically good but style over substance kamal doesn't look like a police officer there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving 3 valuable <UNK> of your life if u skip watching this movie br br kamal at his best is the best in <UNK>
<START> as usual on imdb going by the majority vote instead of the <UNK> average is far more <UNK> of the movie's entertainment value in this case the majority gives it a one how right they are to start my review i'll first admit that i am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled alien intruder it does involve space and even an alien i suppose but there's no rhyme or reason at all for anything in the long run at least no actual plot basis or resolution that i can make out anywhere br br there are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious with regard to both the lines the timing and how they are spoken that it far <UNK> the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies i have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic bugs bunny seems to be <UNK> about something br br the plot solely involves an area of space known as the g spot sorry make that g <UNK> and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien virus i think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal ariel appears as a <UNK> negative br br for most of the movie we see people getting shot with space weapons falling out of <UNK> and seemingly endless pointless close shots of where's ariel can't find ariel pointless because most of the other shots include interaction with ariel anyway whatever on a computer <UNK> commander <UNK> billy dee sits and watches each fantasy of the <UNK> <UNK> programs hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it or maybe i missed something br br billy dee williams took a few <UNK> on how to act in despair prior to the filming of this we know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking <UNK> br br the <UNK> scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semi hilarious at least and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle looking much like a <UNK> experiment gone awry br br it seems everyone dies in this movie so why bother even the <UNK> females get killed as if that is supposed to mean anything especially since everyone else dies anyway outrageous br br because of the money i save on <UNK> i won't rant about wanting my money back that i paid for the dvd of this the dollar that i saved on that bag of vanilla <UNK> paid for this <UNK> time br br i'll just add that the story itself at least as a novel and with far more detail added could probably be quite interesting with the right author br br 1 10
<START> without effective <UNK> of the supernatural or the poetic <UNK> nuances of humanity all this creative team has to hope for is effective usage of its <UNK> unoriginal elements <UNK> of <UNK> gone <UNK> then <UNK> <UNK> there's little rooting interest because the <UNK> non homicidal element is a second rate bland awful acting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in fact all of the acting is skin deep even though the dark haired women appeal the <UNK> is kept to a minimum no nudity here also lacking are sufficient <UNK> of blood all <UNK> are kept at a <UNK> safe distance an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is <UNK> ' only the soundtrack the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> country and the tense <UNK> score provide any <UNK> tension sometimes some static <UNK> compositions add appealing low angles that adds to the <UNK> but for a film that calls itself horror i did not even get close to <UNK> once perhaps a greater emphasis on societal <UNK> through blood <UNK> scenes directed with varying <UNK> <UNK> outside the square and a <UNK> focus on <UNK> through the family's <UNK> or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion but this was not a good start to my <UNK> through <UNK>
<START> farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama where she plays <UNK> a woman who manages to escape the <UNK> of a would be rapist well done to farrah for being a golden globe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br when her rapist joe <UNK> played by james russo comes into her home which she shares with her two roommates who are conveniently out <UNK> has to play along with <UNK> frightening demands it does make for some disturbing and shocking images br br when her roommates come home they are <UNK> to say the least by <UNK> actions and a great performance by <UNK> <UNK> who desperately tries to convince <UNK> to do the right thing and turn him into the police makes the film even more nail biting br br i do find diana <UNK> quite irritating but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed br br overall <UNK> is a brilliantly thought out and well acted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now well done to everybody involved
<START> this is a truly magnificent and <UNK> film <UNK> locations are spectacular extremely detailed and well lit the dialogue is extraordinarily <UNK> <UNK> no doubt about it <UNK> <UNK> and marisa <UNK> give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife br br you must see it
<START> this is the only film i've seen that is made by uwe boll i knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that house of the dead is one of imdb bottom 100 but i still wanted to watch it because i'm a huge fan of the game and i wanted to see what <UNK> the film have that makes it so bad after watching it i do agree that it is crap the movie had no story in the first 15 20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about for a moment there i was wondering are the zombies brain dead or the girls are then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere started attacking people later a woman started shooting them i mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes is it supposed to be a comedy or horror or both before i knew it i fell asleep at the second half woke up during the end credits so i did not manage to watch all of it which is a good thing the film is a true insult to the classic game uwe boll please do not make any more films thank you
<START> as far as i can tell you in spite of earlier comments posted by other <UNK> this film is currently available on dvd i found it only a few weeks ago br br it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it i found it at a 98 <UNK> store among <UNK> of plastic <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> now don't you people who <UNK> out beau coup bucks for the super <UNK> swedish <UNK> limited edition version feel like you were had i thought so br br this film was indeed well worth 98 cents 99 cents i might start to argue with you but clearly worth 98 cents and remember that saying about getting what you pay for for slasher film <UNK> only
<START> routine suspense yarn about a <UNK> dillon who gives his <UNK> to a clinic of human <UNK> and starts to <UNK> the lives of the woman <UNK> and his husband <UNK> extremely predictable far fetched and with <UNK> tone all the way don't lose your time with this one make a baby instead
<START> mystery men has got to be the stupidest film i've ever seen but what a film i thought it was fabulous excellent and impressive it was funny well done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for a change and being able to pull it off this was great i'll definitely watch it again
<START> i bought this movie because this was shah rukh <UNK> debut and i also liked to see how would he do i must say he is excellent in his role <UNK> <UNK> is superb in this movie <UNK> does a wonderful job <UNK> seth supported well <UNK> <UNK> was good in his role <UNK> and <UNK> did their parts well too <UNK> also was good in his small role actors shine in a mediocre movie the direction is average the editing is poor the story is boring it tells us about <UNK> a famous pop singer he has a lot of female fans one of them is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> fall in love and get married <UNK> gets killed by his cousins <UNK> <UNK> a widow to escape from <UNK> cousins they go to <UNK> she comes across <UNK> she falls in love with him and gets married <UNK> returns the story is predictable the climax is predictable the first half <UNK> it also drags a lot but it is saved by the actors and music the second half entertains the music is catchy with some nice songs the cinematography looks outdated in the first half but it looks unimaginative the song <UNK> are dull except for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and one rain song the costumes are outdated any way watch this just for the actors and music rating 4 10
<START> remember the chain smoking <UNK> exposed on 60 minutes a few years ago this is her lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the <UNK> <UNK> of the filmmakers the producers have been using phony word of mouth <UNK> very successfully without <UNK> the financial and philosophical <UNK> for this piece of marketing tripe if you believe in <UNK> reincarnation new age dreck and day old <UNK> this film is for you if you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality look elsewhere the purpose of this movie is to convince you that <UNK> isn't a <UNK> so you'll give her a bunch of your money if you can <UNK> through the <UNK> website without howling in disbelief then maybe you'll think the bucks you dropped on this <UNK> for insanity was well spent http <UNK> <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> section category <UNK>
<START> this movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing american <UNK> actor one that believes his work and politics are as crucial to the american people as the opinions of the president himself alan bates captures this mindset perfectly as michael <UNK> and i will <UNK> remember bates as this character this is a movie for <UNK> and americans alike it is a valuable piece of cinema that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and <UNK> outside forces wonderfully hollywood north does not suffer from the subject that it portrays peter <UNK> directs with <UNK> and complete control and <UNK> both the serious <UNK> the <UNK> portion of the movie and the movie within the movie flight to <UNK> with clarity and insight if you are at all interested in the wit and strength of canadian cinema hollywood north is a great place to start
<START> i believe a lot of people down rated the movie not because of the lack of quality but it did not follow the standard hollywood formula some of the conflicts are not resolved the ending is just a little too real for others but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting the directing also is excellent and innovative br br this is a 10 in my book this movie will take you places the normal and expected hollywood script will not they took some risks and did a few things different i think it worked well i am <UNK> trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer not accepting someone else's interpretation
<START> i have to admit that by moments i had to laugh at how bad that movie was but the laughs were too few and since this whole thing was in no way a parody it felt more like an insult to the viewer's intelligence the worst acting i have ever seen from any of these people
<START> i've read one comment which labeled this film trash and a waste br br of time i think this person got their political <UNK> <UNK> a bit br br too much br br i just rented the new <UNK> dvd's of both yellow and blue br br these films although hardly great have at least become of br br historical interest as to the so called radical student br br political social movement of the late '60s br br i hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation i br br was expecting some real porn there isn't any there is frontal br br nudity including the still <UNK> frontal male nudity automatic br br <UNK> 17 the <UNK> x in the u s but i wasn't expecting the films br br in your face <UNK> <UNK> message br br though it tends to the simplistic i thought it <UNK> made br br its points well both films <UNK> had me laughing out loud br br and the director's commentary made it clear there was plenty of br br parody in the film especially the supposedly pornographic sex br br scenes the first such scene is very realistic the lead couple is br br clumsy inept funny and endearing in their first <UNK> scene br br the second which caused the most complaints has <UNK> br br <UNK> and <UNK> and the last is the end of an angry fight br br that is believable br br the extras include an informative introduction to the film an br br interview with the original american <UNK> and his attorney br br <UNK> from trial <UNK> in the u s and a diary commentary br br by the director on some scenes br br this is the film that blue <UNK> wouldn't let alone and led to the br br pivotal <UNK> interest with no social redeeming value standard br br that thankfully still stands br br those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must br br see
<START> <UNK> <UNK> after the failure of <UNK> <UNK> 1998 returned with this film br br the film has govinda in 8 9 roles as his father mother grandfather sister and later on he also has <UNK> br br he in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get <UNK> against his wife whose photos he <UNK> at the airport while <UNK> with <UNK> br br he <UNK> as a <UNK> in the plane and again as a girl the funny part is how easily and in short time he does that br br then he <UNK> as a french singer and enters a tv to get <UNK> lol and then as a <UNK> yes inside the tv itself br br the rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note there are some funny scenes like govinda being <UNK> by an african and also many other portions br br direction by <UNK> <UNK> is okay music is okay br br amongst actors govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors he as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6 7 roles don't actually fit in the film <UNK> looks fat teams up well with govinda <UNK> it she is nothing great and kept doing such type of roles amongst rest <UNK> <UNK> is as usual <UNK> <UNK> is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and <UNK> as the older <UNK> <UNK> is okay <UNK> <UNK> is hilarious <UNK> is okay <UNK> is okay
<START> ten years after the first movie james belushi one of the most gifted and over looked light comedic actors of the last twenty years returns as detective <UNK> for this movie br br if you are expecting more of the same from the first movie you will be disappointed but this is still a good movie realizing that all the dog vs man battle of <UNK> scenarios had probably been used up in the first movie this one turns slightly more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with a <UNK> with <UNK> recently deceased wife after she rejected his book and blames <UNK> for her death br br the script may not be the best but the movie allows both belushi and christine <UNK> to show their good acting ability while still <UNK> enough of the light humour of the first movie to make it work and the chemistry between the two stars is there for all to see br br an easy light going movie which while maybe not worth a purchase unless you are a true fan of either the first movie or belushi <UNK> worth a watch when it comes on tv br br
<START> i like many other bachchan fans having been eagerly awaiting the remake of sholay this movie was not it thank god they didn't let them use the name sholay in the movie title ram <UNK> remake is not worthy of the title the camera work the locations the costumes the totally out of place dancing the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie i have ever seen you wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and ram <UNK> was paying a lot of money for the cast the only non paid actor the <UNK> was the only resemblance to the first movie <UNK> role was totally ridiculous did he need money to pay for the wedding to ash save your money your mind and your time don't bother with this movie or the dvd when that comes out
<START> dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted <UNK> film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong <UNK> island is a work of art i hope it should have <UNK> best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no <UNK> i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever
<START> i love this show it's sure to be a winner jessica alba does a great job it's about time we have a kick ass girl who's not the <UNK> type the entire cast is wonderful and all the <UNK> have good plots everything is <UNK> out well and thought over to put it together must have taken a while because it wasn't someone in a hurry that just slapped something together it's a great show altogether
<START> there are two distinct ways to enjoy this <UNK> written <UNK> tv show the godfather to x files and buffy etc as a monster show it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid or as a well written acted <UNK> film noir it works on both levels the <UNK> may have been <UNK> over the years it was made in the mid 70s but i was pleasantly surprised upon <UNK> the show via dvd that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons the late darren <UNK> is karl kolchak an eccentric <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> monster hunter who in pursuit of a story always finds a supernatural angle much to the pain of <UNK> over <UNK> put upon boss tony vincenzo played with tremendous world <UNK> by the also late great simon <UNK> you can practically feel the pain of his budding <UNK> the interplay between these characters is <UNK> and witty much like star <UNK> spock and mccoy only more <UNK> over the course of two pilot tv movies and a one season series <UNK> fought vampires robots werewolves witches zombies government <UNK> aliens and ancient legends sounds like the entire 9 <UNK> run of the x files in one season and kolchak did it first and as for composer <UNK> <UNK> cool partly <UNK> main title music well x files creator chris carter calls mike <UNK> very similar x files main title theme an <UNK> ' both themes work well leave it at that and unlike many modern horror sci fi shows most of <UNK> monsters are shown in shadow and in quick cuts effectively and sometimes thankfully as some of them do not hold up to modern <UNK> but some still do modern horror shows take note less is more one of the few flaws of the show and it's a small one is the over use of sunny california locales passing for <UNK> city chicago night gallery had the same issue <UNK> for a modest budget l a based show and some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are now viewed as clichés the <UNK> reporter ron <UNK> always used for comic relief sweet old lady advice <UNK> emily but they all do have their moments to shine unlike many supporting tv characters since cliché or not kolchak is a timeless show that serves as a <UNK> for many that followed and carl kolchak is one of the <UNK> characters ever written for a horror genre tv show agent <UNK> real dad and as a <UNK> i tried watching a few episodes of the new re imagining of the show it's an x files clone a copy of a copy and a bad one at that carl kolchak is now a model pretty <UNK> 30 something played <UNK> by a boring stuart <UNK> and giving him a <UNK> type partner is also a lame idea it <UNK> kolchak as a lone don <UNK> <UNK> and kolchak and vincenzo getting along where's the tension the interplay that they chose to hang the kolchak name on this <UNK> bit <UNK> crap is a prime example of how not to do a remake take a beloved cult series <UNK> off everything unique about it drain it of all character and color but keep the name need that cult <UNK> and <UNK> instant re <UNK> it gets an <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this new version deserved the axe stick with the short lived but classic original it truly gets better with age
<START> a wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of <UNK> parker posey plays fay grim as a sexy vulnerable loving mother who may or may not be what she seems the story is very tongue in cheek and the dialog <UNK> understated hints of humor and intrigue neither of which <UNK> the characterization posey pulls off so well the supporting cast is stellar the downside this film needs your full attention almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes posey has more sex appeal in her <UNK> of an <UNK> than most actresses have in their entire body she's worth your time even if you don't understand the denouement
<START> a good film and one i'll watch a number of times rich the previous <UNK> is right there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards and i have to wonder how much has suffered in translation were there more in the original or was a native language audience expected to lip read more or since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar in short very worth a look but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original <UNK> audience had to put into it br br the <UNK> video release <UNK> the new <UNK> score but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way sure it starts <UNK> but <UNK> into a repetitive phillip glass like <UNK> that reflects nothing of the action on the screen after listening for a while i turned off the sound and simply watched much better
<START> i just did not enjoy this film but then i loved babe a pig in the city and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way the animals were not likeable they were all irritating especially chris <UNK> guinea pig but then what could i expect it's chris rock i believe i <UNK> once or twice at a couple cute lines but that's it
<START> in a movie that follows a struggling actor played evidently by a struggling actor this does no <UNK> for chris <UNK> he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and <UNK> on through the shallow script managing to display what could only be described as a bland leading man the story exists but that is all and fails to show any basic start middle and end and the viewer is left <UNK> his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened br br one bright light in the midst of this is fred <UNK> who manages to stand out above his seemingly <UNK> talented co stars and does a semi decent job of bringing the <UNK> character of <UNK> to life whether fred can re create this when working with a higher <UNK> of cast remains to be seen but <UNK> be watching out for him in future
<START> i felt this movie was as much about human sexuality as anything else whether intentionally or not we are also shown how absurd and <UNK> it is for women not to be allowed to such a <UNK> important event meanwhile forgetting the <UNK> of our respective advanced nations i write from japan where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago and female technical <UNK> are a recent phenomenon <UNK> in england were once all male the business world was totally off limits for women in america until rather recently and women in china had their feet bound so they couldn't develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another back to the issue of sexuality we are made to wonder what it may be <UNK> about women that make them <UNK> for a soccer game the official reason is that the men are bad especially such <UNK> girls a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that <UNK> is on the agenda as well i think one point is that not all women are the same and the women the police are trying to protect are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place the opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the <UNK> of the young women trying to get in and each one <UNK> at all it is a <UNK> man's world any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed the world of sexuality is not one size fits all br br meanwhile the <UNK> criminal girls bond inside the <UNK> pen awaiting their <UNK> to who knows where and in a much more subtle way begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them these had definite ideas about women and <UNK> which were being challenged head on the change in attitude is <UNK> but visible br br since the movie is pure iran from the first moment it takes a little <UNK> into for the <UNK> but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you and you end up getting the whole picture and even understanding the men's <UNK> and give them slack the supposed villain is the unseen <UNK> of the <UNK> which remain unseen and <UNK> and likely <UNK> br br knowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the iran <UNK> match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved
<START> my <UNK> <UNK> certainly is a fair looking woman this film is a lost gem a dead on satire <UNK> of the early 90's hip hop scene when <UNK> hammer had just began to fade away into that good night we follow the three members of the <UNK> as they <UNK> upon their <UNK> journey of would be <UNK> and fame and like <UNK> <UNK> at the end they finish their journey not far from where they started but at least a little <UNK> and lot less naive this is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of but it's the kind of film you either love or hate a lot like company man in this regard i regard this movie like the 1000 islands of <UNK> new york it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself
<START> just utter trash i'm a huge fan of the <UNK> this being the sole reason i watched this movie but the only reason i can see for their presence was the <UNK> in complete and depth less quality their exact roles from <UNK> point <UNK> apart from that the <UNK> role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose and to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to <UNK> imitation is apparently the highest form of <UNK> but seeing as though this is nothing near <UNK> point <UNK> and in the same league as meet the watch if your a moron <UNK> in terms of political satire lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves
<START> although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman br br i'm so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it and even if they had they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters br br the story is revealed slowly and realistically the acting is superb the characters are <UNK> flawed and the dialogue is sensitive i tried many times to predict what was going to happen and i was always wrong so i was very intrigued by the story br br i highly recommend this movie and i must confess i'll forever look at my mom in a different light
<START> writer director bart <UNK> <UNK> his work here around a can of film that he says was <UNK> sent to him by <UNK> he says it shows the <UNK> <UNK> the television footage of their trip to the moon by <UNK> camera tricks the <UNK> were in low earth <UNK> all the time and <UNK> on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film br br unfortunately <UNK> research is so <UNK> that he doesn't realize his <UNK> footage is really taken in large part from the 30 minute live <UNK> also on that reel that was seen by millions not hidden away in <UNK> <UNK> as he implies and we have to wonder why <UNK> puts his own <UNK> narration over the <UNK> audio in the footage because hearing the <UNK> in their own words clearly spells out that the <UNK> were just testing the camera not <UNK> footage br br finally anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy <UNK> <UNK> up version of it he shows you more of the <UNK> film of <UNK> assassination than of his smoking gun <UNK> thinks he's the only one who's seen it what's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that <UNK> chose not to use such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being <UNK> by the window frames and so forth destroying his claim that <UNK> and <UNK> were placed in the <UNK> windows to create the illusion of a <UNK> earth br br as with most films of this type <UNK> relies on innuendo <UNK> <UNK> misleading commentary and <UNK> <UNK> to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence
<START> this is one powerful film the first time i saw it the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd used the english subtitles when i needed them and really got into this movie discovering just how good it is it is excellent br br the widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart an involving tale of good versus evil here it's liam neeson good vs tim roth evil both do their jobs well br br few actors come across as despicable as roth man you really want to <UNK> this guy in his arrogant irritating <UNK> he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this
<START> i saw the film at the <UNK> film festival it was beautifully done from cinematography to the acting it's the story of a father and son and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis beautifully written with dialog that never rings false the film showcases the acting talents of paul reiser and peter falk among others in this outstanding cast the film begins with the aging father peter falk is trying to figure out why his wife olympia dukakis has left him the father presents himself <UNK> on the <UNK> of his son and daughter in law the father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip they fish play pool watch a baseball game get drunk get involved in a <UNK> <UNK> and dance with strange women but more important they each confront the <UNK> tensions that can affect any family it's the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them
<START> my eyes in the name of god and all that is holy make me <UNK> this movie what drugs are you people on this could very well be the worst movie ever i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time i need to call a <UNK> to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster from start to finish glow <UNK> is an <UNK> masterpiece of satanic cinema when i thought to watch this movie with my jewish best friend and his family we thought oh hey this may be funny it will probably be bad but still a little funny how wrong we were we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be all of my friends <UNK> up for <UNK> as soon as the film was over and during the course of the movie one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to <UNK> his <UNK> with a wooden <UNK> i wish i had watched the video from the ring instead that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days for all who wish to see this movie you are not prepared you may think you are some sort of tough guy by renting this but this movie will break you push you to the ground and <UNK> on you
<START> it's hard to know what was going through per <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> heads when they wrote <UNK> from outer space the movie is billed as a comedy yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names capt b dick sgt <UNK> balls the rest of the movie is a presumably unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously <UNK> voice overs with the <UNK> basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling <UNK> computer displays filled with spelling mistakes and a plot that makes almost no sense br br even though <UNK> of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 this is the complete opposite of what a good film is it may be entertaining to watch with some friends but this film only deserves about a <UNK> out of ten slightly higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the writers somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie
<START> one two three four five six seven eight and back haha this is a must see first of all to see the work out there are a lot of work out shown see those close ups man you will enjoy it a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie it's a slasher but without suspense the ending is funny too and the clothes she's wearing in the wood confronting the <UNK> jesus looks like a clown the killings are mostly done off screen the blood flows but never too gory there are a lot of fight <UNK> too and hey no one got hurt and what about the weapon to kill never seen a big one like that won't spoil it you must see it and being a slasher there's a lot of t a too to guess who's the killer you will be trapped a few times and that's the best part but what about the story of the <UNK> in the woods huh but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have i'm glad that i have my copy one of those slasher failures but man those clothes and not to mention the <UNK> if you are in your 40's then this is one is back to memory lane
<START> this is one of the worst films i've ever seen i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel and i wish i hadn't i turned it off after a little less than an hour though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes i wish i had it <UNK> the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes which would be impossible i would in no way recommend this its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century i don't think as many people say that it is that the bell jar is necessarily <UNK> but this particular rendition could have been done without i'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice
<START> i saw <UNK> when it was first released and found it a major disappointment its script seemed forced and arch and too <UNK> '60s it's politics too <UNK> and ridiculous and let's face it i was still under a love spell known as <UNK> and i still haven't completely <UNK> it now the love is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and oh well good luck to me br br but time <UNK> on and time has been kind to <UNK> and time has been a teacher to me i <UNK> this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age and <UNK> is it's own experience and is only really linked to <UNK> through its creator the late great mr antonioni br br twelve years ago i had the great good fortune to see an absolutely <UNK> print projected at its correct size immense restored by an italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape to this day i remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appeared it was like a thousand <UNK> visual shock antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness and indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of place br br what is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own br br i remember the second time around seeing it the early 80s i had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards daria and mark in particular whereas before these two seemed like a smart <UNK> shadow version of <UNK> olivia and leonard read romeo and juliet they now were engaging me particularly the girl in her <UNK> <UNK> motion <UNK> she took her time to live everything everything dies around her br br upon exciting the theater the daylight of reality quickly began to <UNK> my new found enjoyment the <UNK> shoulder padded big haired 80s <UNK> but that's a hippie fantasy let it go br br the force of <UNK> vision had i had realised already worked itself inside of me the first time around so i answered 80s with an uh huh and <UNK> my love secretly <UNK> and <UNK> br br but this then is what good art does it lives inside of you and if you wish it has its way and loves you back secretly <UNK> and <UNK> and you get changed br br was thrilled to see that turner classic movies had decided to show <UNK> in its march <UNK> undoubtedly <UNK> must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment but hey sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all br br today reality hit <UNK> has been <UNK> mysteriously and replaced with the <UNK> antics of <UNK> restaurant br br so it is still too difficult too disturbing too what br br maybe it's that as with all good art it lives while everything dies around it br br peace
<START> julia stiles is a talented young actress who with <UNK> from a <UNK> agent has a lot of potential obviously the person who guided her into this travesty is not someone who cares anything about her career i sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in <UNK> to find another movie to sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal to anyone it was poorly written the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care
<START> its awful i cant believe that one of the greatest <UNK> in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of millions of people a movie which has no story again <UNK> khan has been appeared on the screen with nothing new the same as usual he is trying to make you cry by start <UNK> his head for thousands of times i think this is to much pretty <UNK> <UNK> to act the character of a <UNK> girl i didn't know that there is enough <UNK> in <UNK> for the <UNK> girls to do so many plastic <UNK> on their face and also there are enough make up <UNK> and also i didn't know that an indian can cross the <UNK> between both countries go to <UNK> and start dancing and singing may be <UNK> <UNK> were sleeping
<START> even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific it's hard to believe that anybody other than john cusack would have put money into this with a string of anti military anti war movies already being destroyed at the box office it's almost <UNK> that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script br br at first it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of <UNK> point blank with <UNK> and cusack s all over again but only about 90 seconds into the movie it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at dr <UNK> br br i liked so many of <UNK> movies that i thought i would risk seeing the dvd of this one i have to say that i don't know if cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can <UNK> for it cusack seems to be so <UNK> damaged by his hatred for george bush and the iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide tom cruise was never close to being this far gone not even close
<START> i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the 80's it puts me back at a simpler time no matter how corny they may seem today this movie is a good one i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever it has all the <UNK> characters that a young cowboy wants to be now as an adult i can look back and laugh and still feel sad but this time i actually know what's going on i did find one thing weird how many people can move to <UNK> and hook up with sissy get married move into a trailer have a falling out cheat have an uncle die then get back together all in the course of a month only in america
<START> i don't know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess that's what reviews are personal taste missed in this movie was the depth a very deep film many layers of emotion affecting <UNK> of <UNK> love because of <UNK> to societal beliefs <UNK> of the times and classes race relations not being in a very good state of <UNK> guilt yearning hate confusion very dark emotionally i thought under the skin you have to submit to the <UNK> of it a flowing movie not slow as stated before release yourself to the flow of the film the emotions will show themselves characters reveal their flaws their nasty <UNK> excellent and actually very cruel
<START> this movie is very great the acting is fine with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the <UNK> dentist who freaks out and <UNK> his patients in the beginning he sees his wife with the <UNK> and then he goes crazy he also takes revenge on his wife and the <UNK> beside the patients he <UNK> the most special effects are also beautiful although some are really fake like a <UNK> out tongue that has laid for 1 night outside and is still red in the morning but the torture scenes are absolutely well done though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow between the heavy parts are sometimes just <UNK> boring parts but for the real horror thriller fan this is a must watch
<START> carol the young girl at the center of the story is <UNK> to a foreign land spain at the height of the civil war conflict in the late 30s for this girl everything is new in it's <UNK> the war and her father are her constant <UNK> while she has to <UNK> herself in a <UNK> culture that is years behind what she has in new york br br <UNK> <UNK> directs this film by the numbers <UNK> family is obviously divided while <UNK> mother is married to someone that is an air force pilot with the <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the family's <UNK> are with the franco and the <UNK> that won the conflict br br the story adds nothing to what has already been told much better but it's an easy film to watch northern <UNK> magnificent landscape is shown don't expect a lot of action since most of what happens revolves around carol and the young boys she befriends br br clara <UNK> plays carol with sincerity and innocence maria <UNK> is <UNK> mother <UNK> the one that went away to america <UNK> maria <UNK> is <UNK> the teacher who befriends carol <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> the man that <UNK> left behind when she left for america this actor who usually has lead roles in most spanish films doesn't have anything to do as he remains an <UNK> throughout the movie
<START> half a dozen short stories of varying interest <UNK> us about life in <UNK> these stories are <UNK> and each contains a scene in which a <UNK> boom is heard this <UNK> that the events depicted happen at the same time br br the film begins with a <UNK> jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key the film <UNK> so stick with it two broken <UNK> in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a <UNK> ill patient begging for pain relief the last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving br br while the various scenes of family life take place in <UNK> the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live br br <UNK> of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90 minute drama
<START> a couple of days after writing about how garbage like mad <UNK> and this filthy earth receive money while <UNK> <UNK> and theo are totally ignored i had to sit through yet another british movie that had me scratching my head as to why it received a single penny some people may claim that because dead babies is based upon a highly regarded novel it has an in built market but both this filthy earth and mad <UNK> were also adapted from novels and they were an ordeal to sit through as well br br i had read the synopsis of the plot where a bunch of high class <UNK> go to a remote mansion where they're stalked by an internet cult but to be honest this isn't really how the story <UNK> and anyone expecting friday the 13th meets the shining is going to be <UNK> disappointed since 90 95 of the running time is taken up with said characters taking drugs and discussing sex and what hateful characters they are too not one of them is likable in any way and within minutes you'll be getting nostalgic for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> pot hoping that next time someone <UNK> on communist <UNK> they'll be successful in creating an <UNK> <UNK> anything that will <UNK> the end of such <UNK> <UNK> meaningless that the hateful characters in this movie <UNK> upon can only be welcomed br br not content with giving us a movie where the plot is meandering and where the audience fail to connect with the characters the director continues to spoil things further by getting all clever and arty no doubt that is to impress us so we will fall upon our knees and cry oh my god what a wonderful director the way he <UNK> us with his highly artistic technique and only a worthless <UNK> will fail to appreciate what a god given talent this man is i'm sure the vast majority of people either screamed how come my projects got turned down while crap like this didn't or wtf was the last half hour of this piece of crap all about you might defend the movie by saying the original source novel was <UNK> and this makes the film unwatchable i will agree that this movie is unwatchable br br i know the imdb classes this as an american movie but the style and faults with dead babies is uniquely british americans might think they've got things tough with bush but we've got tony blair not to mention dead babies mad <UNK> and this filthy earth no wonder everyone is ashamed to be british in the 21st century
<START> another very good mann flick thanks to the father son combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart brennan ben <UNK> is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne red river <UNK> bravo he's there to see that the younger man takes the ride <UNK> or bend you're wrong mr <UNK> jeff <UNK> stewart gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan john mcintire is excellent as the law of <UNK> with due respect for the <UNK> of justice over the reality of it another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people the loner can do neither and suffers for it br br the <UNK> above plays on <UNK> <UNK> that he can't live without his coffee this <UNK> addiction proves fatal probably the first and last time on the screen br br i recommend this film and now own the dvd
<START> i also saw this upon its release in <UNK> and have been struck since then with its final scene if this is an answer to <UNK> <UNK> ' then it's an apt and <UNK> response the notion that as this string is headed the town comes together is a much stronger message than the lonely personal <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> ' in this theme <UNK> is a phenomenal <UNK> of one my other all time favorites 'the magnificent seven ' both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances especially sinatra's transformation from bullying kid brother to <UNK> town <UNK> i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i've inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves
<START> this film caught me by surprise my friend told me that this movie was a chick flick boy was he wrong this movie has a great family appeal with no sex scenes like other movies jake <UNK> does an excellent job in homer <UNK> shoes the supporting cast is great as well br br science coming of age family <UNK> a great train scene this film has it all the soundtrack is good although the score is presented quite <UNK> the 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness br br the dvd is definitely worth its <UNK> in coal replay value is great i've seen it quite a few times already
<START> the first part che in cuba is about that portion of his life it contains too many <UNK> battles and che <UNK> to too many <UNK> wounded remember that che was a <UNK> it ends as castro wins the revolution che never gets to <UNK> the second part che in bolivia is about guess what it contains too many <UNK> battles and che <UNK> to too many <UNK> wounded br br when i realized this was supposed to be an epic i never knew anything but the title before it started i naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all david <UNK> lawrence of <UNK> more of that later br br not to be a racist but aside from what i've already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are well <UNK> unknown hispanic actors who look alike especially considering they all wear che <UNK> and all wear che <UNK> this results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than che <UNK> del toro even <UNK> has a very minor role while del <UNK> terrific think of lawrence with peter o'toole as the only discernible character no alec guinness no omar <UNK> no anthony quinn etc you get the idea br br because the other characters are <UNK> this results in a loss of reference when top <UNK> of che are killed you feel no <UNK> since you don't know who they are even when che is killed i don't think that's a spoiler there's no empathy from the audience he's just killed br br he's too one dimensional to relate to as a human being aside from being a revolutionary and second only to jesus in moral <UNK> the only thing we learn about che is that he's married with five children he tells another character that near the end what was his motivation a complete <UNK> br br maybe soderbergh is <UNK> <UNK> lean like <UNK> che lean never lets us know anything about lawrence the mystery man of <UNK> but at least lawrence had a friend <UNK> and associates guinness quinn he was as courageous as he was insecure i e had human qualities che is like a machine about as warm as the terminator br br earlier this year there was another war epic <UNK> che makes <UNK> look like it's a wonderful life
<START> i rarely write a negative review for this site but this time felt <UNK> to night <UNK> is without doubt one of the <UNK> films i have ever seen br br there was nothing happening in this film what so ever i didn't care for any of the characters didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot didn't care how it ended nothing br br there is no comedy no action no thrills no suspense nothing the highlights include no spoilers there's nothing to spoil a man climbing through a window a dog <UNK> outside a hotel room a car going over some rough ground and a truck <UNK> it's horn br br i really enjoyed one hour photo and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams but alas was sorely let down what's more disappointing is that i'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters but it just didn't work for me br br i might even have given it 1 10 but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers
<START> when i noticed that <UNK> <UNK> was being broadcast in the united states i was thrilled i then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing i adore m c <UNK> books about the wonderful scottish <UNK> the characters in the book are entertaining and very well written the powers that be who are responsible for this <UNK> mash apparently have never have read one of <UNK> books only the name <UNK> <UNK> has anything to do with the series besides the lack of familiar characters i find the whole show <UNK> loud it seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other if you love m c <UNK> adorable <UNK> <UNK> don't waste your time on this rubbish
<START> watching the <UNK> has been a interesting experience for me it is the first film i have ever seen where i have <UNK> at speed through parts of the non action and i can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to <UNK> <UNK> indie and find them fascinating br br the <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and over <UNK> one of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue apart from the set pieces where characters <UNK> in a very structured setting to make this work the film needed to feel more <UNK> which it didn't this leads to a lack of realistic character development everyone seems two dimensional br br the worse for this is the character of bill <UNK> aka <UNK> <UNK> i found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic at one point i even stopped the film because i got so annoyed by the character's aggressive violent and <UNK> delivery the lack of any other personality <UNK> apart from that of the <UNK> on switch which gets really predictable after a while and i so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities however one reason for this jar might be the <UNK> time <UNK> of the film supposedly 70s it feels and looks more early <UNK> if it had been more <UNK> fixed in the 70s his character might have seemed more understandable br br the lighting of the film was also awkward all the way through the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty jazz <UNK> atmosphere that just did not come off largely because the set was too well lit br br the <UNK> to me is an unbelievable film it doesn't depict real people or <UNK> any interesting ways of thinking about race identity or the life of a writer be they white or black br br strangely i came away with the feeling that this project needed david lynch his eerie <UNK> and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable
<START> <UNK> murder has been shown on most <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> since i used to watch it while ill from school a good 10 years ago i know i shouldn't really enjoy it in the same way i shouldn't enjoy <UNK> she <UNK> but i'm totally addicted to both and even have the dvd box sets ok i know that's sad br br dick van dyke carries the show as he stars as dr mark <UNK> a doctor at community general hospital in l a who is also a police <UNK> for the l a p d his son steve barry van dyke <UNK> real life son is a police officer who needs his father's help on very many suspicious deaths br br along for the ride is dr amanda <UNK> victoria <UNK> the resident <UNK> at community general and for the first couple of seasons you had scott <UNK> playing dr jack stewart who <UNK> and left the series in 1995 hoping to go on to bigger and better things he should have stayed where he was he hasn't done anything of note since and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in baby geniuses 2 <UNK> oh dear br br anyhow dr jack stewart was replaced by the younger dr jesse travis played by charlie <UNK> who stepped into <UNK> shoes pretty <UNK> br br the series is highly implausible but what <UNK> series isn't murder she wrote everywhere jessica goes someone ends up dead or the underrated father <UNK> mysteries about a murder solving priest with nun sidekick br br the series was much lighter up until 1997 this is because it had a supporting cast that included the bumbling hospital manager norman <UNK> played by michael <UNK> along with nurse <UNK> secretary <UNK> played by <UNK> hall after 1997 both these characters were no longer included and the series became a <UNK> affair with a bigger looking budget some episodes included far more action one episode the entire hospital is blown up br br this was a family show for the van <UNK> because as well as <UNK> son barry you also had <UNK> daughter and all his <UNK> making an appearance in various episodes br br as the series went on it got a bit silly one episode i remember dick van <UNK> plays his entire family which was a bit out of the ordinary but on the whole <UNK> <UNK> was a really good tv show which had numerous good guest stars br br since this show finished in 2001 dick barry have appeared together again in the <UNK> <UNK> series of tv movies made by the hallmark channel pretty much following the same path and still enjoyable dick who's now in his mid 80's doesn't seem to change a great deal and looks as if he'll be working till the bitter end br br tv show out of
<START> the year 1934 was when shirley temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself unfortunately the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here two of those things were singing and dancing another was a short interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds off the depression you know the other keys to <UNK> successful films br br this film achieved none of the above despite the star <UNK> of gary cooper and carole lombard and despite a very good director in henry <UNK> in addition there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring and too many arguments between a <UNK> lombard and cooper to top it off you didn't get the normal feel good ending which is what the public wants i guess they learned after this movie
<START> with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one won't go wrong but what can i say this was a horrible misfire the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it peter sellers and goldie hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it br br that song about <UNK> <UNK> is pretty cool but that is it i only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie this is almost the definition of one i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times in terms of it's definite <UNK> and all around <UNK> the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing not to mention the direction is just so out there br br peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss he will go from dr <UNK> and being there throughout his career to dumb movies like this and the magic christian which was very similar to this one in context and style but that movie did have a few funny moments this one is senseless and i am sad that someone as great as peter sellers was in this movie not recommended for anyone
<START> i am a huge willem dafoe fan and really sought out this film i had to get a region 5 chinese dvd of it but it is truly one of the worst that i've seen in quite a while br br the acting except for dafoe is horrible dafoe and <UNK> both wrote and directed this though he isn't credited as a director and they have no discernible talents for writing or directing stick to acting willem <UNK> get out of the business please br br absolutely nothing happens except a series of completely unconvincing totally without believable motivation acts by these two people that just met in this house <UNK> sleepy i couldn't care less expression practically never changes and the sex scenes are downright lame i actually <UNK> twice at one of them <UNK> they're definitely not the least bit erotic and yet are the only time the film isn't putting you to sleep then it's busy <UNK> you br br just awful
<START> this gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated it's pure delight and fun gratuitous <UNK> of blood insanity and black humor which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre a full exploitation of the almost universal fear of <UNK> and <UNK> shot only for the <UNK>
<START> i read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about <UNK> des <UNK> the love of the dead or something similar this of course <UNK> my curiosity so i ordered <UNK> 1 2 and der <UNK> the death king the <UNK> movies are ok even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject <UNK> even if they obviously are horror opera entries rather than intended to <UNK> fear in the viewers mind they are actually quite funny br br <UNK> on the other hand is in my opinion one of the best films ever made it consist of a series of scenes depicting the many <UNK> of death death as an enemy death as a <UNK> death as the very <UNK> <UNK> of the body the film is a metaphor over life it shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are it <UNK> its viewers to the <UNK> they we actually are the fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death and hence neither the process of dying is the core message of the film this is a most realistic film never does <UNK> try to hide death behind white <UNK> or whatever no matter what moral standards you set up death is <UNK> and will sooner or later be not a fiction but your reality this applies to you dear reader like it applies to the viewers of the film some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this which is fully <UNK> since they of course will live forever br br this is no exploitation movie why because death does not exploit us humans it <UNK> us we grow for seven days then we are brought back to the <UNK> state of pre birth that is death <UNK> gives us his version of the oldest of tales whether you choose to regard it as optimistic or <UNK> is up to you at first glance it may seem very dark consider though that in order for something to live something else must die who wants to live forever br br i believe that when <UNK> shows a body that are being consumed by <UNK> he shows not only <UNK> but generation of new life is it not better to die and give life to <UNK> and then birds and eventually become <UNK> than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre br br when you realize this you see der <UNK> it its right context br br <UNK> <UNK> hat die <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seven are the days of week weak mortal seven times the last hour br br dont fear the <UNK> <UNK> tells us because the <UNK> takes only what is <UNK> and <UNK> that are not <UNK> for food will <UNK> br br have a good life fellow <UNK> br br and watch this film that <UNK> only to <UNK> <UNK> the seventh seal in terms of depth and <UNK>
<START> a real classic ten out of ten every actor is perfect the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking wonder if this film is already out in dvd because it must be seen in widescreen version saw this film in the late fifties maybe three or four times and never since then forgot it i remember it was one of the first warner like cinemas cope features process called <UNK> which gave a very neat cinematography shelley winters and jack palance deserved an oscar for their performances the only thing i could criticize is not having been directed by someone like say nicholas ray to increase its rhythm and tension
<START> first off i'd like to say that the user comments alone left me with tears in my eyes from laughing one comment that bad sf movies become good comedies is right on the mark <UNK> made it's living off that br br if you look at the angry red planet as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959 you'll have the handle on this sucker all the elements are there the <UNK> occasionally logical more often hilariously <UNK> the adolescent boy attitude toward sex with the <UNK> captain good call on that one guys making eyes at the <UNK> scientist with hair so red it's a wonder it doesn't set off the fire <UNK> the ridiculous conception of mars as a planet so alien that everything <UNK> red yet one alien monster has a mouse face and the blob alien has an eye that <UNK> like a kid's toy the comic relief an overweight astronaut who sounds like he never finished the <UNK> grade in brooklyn and has a psychotic <UNK> on his ray gun and of course the mere fact that alien dangerously evil if these people had met e t they would have <UNK> him in two seconds flat <UNK> indeed br br don't get me wrong i rated this movie low still it's never boring except when the scientist tries to explain everything only to make it all sound more and more ridiculous and you have to admit in your little kid core it makes you jump a few times br br okay then don't admit it i guess you were never 10
<START> spoilers in as far as i describe characters and their relation to the plot br br this is a quality film the subject matter is at once grim and gripping the <UNK> determination of stephen <UNK> character <UNK> is simply captivating with any due apologies to him his <UNK> continually put upon expression serves the character well he is as we in england would say of the inspector <UNK> tv series character bound to be grim because he sees three murders a week well that's not strictly accurate as <UNK> <UNK> over a number of years br br you get a real sense of the <UNK> resistance of the <UNK> <UNK> brilliantly portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> who often seems made for this sort of role br br a key character and i write this as the remake of invasion of the body <UNK> is being shown on <UNK> is the donald sutherland character <UNK> <UNK> his quiet support of <UNK> is <UNK> and it <UNK> through <UNK> and drives the involvement of the fbi for <UNK> brilliant br br this is a must see as far as i am concerned
<START> for loyal <UNK> <UNK> fans who want to watch a good music video skip this one the producers decided to get creative and make this 80's video something of a sci fi story involving the evil <UNK> villain from which the band got its name br br what makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great 80's <UNK> <UNK> songs confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their <UNK> not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted but we have to suffer through some cheap spin off story <UNK> by an evil dr mario it's almost too much to bear 2 10
<START> in iran the <UNK> revolution has shaped all parts of life including everyday things but people still go on living their lives generally just doing the things you'd expect like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the world cup except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game br br a frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught <UNK> into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium the absurdity of the situation the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team nothing <UNK> there and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology br br amateurish acting good script and dialogue a really enjoyable film bend it like beckham sort of a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people
<START> hold your man finds jean harlow working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble the film starts out as his film but by the time it's over the emphasis definitely switches to her character br br the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner <UNK> owen and the mark yelling for the cops as he's being chased gable <UNK> into <UNK> apartment and being he's such a charming fellow she <UNK> him br br before long she's involved with him and unfortunately with his <UNK> gable harlow and owen try pulling a <UNK> game on a drunken paul <UNK> but then gable won't go through with it of course when <UNK> realizes it was a con he's still sore and gets <UNK> and gable has to punch him out but then he winds up dead outside <UNK> apartment and that <UNK> blond hair makes her easy to identify she goes up on an <UNK> to <UNK> br br the rest of the film is <UNK> and her <UNK> to prison life her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic <UNK> br br harlow also gets to do the title song and it's done as torch style <UNK> very popular back in those days she talk sings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well br br gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience a part he'd play often most notably in my favorite gable film <UNK> <UNK> br br still it's harlow who gets to shine in this film i think it's one of the best she did at mgm her fans should not miss it
<START> words fail me br br and that isn't common br br done properly this could have been great funny spoof b movie sci fi but sadly it was not to be rarely in the field of drama have so many competent actors <UNK> so <UNK> with such a dogs breakfast of a script i can only <UNK> the previous <UNK> comments go clean the bathroom in fact do anything except watch this film br br <UNK> lucy <UNK> nose <UNK> everything else br br most <UNK> line this isn't going anywhere br br if only every plastic surgeon could meet with such a fate
<START> i thought that this film was very well made heath <UNK> was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless orlando bloom and <UNK> <UNK> were also really good and believable how true it is to what really happened i have no idea but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30 000 signed a <UNK> for ned kelly not to be <UNK> so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat <UNK> why it didn't do better in the cinemas
<START> or released on dvd or screened on a cable channel like <UNK> life tv network i have been watching another favorite voyage to the bottom of the sea as well as lost in space and land of giants they've been showing them forever but aren't <UNK> to <UNK> for other shows my father and i were big fans as i was already a big science <UNK> nut still am and my father was an old school <UNK> of <UNK> they both attended <UNK> together i still have memories of several of the episodes even though i was only 9 more so than any show that old i think it was <UNK> on sat after bonanza some of the episodes i recall are the one where he takes the experimental drug that slows down action or the one where he body <UNK> the big ones i did that too or the one where there was a mine cave in and he conveys how to use mind control to have the trapped people slow their breathing by entering a <UNK> like state that is the one show that i wish i could see again i got my wish with the original outer limits and sci fi theater john
<START> as hard as it is for me to believe with all of the awful reality shows out there over the past few years this one has to take over the top spot for worst one yet i am still wondering if this was actually just a spoof done by the <UNK> gang if andy <UNK> were still alive i'd be sure he was behind this can a rock band <UNK> any lower than has <UNK> to do such a shameful thing as this the premise is simple and moronic audition a bunch of <UNK> rejects to become the new lead singer of <UNK> to take the place of michael <UNK> who committed suicide in 1997 eight years and no hits later the band commit the ultimate act of <UNK> by <UNK> themselves to <UNK> a bunch of talentless <UNK> to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime so they <UNK> all of these awful singers i thought american idol had its share of <UNK> who do atrocious <UNK> of just about every classic and predictable rock song imaginable and then they cut to the <UNK> band members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates you could see better and more original rock performers at just about any night club in any city in the world br br it has all the usual <UNK> elements of every other reality show lame reality participants lame interviews lame host <UNK> lame judging of performances and the lame <UNK> of one <UNK> at the end of each show can these shows get any more predictable it's clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band a last gasp of hope at <UNK> their lost stardom before they are finally buried into oblivion michael <UNK> if he had any shred of dignity when alive has to be rolling over in his grave not that <UNK> were ever a great band but i had no idea they were this pathetic if <UNK> are at all representative of what rock and roll has become this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all dead
<START> i love a good sappy love story and i'm a guy but when i rented love story i <UNK> for the end to come as quickly and <UNK> as possible and just the opposite for ali <UNK> character br br ali <UNK> as jenny <UNK> and irritated the heck out of me within the first 15 minutes when we learn that she has been <UNK> with a life threatening illness i couldn't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care if she didn't die her grating personality would probably have pushed oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce court br br people love this movie but it's one of the worst of the 70's
<START> william castle is notorious among horror fans as the b grade director of the 1950s and 60s his gimmicks his cost cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary it comes as no surprise then that someone jeffrey <UNK> who's made countless documentaries would finally take the time to <UNK> a documentary to his greatness such is spine <UNK> the william castle story br br i had a general understanding of who castle was having seen some of his films over the years i knew nothing about her personal life his goals and ambitions this film really fleshed out the man and gave me a fuller appreciation for the devotion he had for the craft of film making and his <UNK> to the horror genre the movie depicts castle as rival to alfred hitchcock with <UNK> being the artist who wins praise while castle is the carnival barker who <UNK> cult <UNK> but much less respect he is an icon to all second rate directors out there which is why it's not surprising that john waters is featured <UNK> in here joe <UNK> and stuart gordon also have <UNK> roles br br his gimmicks were what drove his fame and the documentary takes great pains to explain them which is crucial for those who are too young to remember the <UNK> 3 d of 13 ghosts see separate review the <UNK> in the seat for the <UNK> see separate review money back <UNK> for homicidal watching these films now outside the theater we can judge them for their content which personally i still enjoy but we cannot fully appreciate what audiences once felt br br the climax of the film is when castle goes from cult director to hollywood producer having bought the rights to rosemary's baby he is put in a very special place for <UNK> its film release hoping to direct he is <UNK> to producer in order to make way for new director roman polanski while at first disappointed this proves to be one of the best opportunities of his lifetime a hugely successful film and a job he excels at who better to control the purse of wild artist polanski than a penny <UNK> castle this was to be his <UNK> achievement though sadly the film is more often connected to polanski than castle br br the remainder of his years are played out and we are given personal <UNK> by his daughter and niece across the board everyone seems to have nothing but praise for the man somewhere along the way he surely upset one or two people but you would never know it from this film and i find that find this is a celebration of bill <UNK> life not e true hollywood story fans of the genre would do well to pick up a copy of this work br br i would personally recommend picking up the william castle collection which has not only this but eight of <UNK> films in it with plenty of special features even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how <UNK> was personally affected by castle and have <UNK> daughter terry giving a running reflection of her experiences with the different films and remakes it's almost a whole new film
<START> this is very much not the sort of movie for which john wayne is known he plays a <UNK> a man who gets things done through words and <UNK> rather than physical action the film moves with a quiet realism through its <UNK> <UNK> story br br for the open minded the patient and the thoughtful this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history br br there are two <UNK> stories the big story is of <UNK> <UNK> japan and <UNK> <UNK> america <UNK> when their interests conflict the small human story is of an <UNK> barbarian wayne and a <UNK> <UNK> initial <UNK> and dislike turning to mutual respect and love the human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations br br the movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well the two lead roles are performed to perfection john wayne is excellent as <UNK> harris striking exactly the right blend of force and <UNK> in his <UNK> with the japanese <UNK> <UNK> is likewise excellent as the geisha of the title charming and delightful the interaction between her character and john wayne's is particularly well portrayed this is exactly how these two individuals as they are depicted in the film would have <UNK> br br the script is very well written it lacks all <UNK> and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred the characters are real people not self <UNK> great figures from history furthermore the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety indeed the clash of a <UNK> and <UNK> powerful <UNK> japan and a rising newly powerful nation from across the ocean is <UNK> very well in one exchange between john wayne and the local japanese baron wayne complains that <UNK> sailors are <UNK> if they land in japan and that passing ships cannot even put into <UNK> for water the baron responds that japan just wants to be left alone wayne's character replies that japan is at an increasingly important <UNK> of international <UNK> and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of <UNK> <UNK> an important <UNK> a very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right and saw the other as being in the wrong the <UNK> clash between two self righteous peoples with <UNK> interests has its <UNK> throughout history a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future br br cinematography and the depiction of mid <UNK> century japan before the <UNK> growth towards <UNK> that was to follow later in the century is excellent a visual treat and an <UNK> insight into <UNK> ancient <UNK> br br i highly recommend anyone whether a john wayne fan or not to watch this film if you get the chance just be aware that it isn't an action film it is a representation of an interesting place and time in history and a slow <UNK> love story which much to their surprise comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters watch this film on its merits without <UNK> allow yourself to be immersed in its story and you will thoroughly enjoy it br br all in all an excellent film
<START> ya i rented it so shoot me br br a decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff but at least it's shot well director jon <UNK> takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside in most cases this should be a slam <UNK> but this little stinker <UNK> quite quickly the cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best but the story and writing is just plain awful slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film an eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it's <UNK> before any type of horror <UNK> and i found myself bored to death and making another <UNK> the cover art is appealing and i suppose it's worth a rental if you're looking for mindless low budget dreck but if you enjoy a good story and <UNK> ending reach for something else
<START> if you like plot turns this is your movie it is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will the characters are all gritty and engaging cage is at his best dennis hopper again shows his delightfully sinister side <UNK> walsh is perfect in his last performance laura boyle <UNK> dwight <UNK> makes a film debut superbly in a cameo i <UNK> this movie as i am having a really really really bad day film not a slow minute in this film a real sleeper this movie is underrated and sadly overlooked
<START> this is one of those movies that's difficult to review without giving away the plot suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on beyond the initial superficial tom cruise <UNK> around with multiple women plot br br the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm and all the cast are well suited to their parts cruise as the <UNK> smug playboy who has it all and then loses it all diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged <UNK> lover <UNK> as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the <UNK> psychologist the story involves elements of romance morality murder mystery suspense and sci fi and is generally an entertaining trip br br i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the <UNK> of various visual <UNK> is beautiful once you realize what's going on br br if you enjoy well acted movies with twists and suspense and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution then this is a must see br br 9 10
<START> i can see the guys doing the budget <UNK> for this flick well lets see now we spend 50 getting <UNK> <UNK> cause battle star <UNK> and the a team were cool the we spend 40 making a demon costume never mind that the demon is supposed to be <UNK> in the script and we spend the rest making the movie this was pretty bad and very cliche have a loved one present when watching or bring a good book
<START> i wanted to like this movie but it falls apart in the middle the whole premise is a good one and ties up nicely but the middle runs off <UNK> the people i watched with were getting annoyed while it ran off course and hoping it would end sooner than it did another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment i found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the <UNK> parts that had nothing to do with the plot i bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well but it lacks <UNK> writing and soul i think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride at face <UNK> while missing the plot people old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily edit out most of the middle section make it 50 minutes and it would be a solid flick i wish i had better things to say but i don't
<START> a few weeks ago i read the classic george <UNK> novel 1984 i was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books i've read recently so when i rented the dvd i was intrigued to see how this adaptation <UNK> up unfortunately the movie didn't even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that <UNK> so masterfully did in his book the director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book because he makes no attempt to demonstrate why the characters act and feel the way they do john hurt the main actor is <UNK> the entire way through and hardly does any acting until the end we never really find out what he does for a living or why his love affair is forbidden or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion this book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system <UNK> the characters and the fact that those are missing is the greatest <UNK> of this film besides that john hurt was a terrible casting choice looking about 15 years older than the <UNK> year old winston he was supposed to be portraying on a more positive note however the rest of the cast was well chosen it's just too bad they were put in such a horribly adapted film with the wrong lead actor brian o
<START> listening to the soundtrack at the moment the images come back with a <UNK> that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong in order to be able to type this i've seen it twice thus far and i should be ashamed for having seen it only twice br br i've seen all miyazaki studio <UNK> films and they are <UNK> nothing less than masterpieces except maybe for <UNK> which was even in the non cut up version too <UNK> compared to the <UNK> plus ultra manga still their strength sometimes becomes their weakness as they tend to get too naive positive <UNK> or with more nuance a bit too explicit <UNK> <UNK> at least compared to for example the other <UNK> master <UNK> grave of the <UNK> only yesterday <UNK> wars but not this one br br in laputa miyazaki <UNK> all the brilliant storytelling that <UNK> of tales have gathered and <UNK> over the ages combined with a bit of <UNK> but nicely <UNK> with not only a completely <UNK> atmosphere but also with the humor and amusement of for example <UNK> every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties the pacing is so perfect that i know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to <UNK> such a <UNK> pull on your whole being the story sets out as an action <UNK> with mysteries hinted at but when the girl falls from the sky unconscious floating with the stone and the main theme kicks in you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to <UNK> but the story then <UNK> and gradually over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and <UNK> beauty builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy hope beauty like following days of <UNK> <UNK> finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning knowing the path walked seeing the distance ahead but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it br br it is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind <UNK> you should see a <UNK> br br despite the fact that technically image wise some more recent <UNK> might be more overwhelming this to me remains his <UNK> masterpiece if you take a <UNK> of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986 you can only come to the conclusion that <UNK> miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years this of course has been suggested before but to me this is his only film that can on its own fully illustrate that simple fact if you miss this during your lifetime you'll die with a huge gap which would be a pity as the coffin costs the same
<START> saw it first in 1975 on some german tv channel and was hooked immediately afterwards i saw this movie around 12 times in cinemas and nowadays i have a <UNK> which i watch at least once a year this movie is excellent in every aspect direction acting cut musical score the sets are outstanding and very impressive the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film the dictator of <UNK> is pure <UNK> and raymond massey is just charming believable and <UNK> cast as the hero the positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by todays usually <UNK> standards especially the finishing scene which always brings a tear or two to my eyes even after watching the film so many times br br this movie is good on tv but it was made for the big screen so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema please do it's overwhelming
<START> <UNK> has much in common with the third man another noir like film set among the <UNK> of <UNK> europe like <UNK> there is much inventive camera work there is an innocent american who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand and whose <UNK> is all the more striking in contrast with the natives br br but i'd have to say that the third man has a more well crafted storyline <UNK> is a bit disjointed in this respect perhaps this is intentional it is presented as a dream nightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect br br this movie is <UNK> grim noir in more than one sense one never sees the sun shine grim but intriguing and frightening
<START> i enjoyed this movie and after watching it it made me wonder just how many <UNK> <UNK> exist in the world how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another because as this film demonstrates who's right is not foremost important its who is popular and feared which <UNK> the minds of <UNK> and influences them to allow this sort of <UNK> to happen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives a powerful performance as the rape victim and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend this is the kind of film that doesn't get the exposure it deserves remarkable and brilliant too good to be just a film made for tv
<START> some people have made a point of <UNK> this movie because they question the <UNK> of black people in the old west asian people in the old west or women with guns in the old west period get a grip and read a book there were quite a few <UNK> chinese there were quite a few blacks <UNK> and everybody outside of the <UNK> class had ready access to guns it is the second <UNK> you know and as far as the use of modern language goes none of those westerns people have <UNK> nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted americans had different accents used different <UNK> spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be <UNK> today don't blame historical <UNK> for the fact that you just didn't dig it be honest maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you're seeing
<START> in my opinion october sky is one of the best movies of 1999 it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need like wonderful story and good character interactions october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film
<START> i'm not saying that because the production values were so low but because it was filmed terribly that shot of the girl <UNK> her hair in the creek did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot it was terrible the lighting was just plain bad you could barely see anything and when the characters were talking you could barely hear what they were saying did i watch the whole movie of course not i <UNK> through most of it and i don't want to hear anyone say i need to watch the whole thing first to judge it this film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it's just plain terrible awful movie don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh but even then it's not because of the actors funny lines it's because of how <UNK> bad the production is
<START> i totally disagree with the other reviews all basically negative i took a chance on this movie and was glad that i did glad indeed i couldn't find anything wrong with it nothing period the script is original the actors are all likable and convincing dee smart reminded me of <UNK> brady from the brady bunch but this gal truly can act the setting in the australian <UNK> is perfect incredible scenery great soundtrack i e paul kelly god bless paul kelly the <UNK> are also here i have seen this movie twice in less than 24 <UNK> i will probably watch it again it is that interesting it makes one think it is was probably better than nine <UNK> of the so called hollywood blockbusters that were also out during this time back of beyond is a likable well photographed film i couldn't find anything wrong with it check it out my first review
<START> what was always missing with the matrix story was how things came to be in the real world say no more because this part of the story covered most of the <UNK> what was truly interesting was how political it was maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration <UNK> and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic <UNK> who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity what i also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was <UNK> by the idea of the unknown we as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often letting the lack of logic and thought <UNK> us because people can't believe the contrary well represented and put together this a true testament to how illogical humans can be
<START> most of the <UNK> i've heard concerning <UNK> machine has been pretty mixed a couple even saying that they think it sucked well to those people i say get some f <UNK> imagination and go f <UNK> yourself this was a very entertaining flick br br the story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its <UNK> into these <UNK> costume looking <UNK> called <UNK> eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also <UNK> a little <UNK> onto you which then is able to control your actions due to hot <UNK> your nervous system unfortunately for two love seeking lonely young adults they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug and before you know it <UNK> are taking place and blood is being <UNK> is there a way to stop the transformation maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat why do the <UNK> fight one another do the two desperate <UNK> get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty only one way to find out br br going into <UNK> machine i was kinda <UNK> due to the mixed reactions but it turned out being a great surprise a few unanswered questions some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points i can think of from the anime feel to it to the <UNK> becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses with a ever developing story that's interesting enough to keep <UNK> asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make up effects and blood splatter this is one flick fans of <UNK> horror <UNK> splatter fans should check out 8 outta 10
<START> abysmal with a capital a this has got to be one of if not the <UNK> show on tv right now i'm about as anti bush as it gets but this show doesn't even get a chuckle out of me what you think of bush as a president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you'll like this piece of crap show the jokes are not funny at all for example in a scene when <UNK> bush has his underwear on his head welcome to camp al <UNK> <UNK> there is nothing funny about that is it even supposed to be joke the commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show <UNK> it up were funnier than the show itself and that's just sad hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season it shouldn't even have had a first
<START> this 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians sandra locke <UNK> camp appearing at the home of wealthy <UNK> doctor george <UNK> seymour <UNK> in hope of help in <UNK> a <UNK> they can't seem to find but these two have other plans in mind when they find out <UNK> wife is out of town they end up taking control of the <UNK> <UNK> up the george killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening bizarre and disturbing movie but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about 30 minutes into it either way some even consider this a cult classic br br larry <UNK>
<START> this picture reminds me of a <UNK> more picture from 1957 called the admirable <UNK> whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved <UNK> back to servant madonna did ok in some movies however this one doesn't fire if there is any picture that show madonna can't act it is this one br br i am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of the admirable <UNK> but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail br br the plot is loose and the acting is mediocre the script should have been put thru the <UNK> before taking it on location while many here have <UNK> <UNK> for all her acting i think that in films like a league of their own was quite good and enjoyable and who's that girl showed a <UNK> of <UNK> style not shown before or afterwards other madonna films are not as enjoyable and i would have liked a to see a madonna animation series with the character from who's that girl i like the music from these two films however swept away remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so br br everyone has a bomb right
<START> a dreary and pointless bit of fluff bloody fluff but fluff badly scripted with inane and wooden dialogue you do not care if the characters indeed even if the actors themselves live or die little grace or charm little action little point to the whole thing perhaps some of the set and setting will interest those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived the <UNK> encounter is unnecessary and distracting and the <UNK> cassidy character himself is both boring and inept
<START> if you haven't seen this obscure little <UNK> you should seek it out it is the story of a bumbling wartime sad sack fred macmurray who is listed 4 f each time he attempts to join any branch of the military he finds a magic <UNK> which of course contains a genie gene <UNK> but the genie is even more bumbling than macmurray is sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants it is cute cheerful and pure fluff and you can't help but like it the plots is much like a disney film particularly since the two stars macmurray and <UNK> both made numerous disney films in the 50's and 60's although not together needless to say it all ends well for everyone and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good
<START> i watched mask in the 80's and it's currently showing on fox kids in the uk very late at night i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now <UNK> me to tears i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was it's just plain awful it is no where near in the same league as the transformers he man or <UNK> and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made i only watch it on fox kids because <UNK> <UNK> comes on straight after it that's if mask doesn't put me to sleep first one of the lesser 80's cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids
<START> allow yourself to be transported to a different old school kind of storytelling scoop is classic woody allen br br allen's latest <UNK> scarlett johansson who also appeared in last year's match point also by allen is surprisingly able to tone down her <UNK> sex <UNK> appeal and <UNK> into a normal looking student type with the aid of <UNK> glasses and outfits but still fails to make the audience believe how hugh <UNK> <UNK> character can be so smitten by her given the <UNK> background don't worry no spoilers here there are no grand <UNK> for <UNK> character here as she consistently plays the same character throughout despite the script saying otherwise you even forgive her character's apparent lack of logic continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer simply because he is his royal <UNK> jackman who is refreshing to see sans the <UNK> <UNK> br br if anything <UNK> is what the 70 year old allen is all about he continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always has as if he's never been exposed to modern film making which is probably what makes his quiet simple films appealing they never seem to aim for a specific market as if allen makes movies to his taste alone whether the public likes it or not
<START> many of the classic films of the late '60s haven't <UNK> their ability to <UNK> and confront the audience in cold blood hasn't lost an ounce of its power its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think some have complained not only about the film but about truman <UNK> source non fiction novel that the central message is <UNK> that may be true but this is definitely a case where the lack of ambiguity doesn't detract from the film at all its refreshing especially considering today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas to see a film with a convinced political voice <UNK> to force the audience to consider its viewpoint to be honest i'm not sure if i agree with the film's central message but i admire its <UNK> nonetheless br br even if you disagree with the anti capital punishment message there's plenty to admire about the film the acting from the two leads is terrific scott wilson still one of the most underrated actors ever is chilling as the <UNK> leader one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses robert blake is also chilling as the more <UNK> of the two and the one with a conscience his character obviously has a voice of reason but is terrified to go against wilson <UNK> a good amount of <UNK> subtext on his character's part the cinematography is terrific <UNK> yet gritty and really giving the impression the viewer is watching a documentary add another classic score from <UNK> jones and you have a masterpiece 9 10
<START> if you know the story of grey owl you'll love the movie annie <UNK> is a great actress and pierce is better than never in grey owl but in this movie there's no real scene of action i think this movie should be nominated at the oscars <UNK> go see this movie it's a classic
<START> it took 9 years to complete this film i would think that within those 9 years someone would have said hey this film is terrible i've seen better acting in porn movies the story is tired and played abused child turns into serial killer how about something new for a change how about abused child turns into a <UNK> at least that would have been a new twist why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea especially unoriginal movie ideas thinks that they can be a director i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed that shows <UNK> and spirit with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer director from <UNK> see hatred of a minute if you want a good movie from a <UNK> writer director stick with evil dead
<START> this movie is <UNK> one of my favourite movies in it's kind the interaction between respectable and morally <UNK> characters is an <UNK> to <UNK> and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen it treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that i can recall since the death of the <UNK> in the late seventies the sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the <UNK> into a masterful plot right and wrong without <UNK> eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser <UNK> of the genre in order to keep the audience awake no such scenes are present or needed the argument is <UNK> and honest to the <UNK> <UNK> is an important asset in a genre in <UNK> the the suspense is often achieved through the <UNK> of the audience no this is not miss <UNK> a note of <UNK> for the music is in order a film to watch and <UNK> every minute not just to see
<START> my wife and i both thought this film a watered down made for tv bbc version of manhattan murder mystery which is itself good but not great the story has little inter character tension or chemistry and not much of a plot woody allen's character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth and hugh jackman and scarlett <UNK> don't have a lot more to do it's pretty disappointing i must say ian <UNK> role is just an expanded cameo appearance br br the first thing that occurred to me was i wonder how much the bbc had to pay woody allen to <UNK> him from <UNK> he must've needed the money and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars i'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is <UNK> background noise if you ever want something to have on while you're <UNK> or <UNK> your <UNK> collection <UNK> do the job i wouldn't pay to rent it again
<START> many reviews i've read reveals that most people tend to like part one better than part two i feel exactly the opposite part one played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing che <UNK> personality through different types of film stock different locations and cutting back and forth between an interview and the cuban revolution for the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting in part two che enters bolivia and along with changing <UNK> location the rules and the structure changes gone are the <UNK> jumps and switching between <UNK> the documentary realism and the <UNK> instead now we are literally trapped with che in a <UNK> <UNK> landscape where the only people who exist are <UNK> too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option i <UNK> that it's the dark turn of che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer part one to part two br br the change in <UNK> location also <UNK> for me at least that che part one and che part two are in fact the second two acts of a three act structure begun by motorcycle <UNK> motorcycle <UNK> is che's coming of age or more appropriately coming of ideals in <UNK> che part one is his military <UNK> in cuba and che part two is his downfall in bolivia these movies do not completely illustrate his life we're missing his experiences in <UNK> and more importantly in my opinion his post cuban revolution <UNK> but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol he both <UNK> the <UNK> and need for armed resistance to <UNK> and revolutionary <UNK> in the post world war ii third world countries and their <UNK> by such activities as um the <UNK> <UNK> br br but yet again all of that is projected on screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches but through a much more intimate suffering portrayal of che at the end of his thread and his life again the rules have changed and in this case it's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all the number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the <UNK> shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape an existential hell where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second <UNK> to the desperation of hunted people starving to death it's just not that easy of a movie to watch but it's very effective br br <UNK>
<START> i can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the american audience to the <UNK> that is jet li fist of legend would have been a much better choice anyway black mask isn't terrible but it certainly isn't great either the final fight sequence is well staged by <UNK> woo <UNK> who went on to <UNK> the matrix but the english release suffers from rough editing and dubbing i'm begging the hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles jet li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and <UNK> <UNK> has a cool but brief role as the female <UNK> br br black mask has a strange <UNK> style that adds some interest but it is <UNK> with gun battles and explosions more focus on <UNK> fantastic physical skills were in order black mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up fist of legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows <UNK> skills
<START> i love this movie beautifully funny and utterly believable characters each scene <UNK> and more wonderful than the last every aspect of this movie is filled with wit and humour and love and depth a complex and engrossing story too this movie is filled with love humour and intelligence totally great
<START> looking at some of the negative <UNK> you really have to wonder what some people do for fun br br i was lucky enough to see the film during its all too brief theatrical run the audience laughed its heads off i'm watching a tape of it as i type and it's still <UNK> funny br br it's also got a sweet side with unexpected turns of genuine pathos the late great royal <UNK> is especially effective as the lonely down on his luck farmer <UNK> <UNK> richards and j j anderson are great as the lead kids and the actors in the martian suits although limited to <UNK> do a great job br br another thing to look for is the background details the film is full of <UNK> <UNK> and references to other sf and fantasy films take a look at the martian costumes next time one of them is wearing a marty <UNK> costume another is a <UNK> a third is in a house <UNK> uniform and a fourth is wearing a last <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i think it's a great movie because you get to see how <UNK> life at home is she got so much <UNK> and she wants to prove that girls can fight too i think she and adrian were great actors because of this movie i am boxing too it really impressed me the only negative part i think is the end because it's alright between diana and adrian but you don't get to see how it is at home and i didn't really like it that you also don't get to see how her father is doing and her brother but i think it was a great movie and i think i'm going to watch it a lot more i recommend it to anyone even when you don't like boxing you get to see a lot more than only boxing i had a great time watching it
<START> you can't exactly <UNK> her out of the way because she's old and if you were being <UNK> you might say that the <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> along with isn't really her fault nevertheless in these circumstances it's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake so it is with the <UNK> an attempt to do something <UNK> with a romantic comedy that in this way is <UNK> <UNK> because the <UNK> is all wrong sort of like showing off your <UNK> skills at a <UNK> funeral br br to further <UNK> the metaphor perhaps <UNK> like the old lady one starts to feel with the set up of the film that its demise cannot be far away sure enough this particular <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> slowly <UNK> away at our <UNK> of empathy in tiny little <UNK> as <UNK> we come to the <UNK> that the proceedings are only headed in one direction downhill its <UNK> attempts at <UNK> can be seen coming a mile off again not unlike the grim <UNK> of death br br returning once again to the image of <UNK> <UNK> the main character tom is shown to <UNK> repeat this action throughout his life if there are indeed degrees of <UNK> then this <UNK> is possibly a good few <UNK> ahead of <UNK> other more famous role to find <UNK> in the awkward position of having to <UNK> audience <UNK> with a character even more <UNK> than ross is certainly a tough ask even for as <UNK> a comic performer as <UNK> but i guess he can find fault with himself for <UNK> on to some seriously <UNK> situations in the first place br br how will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he's picking scripts where the characters could almost be <UNK> even if the situations aren't a man with a <UNK> high school crush on someone he hasn't seen for years sound familiar paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her <UNK> role but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable differences present weren't so <UNK> as well unfortunately the romantic element is so well worn it's <UNK> and the <UNK> is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the <UNK> film is as something of a <UNK> 2 10
<START> i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this horror movie i did not get scared even once while watching it it also is not very suspenseful either i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie so what's left br br the ring is a <UNK> scary movie i wish other movies would stop <UNK> from it e g the trade mark long hair please give me some originality br br will not recommend this movie
<START> it's funny how your life can change in a second to attend <UNK> <UNK> for the first time it was an unforgettable experience the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on br br eric <UNK> performances and mainly of helen hunt oh man helen is the <UNK> and <UNK> woman in earth are wonderful wesley snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles a film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is <UNK> enjoy each moment of your life br br really to a film as that the any hour is not attended sorry it's a brazilian expression
<START> i think this movie is absolutely beautiful and i'm not referring only to the breathtaking scenery it's about two unhappy english <UNK> who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace they're longing for and interestingly that peace comes from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> more so than without i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding the acting is a joy to watch in itself i especially love the characters of <UNK> <UNK> lawrence and lady caroline polly walker
<START> never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just dire i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made <UNK> pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choice maybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a film i found it unbelievable lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes <UNK> stilted a musical <UNK> he may be but a serious actor <UNK> ain't the acting by dylan mcdermott and rose <UNK> was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it didn't fit into any genre it didn't <UNK> any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense in fact i found myself praying for the end and <UNK> a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters
<START> growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the <UNK> and 30's i grew up very close to most of the italian families living there this move brought back so many pleasant memories this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies
<START> minor spoilers br br i am like many others a huge jerry bruckheimer fan so when i saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front and the trailer coming by before <UNK> 2 expectations were rising a jerry bruckheimer production big cars <UNK> cage and fresh from an oscar angelina jolie what can possibly go wrong a lot br br the script is neither funny which it tries really hard to be nor exciting you put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and <UNK> <UNK> you've got comedy i don't think so excitement is totally out of the picture first of all and this is probably said many times there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed if you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill <UNK> brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days next thing you know is that <UNK> the brother is walking with <UNK> in the streets again is this excitement think not then comes the best bit the romance between <UNK> and angelina she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to <UNK> <UNK> you have a girlfriend ' <UNK> you seeing anybody ' <UNK> went wrong ' etc br br then there's only one <UNK> of hope left the car chases they're disappointing to say the least because the trailer made it look like it was full of them and there's only one a very long one caught in <UNK> <UNK> camera movement i really had trouble following the action br br so is it an action movie a thriller a romantic comedy there's no need to decide just avoid this horrible mess i'll give 3 out of 10 stars and i feel like i'm being generous
<START> omar <UNK> is an outstanding actor i really think he gets into his character alot when <UNK> gets shot he shows true emotion he also shows true emotion when <UNK> puts the gun to him in the room omar is a very talented actor
<START> i had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie it was an epic of <UNK> a dream of <UNK> gone a great potential indie film or big budget drama it somehow got into the hands of a hack who clearly took notes watching boogie nights and <UNK> without actually learning anything at all the script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags i feel sorry for the actors since the characters in the book were rich and <UNK> but cut down to embarrassing <UNK> in the film mason <UNK> is great when given the opportunity as is dylan baker but the <UNK> that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special poor people good rich people bad br br though it's almost worth watching to see the southern california beach where gary <UNK> parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in <UNK> br br it's a good book but an embarrassing turn for first time director mills <UNK> br br k
<START> a lot of the problem many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining ignoring it is based on a true story or <UNK> against a film that <UNK> che which it really doesn't this film is very close to jon <UNK> definitive bio on che and gets the story right <UNK> does an excellent job of setting the mood for the <UNK> <UNK> that was che's <UNK> adventure you really get the impression of the total <UNK> and <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> to che's revolutionary ideas or of the difficulties that his men faced with <UNK> and the <UNK> sorry to bore the attention challenged movie fan out there but that was how it happened so don't go into this movie expecting a rambo shoot em up its a true story
<START> i always thought people were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy films a couple of them weren't bad modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so <UNK> two shoes movies like these rarely get praise br br nonetheless i can't defend this movie either you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get this is <UNK> than corny if you know what i mean it is so corny i cannot <UNK> too many people actually sitting through the entire hour and a half br br the story basically is andy mickey rooney trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some <UNK> from new york city as if that was the ultimate people were a lot more social conscious in the old days you'd hear the term social <UNK> as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life it's all utter nonsense of course and looks even more so today br br however it's about as innocent and clean a story and series there were a half dozen of these andy hardy films made as you could find also if you like to hear judy garland sing then this is your ticket as she sings a couple of songs in here and she <UNK> her way into <UNK> heart oh man i almost throw up even writing about this
<START> elisha <UNK> plays sue a <UNK> year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late 18th century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face poverty br br i was <UNK> through the channels and found this i read the synopsis and suddenly saw elisha <UNK> i thought okay and watched the movie i didn't realise elisha had done films before 'the girl next door and <UNK> elisha provides a satisfactory performance the plot is a little cheesy but the film works its amazing how this young girl went on to become the <UNK> babe in hollywood
<START> before i start let me say that i fully believe in god i believe in heaven and in hell kay now that thats out of the way i just wanna say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves <UNK> think they are doing the last time i checked a host doesn't <UNK> <UNK> hatred filled <UNK> on tv or try to <UNK> their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that <UNK> onto the channel all of these that crazy idiotic <UNK> bible <UNK> fred <UNK> lover pat robertson does daily i am all for free speech but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell this is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of <UNK> many problems one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some tv since the teach didn't give us any work and we against many of <UNK> will watched <UNK> club and of course that jerk pat was on <UNK> and raving about the bible and he said simon along the lines of god says homosexuality is a sin and i actually heard a kid go hmm i guess he's right wtf seriously if the host is trying to make people think that someone else's sexual <UNK> is a huge sin then they seriously need to take that host <UNK> tape them and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the <UNK>
<START> the secret of kells is an independent animated feature that gives us one of the <UNK> stories surrounding the book of kells an <UNK> <UNK> from the middle ages featuring the four <UNK> of the new testament i didn't know that this book actually exists but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be who wrote it and how it has survived over 1 000 years this is one of them br br we are introduced to brendan an orphan who lives at the <UNK> of kells in ireland with his uncle <UNK> <UNK> voiced by brendan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> a massive wall around the <UNK> to protect the villagers and monks brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks they are more focused on reading and writing something <UNK> <UNK> does not have time for anymore he fears the <UNK> those who <UNK> and leave towns and <UNK> empty and burnt to the ground br br one day a <UNK> comes from the island of <UNK> near scotland it is brother <UNK> a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him <UNK> to stay and brendan buddies up with him <UNK> has special plans for brendan first he needs <UNK> for the book but he requires specific <UNK> the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest an area off limits to brendan seeing that he is the only chance for <UNK> to continue his work he decides to sneak out and return with the <UNK> before his uncle notices his absence br br in the forest brendan meets ashley the <UNK> of the forest she allows brendan passage to the <UNK> and along the way becomes akin to his company she warns him of the <UNK> danger in the dark and not to foil with it there are things worse than <UNK> out there from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the <UNK> <UNK> of invasion br br i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains the animation makes perfect sense i'm sure you have seen pictures or copies of old <UNK> from hundreds of years ago with <UNK> borders colorful pictures and <UNK> <UNK> creatures and <UNK> <UNK> the pages much like the opening frames of disney's the sword in the stone the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and <UNK> it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to <UNK> each other br br i couldn't take my eyes off of the incredible detail this is some of the finest <UNK> animation i have seen in years it's vibrant stimulating and full of life the characters are constantly surrounded by designs <UNK> and <UNK> in trees on the walls and in the air just floating around it enhances the film br br the story is satisfactory although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more with a runtime of only 75 minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act it doesn't give a lot of information nor does it <UNK> to the significance of the book we are reminded of it's importance but never fully understand we are told that it gives hope but never why or how that was really the only lacking portion of the film otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely <UNK> by the animation br br i guess that's okay to a certain degree the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short the story lacks a few parts but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed
<START> let me tell you something about this movie i have seen it twice the first time i was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me i really liked it i thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool br br i saw it again a few days ago it was horrible really i don't know why i thought it was funny before but now i didn't laugh at all there was nothing even slightly entertaining it was just dumb the story was weak the acting was nothing special there are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best br br what is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist really don't get me wrong usually i don't complain about racism in movies however i have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like 'the shaolin <UNK> or about the fact that the only black man in 'the street <UNK> is one of the bad guys or whatever you get the point there are people seeing racism everywhere i wonder how would they react to a movie like 'the meteor man' why i will tell you why there are no <UNK> in this movie there are no white people among the good guys in fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys all the good guys are african americans don't get me wrong i don't care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green what i do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie this is the only movie like that that i have ever seen it is just not realistic if there is only one black man in a japanese movie which is the case with 'the street <UNK> there is no problem in japan most of the people are <UNK> but if there is only one white man in an american movie there is some sort of problem in usa most of the people are white it is like filming a japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one asian as a bad guy just not real br br that is it i am giving the movie the rate of 4 10 it would be 1 10 if i hadn't have fun with it as a kid
<START> saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars only wish i could find it again would certainly buy view it if i could please somebody bring it back fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a <UNK> during world war ii and his leading ladies joan leslie and especially june <UNK> were beautiful and charming it was a musical but also romantic funny and clever this was my favorite movie starring june <UNK> although i always liked her her dazzling smile lit up the screen and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film the supporting cast <UNK> credit to their individual roles a well balanced and light hearted film only wish we had more like it
<START> normally i wouldn't feel <UNK> to review something i only saw a half hour of but i'll make an exception for this one br br let the dialogue speak for itself here's some of the bad guy's lines i smell teacher sorry teacher you get an <UNK> ' br br bad guy and bad girl right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs they're getting hot and heavy br br him so how do you feel about shooting some innocent <UNK> br br her <UNK> you sure know how to show a girl a good time one generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone gets to sum up his life and personality in this line i am a chicken <UNK> this was the usa network version my old man was right no wonder he left us boo <UNK> br br not actually a spoiler bad guy on fire screams <UNK> fire
<START> did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul <UNK> rachel <UNK> and miranda richardson couldn't pull this one out about two thirds it looked like <UNK> eyes were saying i can't believe i signed the contract it's not the worst movie i ever saw but it's on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesn't move with <UNK> con man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into
<START> this movie is proof that film <UNK> is an enduring style and extremely worthy of stay alive for me it is he best example of film <UNK> since <UNK> br br it will unfortunately never get the recognition it deserves it was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its <UNK> of fans through <UNK> like <UNK> cinema and word of mouth rental <UNK> br br i highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and <UNK> into its highly convoluted plot
<START> this might be the worst film ever made and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study <UNK> the soundtrack is <UNK> featuring barbara <UNK> out some of the weakest <UNK> ever put to film and don't even get me started on the plot you will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is <UNK> terrible the rampant ego of streisand thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to oscar heights led to this disaster i'm pretty sure the novelist <UNK> <UNK> singer hated this film and never <UNK> streisand i can't blame him this movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of 'the sound of <UNK> being played backwards on an old <UNK> it's truly that bad i'm amazed that anyone from streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended
<START> 1 aliens resemble <UNK> toys and hand puppets while having arms that don't function br br 2 aliens <UNK> <UNK> space travel but they don't know how to push an <UNK> vault door open yet can push open a door being held shut by five people br br 3 old security guards know how to get a hold of <UNK> and are just waiting for the right time to use it say when they are suddenly fired for no <UNK> reason br br 4 apparently us army boot camp in the 80's involved several sessions of garden tool combat including the <UNK> spin of death br br 5 to impress your <UNK> girl friend you have to save the world <UNK> neighborhood from aliens br br 6 all women are <UNK> either openly or secretly br br 7 <UNK> night <UNK> look like bad <UNK> br br 8 <UNK> <UNK> double as dancers for the <UNK> how did they get talked into this who can only do bad 60's dance moves br br 9 army <UNK> secretly dream of being rambo br br 10 <UNK> apparently have a setting for flash bang br br 11 being burned alive apparently only leaves one with minor burns on their arms br br 12 us army staff <UNK> apparently happen to always be in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area br br 13 aliens apparently always go home which means back to the vault they were un locked in br br 14 aliens are attracted to bright lights which apparently means in the los angeles area one would assume the <UNK> house is the most <UNK> lit thing in the area br br 15 showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the audience <UNK> for more br br 16 <UNK> from the 80's apparently have horrible suspension systems br br 17 comedy is supposed to happen in this film br br 18 horror is supposed to happen in this film br br 19 spoofs and <UNK> are supposed to happen in this film br br 20 this film <UNK> insomnia br br 21 apparently garden tools make electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used not just in fights tell me i'm not the only one who noticed this br br the simply truth is this film just came out wrong period there isn't much meat on the bone nor does it do anything really well even average it's just bad however i've seen far worse and the <UNK> fight scene is pure comedy gold intentional or otherwise br br 2 10 jaws 4 was worse then this at least the film never took itself seriously
<START> written on the wind is an irresistible wonderfully kinky film as only director sirk could have done it the movie is <UNK> in a bucket full of <UNK> symbols weird <UNK> and colorful <UNK> the connection between financial success and moral <UNK> is the film's main theme sirk seems to suggest that sexual <UNK> is one of the side effects of capitalism however i prefer to see the movie as a prime example of what sirk could do with <UNK> material the palette of colors is particularly impressive the acting in the film is great too rock hudson and lauren bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of <UNK> but the movie belongs to robert stack and dorothy malone she deservedly won the best supporting actress oscar who manage to keep the film at a <UNK> point kudos to frank <UNK> <UNK> score russell <UNK> brilliant camera work every single shot is a masterpiece in itself and the production design department also the title tune is a beauty it's an unforgettable movie
<START> linda <UNK> was the victim of a sadistic woman <UNK> chuck <UNK> i don't understand how having sex with a dog which is animal abuse as well can be found to be entertaining or funny linda <UNK> was a virtual prisoner who was <UNK> into making these films i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings we call ourselves <UNK> however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being <UNK>
<START> it's interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films while the <UNK> was a good if not entirely accurate adaptation washington square is a heavy handed and poorly acted except for the part of dr <UNK> film that could have been so much better br br the director's attempts at making <UNK> scenes were so obvious that i actually <UNK> it has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have such as <UNK> i agree with other comments about <UNK> portrayal of catherine as an idiot instead of naive and shy she made me despise her not feel for her br br <UNK> transition from <UNK> <UNK> to adult cynicism the whole point of the story was <UNK> just as it was in the novel but we don't have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film i think someone <UNK> adaptation class at <UNK> br br i appreciate the director's attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just didn't work
<START> users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with have they all been <UNK> i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be <UNK> to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie br br from the first <UNK> is just a chase film we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another and another and another and another do you see a pattern <UNK> there is virtually no time <UNK> on plot character development or boring old reality br br if you haven't see the other two bourne films you're pretty lost if you have you only wish you were lost somewhere a long way from a cinema br br paul <UNK> <UNK> style worked exceptionally well on united <UNK> which was a sentiment <UNK> desperate to happen but on bourne and his interminable <UNK> it just has the effect of <UNK> the audience from involvement with the character he runs he jumps he punches he gets blown up he <UNK> tall buildings <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> above all he survives he survives like a plastic action man survives which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension so he drives off a building so what he'll survive yawn br br there's a girl thrown into the mix because <UNK> love interest died in a previous incarnation but she's just <UNK> i've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarlet br br <UNK> own journey of literal self discovery is dull and <UNK> and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie he was turned into a killing machine big deal he finds out his true identity so what it doesn't have any emotional <UNK> when it comes br br the <UNK> ending is <UNK> and weak oh dear the more i think about this film the more i hate it i've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment i'd better end now before the slide continues br br i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller the bourne ultimatum is neither it's a loud tedious series of flashy edits ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence br br the idea that it <UNK> the <UNK> to the bond franchise is utter crap casino <UNK> blows it out of the water
<START> i think if you were to ask most <UNK> whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith you will find they do not i know i do not what you will find instead is that they believe the promises christ made of a <UNK> so even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity <UNK> can and will correct this br br it really gets down to a simple question is god real to you or is this all just make believe if he is real and you trust him you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be br br i had a heart attack about a year and a half ago one in my family was horrified when she saw the words no blood written in large letters over my <UNK> i <UNK> with her that if i were in a position that only a blood <UNK> would save my life would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came she didn't get it god just isn't real enough to her too bad i wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives
<START> let me put it another way balls or how about <UNK> <UNK> this is truly awful more embarrassing than those it attempts to <UNK> julia roberts is a skilled actress and usually her work is of the highest standard this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look <UNK> normally she is the <UNK> professional yet i swear that in her eyes there were signs of <UNK> and despair br br the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director chris walken turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors unfortunately that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential too little too late br br zeta jones was wooden cusack was cusack and crystal should stick to acting the two talented ex buffy stars had different experiences green hopelessly <UNK> cast and <UNK> under used well done to julia for just about <UNK> this from being the worst movie ever made
<START> this movie is one of my very favorites it's hard to explain why maybe it's the innocence of <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> paired with the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack also some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves finally the story is one that always <UNK> at my <UNK> and the last scene is so bittersweet all in all i love this movie it's perfect for a <UNK> sentimental girls' night
<START> in the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area or whatever the title for that oscar is holes has credibility i think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material if the author can't write a screenplay to save their life then have the author and someone <UNK> talented in the area of <UNK> create it aside from that this review is about holes br br the reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within 1 louis <UNK> is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay i watched the movie and then read the book and both didn't <UNK> <UNK> or stupidity some people just have natural talents that can <UNK> <UNK> 2 the best performance award goes to <UNK> <UNK> for his portrayal as the main character he <UNK> himself into the role i wanted to see his character <UNK> before the conclusion 3 to <UNK> up the suspense a bit andrew davis was brought in this is the man that made harrison ford run hard and run fast he also can make steven seagal smash some heads as for this film he made <UNK> and the rest of the boys dig some holes in other words he can make an action packed movie and make it well even if action isn't the main genre isn't action 4 my second favorite performance goes to jon voight as mr sir sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer when voight <UNK> the line once upon a time i must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny he is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent 5 tim blake nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script this is probably the second best role i have seen him in second only to <UNK> brother where art <UNK> ' 6 i love the choice of settings for the movie i didn't know california was that dry or that <UNK> i guess population and land area figures both can be misleading 7 the overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water one could only imagine digging a hole in that <UNK> area for half a day 8 the rest of the cast should deserve a box of kudos bars as well <UNK> weaver henry <UNK> <UNK> thomas jake m smith and the rest of the bill were <UNK> because of their talents and it <UNK> very well great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble 9 i like a movie that doesn't explain anything right away when stanley got <UNK> in the head with those baseball <UNK> it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key <UNK> in making a good movie 10 disney pictures not <UNK> disney needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films it was <UNK> for me and i am a college student the last mature juvenile disney film i saw was something wicked this way comes and holes possibly <UNK> it like the election in 2000 it's still to close to call disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over <UNK> a cash cow when they see it ten reasons give a score of ten br br all in all holes is one of my favorite disney films and probably one of the best this year granted this movie may not be oscar material but whoever said oscar material is the best material in terms of being a movie from a book i have read this ranks behind fight club on my list which is on top for being a film i saw in 2003 this is in the top five somewhere behind <UNK> river compared against harry potter stanley <UNK> easily takes a <UNK> to harry's head and brings the final death blow with a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> nose everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains here ends my rant
<START> i suppose it was for temple <UNK> who written basically a remake even though there are few changes which just make it worse spoilers it is much similar to the original melody <UNK> new daughter is threatened by <UNK> sister morgana morgana escapes but keeps her promise to take melody away from them did ursula have a sister and she is not that great a villain as ursula was this is where there is similarity <UNK> is kept from the sea until morgana is captured but she doesn't know a thing about it because it all happened when she was a baby a wall <UNK> the palace to keep her in and morgana out she goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with sebastian who is not as funny or fun as in the original she finds a <UNK> with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds morgana here is a similarity morgana tricks melody making her happy by turning here into a mermaid meanwhile eric melody and king <UNK> look for her to stay a mermaid she needs to steal the <UNK> from <UNK> so melody does because she does not know king <UNK> is her father she makes friends with a penguin and a <UNK> and here is where it is awful the <UNK> who live with them in an icy ocean hate them because they are <UNK> so they try to prove they are heroes and fail that does not suit the little mermaid and the dialogue during those conversations between the <UNK> and those two characters is ear bleeding you know why because the first had a great story this one is not and is not magical it is just an example of how bad many sequels are br br melody finds them and they help to take her to <UNK> to prove themselves when they take the <UNK> ariel finds melody with morgana melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the <UNK> to morgana then she shows her true colours once she grabs it poor ariel and melody are in her custody the penguin and the <UNK> begin to prove themselves when they fight <UNK> shark friend sorry i did not mention him earlier they finally prove themselves eric king <UNK> and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before morgana by the power of the <UNK> melody takes it throws it to <UNK> and he <UNK> morgana literally then ariel <UNK> to melody and thinks it is all her fault it was not ariel did the right thing to protect melody but they never say so <UNK> offers melody to live in sea or land she in fact has a better idea she uses the <UNK> to <UNK> the wall so humans and <UNK> folk can be together then everyone sings an awful song the end br br whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original i do not dislike this because i am a teenager i liked it when i was very very little then as i grew older i began to see what is bad about this film young young kids will enjoy it but it is likely that when they are in primary school they will forget about it normally i would think i over judged a film and it was better than i remember when i watched it again but not this one it is even worse story is no exception if you thought by reading this that the story is good read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points well you know the story now i am sorry for spoiling it for you but i had to point out some bad parts of it one of the worst things is the animation colour is awful the original had beautiful colour watching this almost made me want to go blind even the <UNK> and landscape design were not good the original had beautiful magical <UNK> and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well making it a joy to watch br br the music is unbearable compared to the first the music here is crap songs are not that well composed and tara strong i think that is her name who did melody can not sing she at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song so much for having melody as a name and the music is not at all beautiful or moving little mermaid 1 won an oscar for it and it truly deserved it this one deserved a <UNK> award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist br br i did not like the voices several people who played characters from the first did the same ones in this <UNK> benson is a great singer but now that she is older no <UNK> to her her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore and i am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this if i was chosen for this film just by reading the script i can tell it would be a bad film the characters are different now ariel is more <UNK> now but annoying they <UNK> her character making her too mature in sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason she was sixteen in the first there is little chance she changes that is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life screenwriters should think of that they should think of the character br br well i suppose that is it for me i hope you find my comment useful because i am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view
<START> i must admit i am a big fan of south park and was expecting basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be i think this is what happens when you mix david <UNK> matt stone and <UNK> parker together this movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously the slap stick style humor mixed with stone and parker just works <UNK> the kind of humor present in basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be a hit don't bother trying to be critical just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor
<START> although i don't usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this i happened to catch the 1994 version of angels in the <UNK> <UNK> on cable one saturday morning just as it was starting being an <UNK> <UNK> fan i was curious to see what <UNK> was like as a youth of 21 20 when he filmed it i suppose in this early role as danny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the california angels in the 1951 original the hard luck baseball team was the <UNK> pirates the name change is a nice touch since it turns the title into <UNK> i decided to give the flick a chance and it turned out to be a pretty <UNK> even <UNK> experience with a decent balance of laughs tears <UNK> and baseball based excitement also my 7 year old daughter liked the angel effects directed by mike <UNK> frequent <UNK> william dear <UNK> is the story of roger joseph gordon <UNK> a foster child who <UNK> real hard after his <UNK> do well dad the convincingly sleazy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> says they'll be a family again once the last place california angels win the <UNK> soon roger starts seeing real angels at the <UNK> games led by christopher lloyd whose usual zany eccentric <UNK> keeps <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> zone <UNK> manager george knox danny glover in world weary <UNK> mode is a hard sell but once the team starts winning he believes <UNK> angel <UNK> and soon knox has roger and his cute <UNK> pal and fellow foster kid j p the adorable <UNK> davis jr at every angels game for good luck knox even starts <UNK> down his own <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> language as much to <UNK> the angels as for the kids' sake resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an <UNK> in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along predictable obstacles ensue such as obnoxious <UNK> ranch wilder jay o sanders trying to make trouble for knox because of the angel angle sure it all works out fine for our heroes in the end but they're so darn <UNK> you don't mind baby faced <UNK> has a couple of good lines i especially like his exchange with glover about the emotional impact of the national <UNK> at a <UNK> as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel <UNK> his shoulders before he goes up to bat <UNK> isn't the only future star in <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> include matthew <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and of course young gordon <UNK> went on to co star in tv's 3rd rock from the sun as well as such films as 10 things i hate about you the always amusing taylor <UNK> and oscar winners but not for this film brenda <UNK> and ben johnson lend able support if you're a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars <UNK> <UNK> will do nicely
<START> this movie deserves more than a 1 but i'm giving it a one because so many <UNK> fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list seriously it's not that great its not that bad its a stupid cult classic with so many <UNK> fan boys it's ridiculous these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say i'm rick james b <UNK> no matter how old or annoying it gets i dread having to hear i'm tired of <UNK> snakes on this <UNK> plane months from now from idiots trying to be funny its crappy plot crap acting etc its okay to love a bad movie but you still gotta admit its a bad movie br br wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie
<START> after seeing dick tracy in the 6 99 bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of mafia and crime movies i was very surprised to see a very fun smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout the movie moves along well it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty but the real <UNK> of the film are al pacino and madonna i was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city madonna was great as the damsel in distress she really impressed me and added depth to her performance if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give dick tracy a try i don't think you will be disappointed and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino james <UNK> kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others
<START> be careful with this one once you get <UNK> <UNK> on it it'll change the way you look at kung fu flicks you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung fu films now you will be wanting character depth and development you will be <UNK> mystery and <UNK> you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops sadly you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung fu movie except for five deadly <UNK> br br easily the best kung fu movie of all time <UNK> <UNK> a rich plot full of twists and turns with colourful and developed characters along with some of the best <UNK> to come out of the 70s the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to <UNK> which character is which and who <UNK> in what <UNK> one is the <UNK> two is the snake three is the <UNK> four is the lizard and five is the <UNK> each character has different traits characteristics strengths and weaknesses <UNK> lies the hook we learn along with the student character finding out who these different men turn out to be we are in his shoes so to speak and we have to pick who we trust and who we don't just like he does we learn along with him br br not only is the plot the characters and the <UNK> great it's also fun to watch which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it's kind it's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that's going on <UNK> is a lesson on what kung fu can really do just don't expect many other kung fu films to live up to it's <UNK>
<START> think stage play this is worth seeing once for the performances of lionel <UNK> and dwight frye compare the melvyn douglas in ghost story with the melvyn douglas of this film are there vampires at loose in this <UNK> village or is there a more natural albeit equally sinister explanation dwight frye is herman a red <UNK> who is cast as an especially moronic character it's fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character not much happens for a long time but then we discover that <UNK> <UNK> smoking doctor is the real murderer there is too much <UNK> <UNK> but that is par for the course for this era fay <UNK> looks really good
<START> budget limitations time <UNK> shooting a script and then cutting it cutting it cutting it this crew is a group of good young filmmakers thoughtful in this script yes <UNK> clever in zero dollar effects when time and knowledge is all you have relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time devotion locations and getting a first feature in the can a 1 in 1000 thing these guys make films good ones check out their shorts collection <UNK> horrors and see the development and i can <UNK> working with them is about the most fun thing you'll do in the business i'm <UNK> by harsh insulting criticism for this film wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue <UNK> one thought or concept or if all that was desired of this work was the visual gore of bashing and <UNK> to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience let the empty <UNK> bring itself to you don't <UNK> what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the horror thriller genre due to its supernatural premise it's a drama with depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a <UNK> for a message that doesn't assault your <UNK> visual center but rather draws upon one's <UNK> imagination to experience other's suffering of mind and spirit mark <UNK> curtis the empty <UNK>
<START> after racism rural <UNK> also known as <UNK> from the country side is another <UNK> political issue of the 1960s <UNK> story had dealt with racism by a love feast in an artistic view now midnight cowboy deals with rural <UNK> by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view it has a deeply <UNK> ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away br br director john <UNK> <UNK> deliver us the deepest secret thoughts dreams fantasies fears and <UNK> of two new york city <UNK> while the handsome joe buck voight dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy the poor ratso rizzo hoffman dreams of a better and <UNK> life in clean and sunny florida <UNK> joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality and ratso becomes a <UNK> to collect enough money to <UNK> into florida besides ratso helps joe to find his way to do whatever he can they begin sharing everything in life they share food they share medicine they share an <UNK> home they share their <UNK> and thus they share a destiny <UNK> as the story progresses joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun and moreover ratso cannot see florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there br br the might is always right and the feeble has no right in the daylight <UNK> midnight gives the factual sight br br despite the tragedy there is no melodrama in midnight cowboy every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate thanks to this midnight cowboy is a provocative view of a <UNK> political issue the rural <UNK>
<START> spoilers alert br br <UNK> bound the incredible journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4 year old <UNK> the story is based on the sheila <UNK> novel and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless <UNK> clone br br the basic story two dogs and a cat happily live in the <UNK> family when the new husband to the mother of the three children gets a job in the city and they have to <UNK> move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong and shadow the golden <UNK> and sassy the <UNK> cat are <UNK> as the children are though the young and happy go lucky american <UNK> known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical due in part to his voice over explaining his being abandoned as a <UNK> picked up to an animal shelter and being bought by the family though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling br br the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness fantastic wilderness settings by the way driven on by <UNK> instincts of direction they meet several <UNK> along the way hoping to make it home while the family and the ranch <UNK> are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance there are funny moments all the way through great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines see memorable quotes and a touching <UNK> that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling <UNK> by moments of sadness such as when <UNK> arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a <UNK> leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers br br somehow though i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take somehow it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story br br the ending <UNK> the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a <UNK> and having hurt his leg finds it hard to get out and gives up exhausted followed by chance climbing in with him to <UNK> him to climb out telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily br br the way that this scene brilliantly done isn't <UNK> leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home but shadow is nowhere to be seen then just as all seems lost he slowly appears and is reunited with the family <UNK> conclusion at the end speaks of the <UNK> that has developed between he and his <UNK> on the journey and the <UNK> to what home really is from his long journey to get there leaves a fine <UNK> to demonstrate how much his character has grown but also how the other two have as well hang on a second i think i'm going to cry br br anyway i haven't read sheila <UNK> book so i don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie but this is a film that all the family can watch and while the <UNK> will love the talking animals older viewers will understand the plot line better as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it this film is a masterpiece in cinema and i suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it br br and please avoid the sequel see my review for <UNK> bound ii
<START> what did i just watch i spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen the concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of <UNK> but having it be a 300 pound <UNK> rhyme <UNK> killer clown makes a mockery of the genre i still am wondering how the character mark wasn't able to run away from the clown he's 300 pounds he's gotta get tired eventually the whole ending made me get up and literally say <UNK> what did i just watch apparently brandon is <UNK> cousin and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin yeah that's something people want so see <UNK> br br another thing i found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says what did you do well <UNK> what do you think he just did the last thing that was <UNK> funny was one second the main character was <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and calling her a c <UNK> and then 5 minutes later saying violence isn't helping anything did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy none of this movie makes sense anyway br br the movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which i got sucked into buying all 3 99 and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes i'm surprised the fat clown didn't join the orgy would have fit right in i hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other b movies might have but i was wrong this is a moronic piece of garbage that's not even worth watching br br 1 out of 10
<START> i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable i can see why it hasn't been <UNK> anytime recently more specifically this mini has some serious problems such as br br 1 it is terribly miscast the actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters ali <UNK> 45 at the time was playing natalie <UNK> who was supposed to be about 26 jan michael vincent <UNK> at the time was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about 22 the other henry children and pamela <UNK> were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their <UNK> br br 2 some of the acting was absolutely awful ali <UNK> at times almost made this mini unwatchable i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays br br 3 the directing was poor to be fair to ali <UNK> the bad acting and character development were probably the directing the portrayal of hitler was way overdone his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic sometimes charming but always diabolical genius herman <UNK> painted him as in the novel some of the other characters are done so <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they do not gain the depth of character that <UNK> created for them br br 4 this mini is very dated the hokey music the pretentious narration it sounded like a junior high school history film narration and the entire prime time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times also too often byron and natalie are <UNK> and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939 br br someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all because it will come off more as a late 70's early 80's take myself too seriously prime time soap drama rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classic br br remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning memorable and <UNK> acclaimed production i don't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long 15 hours or longer to do it right and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public it wouldn't fly
<START> midnight cowboy was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic you know it's a classic the moment its <UNK> theme song <UNK> <UNK> starts up on the soundtrack actually not written for the film and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck naked and in the shower we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who's to doubt him this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else his performance here would still be legendary as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well <UNK> as his performance in that glorious rubbish <UNK> is a source of pleasure br br the film became famous and infamous almost overnight it was a crowd <UNK> even with its downbeat ending funny and sexy and <UNK> <UNK> it was the tail end of the sixties and all the characters <UNK> true it was also the first <UNK> rated film to win the oscar as the year's best picture adapted brilliantly by <UNK> salt from a james leo <UNK> novel it was probably the first main stream commercial american movie to deal with <UNK> subjects such as homosexuality and drug taking in a matter of fact manner everyone is <UNK> human <UNK> and all and everyone is treated <UNK> <UNK> joe buck is an innocent abroad a <UNK> who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he's a cross between a <UNK> and a social worker but when he himself is <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> little con man called <UNK> rizzo dustin hoffman fresh from the graduate and he's a revelation he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the <UNK> dream br br essentially it's a male love story though totally <UNK> between these two not so unlikely <UNK> both totally alone both totally <UNK> each becomes the <UNK> of the other voight with his physical <UNK> hoffman with his street wise <UNK> they are <UNK> <UNK> from the mainstream <UNK> of their own <UNK> and the <UNK> of others though <UNK> voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a <UNK> street cinema with a boy even <UNK> than himself the whole film <UNK> a strangely <UNK> attitude br br it's also <UNK> acted while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda <UNK> and sylvia miles as well as john <UNK> bob <UNK> and bernard hughes as <UNK> customers and <UNK> on beautifully <UNK> little character studies that seem to <UNK> acting altogether while john <UNK> direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an <UNK> totally detached eye view of the american under belly without <UNK> and without criticism on second thoughts maybe it is a great movie after all
<START> this is easily the most underrated film <UNK> the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of <UNK> unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of <UNK> singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most <UNK> <UNK> members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead
<START> i am generally more willing to be open minded about <UNK> <UNK> than many but this was simply not a very good attempt its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original have not seen and doubt i will it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot lack of chemistry between the leads and a <UNK> performance character from its supposed male lead jimmy fallon br br fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and <UNK> of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that he's supposed to be a teacher you see and of course its well known that school <UNK> the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they <UNK> to teach the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable but old <UNK> like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot not fallon who is neither funny nor an actor but appears to think he is both not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role or believe that there is any way these two people should or would be together near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone its hard to have a one person romance tells fallon that its over too much has happened and she's moving on and rather than feeling bad about the scene or sorry for fallon you are <UNK> cheering her on finally she does what she should have done months ago but of course the plot <UNK> won't allow that to be the end of it an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his <UNK> its of course meant to be <UNK> and satisfying but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else
<START> i realize this review will get me <UNK> by the expert film critics <UNK> this site but i will defend this film br br the dentist is actually a really good film the acting isn't always top notch but the thrills are good and the story's good plus you see linda <UNK> <UNK> not that i'm an expert in this field but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense corbin makes a great creepy dentist it does to <UNK> what jaws does to sharks ish it obviously had a fairly limited budget but they did well with it what they could and developed the characters well those that count br br the end
<START> <UNK> closet has the emotional power of kramer vs kramer combined with the imagination of <UNK> <UNK> even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to <UNK> <UNK> but this is a story that takes place in modern times not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more <UNK> today <UNK> closet is about a boy an only child practically alone on summer vacation dealing with his family falling apart it's a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense a horror movie for the thinking person if you're looking for a slasher movie this won't be your cup of tea but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting this is the movie for you at the screening i saw i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed i highly recommend catching this film
<START> paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film i've ever seen often <UNK> as a horror movie this i believe is a grave error some <UNK> once called it the thinking person's nightmare on elm street and while i accept the logic of his conclusion i can't help but think it's a tag that is ill deserved and misleading those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they're really not thinking at all br br in fact just attempting to <UNK> this wonderful work is probably a bad idea quite simply paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart as someone <UNK> than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so <UNK> <UNK> to be honest i make no <UNK> for this so if you feel my words are too <UNK> for your taste stop reading now because there's more to come br br it's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and <UNK> of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely <UNK> us at this fragile time in our lives even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work in charlotte burke and elliott <UNK> we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood often overlooked in a <UNK> and convincing way br br and yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away br br add to all this an incredibly talented director bernard rose imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an <UNK> of why i have such affection and <UNK> for this film that no amount of words can express br br
<START> japan is in serious trouble demons have <UNK> <UNK> taking possession of <UNK> forms and <UNK> them to their <UNK> will on top of that the <UNK> of <UNK> queen of the demons is <UNK> the only thing that stands against this grave threat are the demon <UNK> a <UNK> group of warriors who might just be as bad as the demons themselves br br <UNK> is a retired demon warden who five years ago took up theater instead of demon <UNK> after accidentally killing a innocent child in a battle that's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from <UNK> till dawn one night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> literally and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies br br if you think this sounds like your typical japanese fantasy <UNK> epic you'd be wrong in fact there's nothing typical about <UNK> it is a <UNK> <UNK> of many different <UNK> of film those just mentioned as well as a comedy drama and romance director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> fairly <UNK> although the comedy seems forced in some scenes and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn movie br br to be sure there are flaws in the film some of the humor seems contrived and out of place and the acting isn't the greatest but seriously do you watch fantasy <UNK> comedy films for the great acting performances no we watch them for the action and the crazy cg visuals all of which <UNK> has in <UNK> not to be misleading the film is not all action but it is <UNK> out <UNK> enough with lots of <UNK> and <UNK> of green blood to keep the average viewer happy br br bottom line the films has it's faults and is not a martial arts epic but it doesn't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good <UNK> action the reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly <UNK> fantasy action flick br br my rating 7 out of 10 fun popcorn movie
<START> this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time <UNK> kennedy was and is still is a <UNK> beautiful inspiration not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful <UNK> out there but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and <UNK> his love watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart wrenching listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming and seeing him smile was <UNK> i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant please if you ever have a chance to watch this film consider yourself lucky to have met <UNK> kennedy
<START> i've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last i could manage to see it in <UNK> film festival maybe because i expected too much from this film and that's why i was slightly disappointed i was not the best movie from korea but still it is really worth watching br br the subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long but there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another however the acting of <UNK> do <UNK> is incredibly beautiful it was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and i think this movie wouldn't be that nice if she was not in the leading role
<START> i wouldn't normally write a comment on line but this is the worst movie i've ever seen not only that it's filmed just like a soap series the young and the restless is really filmed by professionals compared to this but it also has awful cuts it has no action it is full of useless garbage br br here's an example a guy wants to kill the main character as he got fired because of him so after loads of crap here they are the guy puts a knife at his throat and says something like you're dead now then the main character says if you kill me you're dead i've told the police you're threatening me so the killer guy goes like just about to cry oh no the cops are following me oh my god br br remember this is just an example i really cannot believe this movie actually exists so if you want to see the worst movie ever go ahead i recommend it
<START> when i heard about hammerhead being released on dvd and finally found it at my local dvd store i thought well just another cheap monster movie from <UNK> image those guys around <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> produced cheap but very entertaining b pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies so i didn't expect much especially after having watched the rather disappointing shark zone just a few days before but hammerhead turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies we have a mad scientist a group of people in a dangerous situation screaming women and <UNK> in distress man eating plants and of course we have the creature a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark everything you need for an entertaining monster movie the only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind but since the movie was made for tv it's understandable why these scenes are missing and it doesn't matter anyway cause hammerhead is action and horror entertainment at it's best there are two reasons why i gave it seven out of ten points though first of all the monster isn't seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done and secondly william forsythe just isn't the right guy for the hero part and for falling in love with gorgeous hunter <UNK> other than that i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn watch this movie and have fun <UNK> p morgan
<START> a sequel to actually a remake of disney's 1996 live action remake of 101 <UNK> cruella devil glenn close is released from prison after being <UNK> of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named dr <UNK> ugh but the cure is broken when cruella hears the <UNK> of big ben and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of <UNK> hides br br this movie is bad on so many levels starting with the fact that it's a <UNK> family schlock movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the disney marketing machine glenn close over over over over acts as cruella with all that she had to put up with in this movie the lame script the endless makeup getting baked in a cake at the end i hope they gave her an extremely large paycheck br br speaking of which where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory a <UNK> with a <UNK> goldberg <UNK> line and a <UNK> restaurant all located within the same building as you do in the climax of this film of course the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs they serve as the <UNK> <UNK> of this movie pulling all the stupid home alone gags on the villains biting them in the <UNK> running over their hands with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> them with <UNK> etc etc etc ad <UNK> i have to admit the dogs were fairly good actors much better than the humans br br gerard depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked out french <UNK> the two human dog lovers <UNK> from the earlier film but with different actors are completely boring when they have a spaghetti dinner at an italian restaurant the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home watching the dinner scene from lady and the tramp i thought to myself oh please don't go there i half expected the humans to do a satire on the lady and the tramp dinner scene as charlie sheen did in hot shots part <UNK> doing the spaghetti <UNK> kiss pushing the <UNK> with his nose etc br br and don't get me started on the annoying parrot with eric <UNK> voice br br the costumes were nominated for an oscar and the costumes in the movie are good but they are the only good thing in the movie the rest of it is unbearable dreck
<START> i really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas <UNK> brought out in her novel we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine <UNK> this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating don't see this movie if you are a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> because you will be sorely disappointed however if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes or educational as was my case then it is an alright movie
<START> we first watched this film as part of a festival of new <UNK> films in 2000 at the walter <UNK> although we liked it we didn't think it was extraordinary watching it for a second time we found a different meaning in this look at life in <UNK> <UNK> br br the film takes place in one of the darkest days of <UNK> as the <UNK> administration was ending the country was in turmoil after the economy which had <UNK> earlier in the 1990s under the <UNK> climate president <UNK> created it was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare br br the story begins just as <UNK> a bank employee is fired because the collapse of the economy instead of receiving sympathy from his wife she locks him out of the apartment and he for all practical purposes becomes a homeless man he takes to the streets trying to make ends meet br br the other story introduces us to ariel a young jew <UNK> for a job in a spanish company it's almost a miracle he gets the job his father simon owns a small restaurant in the jewish quarter of el once in the center of the city things go from bad to worse when <UNK> mother dies suddenly only <UNK> the young woman who is in love with ariel comes to help father and son br br <UNK> who is a clean man has to resort to take <UNK> wherever he can he chooses a <UNK> room in one of the subway stations when the attendant elsa finds him naked she becomes furious but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times they become <UNK> involved and <UNK> in one of his <UNK> through the street garbage finds an <UNK> elsa while surprised wants to do the right thing but <UNK> convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will <UNK> their love br br ariel who has met the gorgeous laura at work begins a <UNK> and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co worker who unknown to him is involved in a lesbian affair ariel who free <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> and other occasions feels a passion for laura but he realizes what <UNK> has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him br br daniel <UNK> whose el <UNK> <UNK> we thought was excellent did wonders with this film things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around if anything this second time the nuances of the screen play mr <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> wrote make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days br br daniel <UNK> who plays ariel has <UNK> with mr <UNK> before to surprising results he is not <UNK> star <UNK> yet he is handsome this actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work <UNK> <UNK> is another magnificent surprise his <UNK> is <UNK> in spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him he keeps a <UNK> attitude toward everyone he meets <UNK> <UNK> the interesting italian actress makes a great contribution to the film with her elsa hector <UNK> one of the best <UNK> actors plays the small part of simon the gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> is seen as laura and <UNK> <UNK> appears as the noble <UNK> br br <UNK> al <UNK> proves daniel <UNK> is a voice to be <UNK> with in the <UNK> cinema
<START> lol delirious was so funny i was in tears eddie <UNK> impressions are absolutely spot on the best impression was of james brown and mr t so funny its weird how eddie murphy was back then and how he is now delirious is a must see but if u don't like foul language don't watch but amazing and so funny i have seen it 6 7 times and still pee myself every time this is eddie murphy at his prime and you can see where he got the humour and ideas of movies such as nutty professor from he does impressions of his family as well which is real funny br br if only i was there
<START> this is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on dvd br br television moved out of my life in 1981 so i never followed the series or any part of it which means that i'm <UNK> to the nostalgic charm that <UNK> appears to have for most reviewers br br possible spoiler warning br br the pilot of <UNK> is your basic <UNK> meets <UNK> yarn where a charming red blooded he man <UNK> a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs the premises that the <UNK> wit is based on must have already felt stale around 1950 it also contains some frankly bad writing as in the scene where <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> instead of shooting the villain strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of <UNK> assistance br br i often feel that susan <UNK> <UNK> in seeing male <UNK> conspiracy in simple entertainment but in this particular case i'm all with her <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> all over it br br in one sense however this dvd is a must for all serious bruce willis fans in addition to the pilot episode it contains the screen test that landed willis the job both features show to what amazing extent <UNK> acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988 <UNK> die hard 1 in country impressive br br rating and i am a bruce willis fan 2 out of 10
<START> this is the first michael <UNK> movie i've seen i haven't seen <UNK> and i was curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likable in this movie natasha <UNK> is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles so i found her very good and lovable in this different sweet role of a <UNK> some of the negative comments i read are true the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all also even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together i don't think there is screen chemistry there however i enjoyed this movie the locales are nice the characters are likable and <UNK> and the supporting actors are pretty good if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innocent <UNK> movie with likable characters its very good
<START> this is an interesting little flick made in 1967 with cool <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh ok it's not really stupid but it's cheesy fun i saw many similarities between this and <UNK> with the blue <UNK> aka the bloody dead and they do have the same director scotland <UNK> finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college seems that criminals are being let loose from a local prison to do the <UNK> of some evil person and then returned when their work is done there's a nifty device hidden inside a bible that <UNK> <UNK> acid and there's another device that is neither nifty nor <UNK> it looks like a large <UNK> gun and the victim must be pretty near <UNK> before they <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays an inspector and he mostly <UNK> <UNK> and looks off into the distance there's a monk and how anyone <UNK> this thing as a monk is beyond me it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood more of a <UNK> member of a different color than a monk there's all kinds of nifty devices like a <UNK> <UNK> that goes up and down to admit the monk and it steps right over the fire without setting his <UNK> <UNK> a nifty trick right there this is an odd <UNK> of crime drama with goofy overtones and while it's rather silly at times it is fun to watch 7 out of 10 not bad
<START> conventional wisdom is that a sequel is seldom as good as the original movie there are occasional exceptions but this is not one of them disney should have quit while they were ahead this was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining 101 <UNK>
<START> i must be that one guy in america that didn't like this movie i guess this just wasn't my style or something i just don't see what's so fascinating about it this was barely entertaining let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history br br it's about a guy that came from nothing and goes on to become a drug lord pretty simple way to describe an entire movie and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie contrary to what a lot of people think just because a movie is about <UNK> drug trade criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie don't forget good storytelling
<START> i found this to be a charming adaptation very lively and full of fun with the exception of a couple of major errors the cast is wonderful i have to echo some of the earlier comments <UNK> phillips is horribly miscast as a teenager at 27 she's just too old and yes it does show and lacks the singing chops for broadway style music vanessa williams is a decent enough singer and for a non dancer she's adequate however she is not <UNK> and her character definitely is she's also very <UNK> throughout which gets tiresome br br the girls of sweet <UNK> conrad <UNK> fan club really <UNK> with special kudos to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i also enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> performance though i'm not generally a fan of her work finally the dancing <UNK> are a riot especially the <UNK> three in the bar br br the movie is suitable for the whole family and i highly recommend it
<START> reading through all these positive reviews i find myself <UNK> how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel there are many problems with the film already mentioned in a few reviews simply put it is a <UNK> up over acted <UNK> mess from opening credits to butchered ending br br while many characters are <UNK> cast and neither ewan <UNK> nor toni collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them the worst by far is paltrow i have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles but here she is <UNK> she is self conscious <UNK> <UNK> and entirely <UNK> from her characters and those around her an extremely disappointing effort though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film
<START> paul armstrong is a liberal scottish born professor of law at <UNK> known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of <UNK> <UNK> an eleven year old white girl earl claims that his confession to the crime was <UNK> under <UNK> by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row hoping to <UNK> him to confess to <UNK> murder thereby saving earl from the electric chair br br at first all goes well sullivan <UNK> and earl is released from prison when the appeal court <UNK> his conviction as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film it is at this point that alarm <UNK> will start <UNK> in the mind of the viewer warning major plot twist ahead and so it proves the anticipated twist soon <UNK> earl it <UNK> is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been <UNK> and probably of several others as well but <UNK> a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom sullivan will confess to <UNK> murder if earl will murder his parents just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved earl has a grudge against <UNK> wife herself a lawyer who acted as <UNK> for the <UNK> in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape br br just cause is an example of the auto <UNK> in which hollywood sometimes likes to <UNK> <UNK> together one film by <UNK> themes and plot devices from a number of others the first half owes an obvious debt to films like intruder in the dust and to kill a <UNK> about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black whereas in earlier films he would have been white police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity the central twist in the plot was borrowed from <UNK> <UNK> music box although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end the finale in which a lawyer his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client is an obvious <UNK> of the two versions of cape fear which also take place in the <UNK> of the american south ed <UNK> characterisation of sullivan as a bible <UNK> religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de <UNK> character in the scorsese version of cape fear made four years before just cause br br there is a <UNK> just as just cause borrowed heavily from several other movies seven years later its central plot twist was in its turn to be blatantly <UNK> in the ashley judd vehicle high crimes br br the trouble with this style of film making by numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts and just cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were <UNK> to make it harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max <UNK> blair <UNK> is ok as bobby earl the supposedly innocent young man of the early scenes but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better but neither is good enough to save the film connery and harris were to act together in another better film the rock the following year br br there is another problem with just cause the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie anti death penalty anti racist and critical of heavy handed <UNK> the second half looks more like the work of a die hard <UNK> preaching the message that all criminals are evil <UNK> that the only way to deal with them is to <UNK> them in the chair that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal <UNK> and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be <UNK> as heroes the filmmakers seem to have been <UNK> unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the presumably <UNK> effect of <UNK> its political stance or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political <UNK> 4 10
<START> will smith is one of the best actors of all time i don't know how he does it i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head amazing and sad all at the same time thanks again will you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie you cannot miss a thing make sure you have plenty of <UNK> and your man woman sitting next to you so you can <UNK> well worth the money that you will pay to watch it don't wait for it to come on tv
<START> a spaceship returns from mars about a couple of months earlier a 4 person expedition had been sent to the red planet most of the picture is a flashback to what <UNK> over there the picture is <UNK> by inane melodramatic dialog typical of many sci fi efforts of the fifties sixties note for example how the <UNK> commander <UNK> tells another crew member to <UNK> <UNK> for no reason as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem later the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside the two he ordered to stay say <UNK> <UNK> and follow out i didn't have high hopes for the <UNK> success by this point there's much talk of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a freeze ray gun named <UNK> short for <UNK> of course it would at least be pretty funny unintentionally if the story didn't drag br br there's a very slow pace to the whole thing the <UNK> spend as much time looking out the <UNK> window <UNK> which change color from red to blue commenting on what they see as they do outside actually exploring the martian landscape advertised as filmed in <UNK> ' usually resembles animation cut outs or drawings shot through an orange red <UNK> to give the illusion of <UNK> with the actors who do take on an odd <UNK> appearance due to the process but i don't think it fools anyone over 10 years old the one clever mention i did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be <UNK> with <UNK> so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian <UNK> oh okay br br i was amused by some of the <UNK> actions as they begin to explore right off the bat they test their freeze gun on a plant killing it just for the hell of it then the female member <UNK> with a <UNK> at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spider rat monster nice going lady look up next time no wonder the <UNK> on mars gets upset and doesn't mind that one of the lower <UNK> a giant <UNK> attacks the <UNK> the acting isn't too impressive <UNK> especially had a very annoying technique saying a line and then abruptly <UNK> into a huge grin which always <UNK> me out reminded me of it the terror from beyond space the ending is fairly anti climactic don't expect any huge revelations beyond the <UNK> more <UNK> with freeze guns named <UNK>
<START> i simply love this movie i also love the ramones so i am sorta biased to begin with in the first place there isn't a lot of critical praise to give this film either you like it or you don't i think it's a great cult movie
<START> i'm still new to the <UNK> genre and the only one i've seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing 'the dead eyes of <UNK> which didn't exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me if i'd seen this one first however the feeling would have been different as while the college girl murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick it's great fun to watch and it's really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style the film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack this poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison and then has them put back in jail as the title suggests it's a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims there's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red <UNK> who <UNK> around breaking <UNK> with a <UNK> br br of course with a plot like that this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongue in cheek vibe to the film which does <UNK> well with the plot the fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly although this isn't a big problem as things are kept <UNK> over nicely throughout the film and there's always enough going on to keep the audience interested the atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at of course the film is based on an edgar wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination the locations used are also superb and while a killer's <UNK> <UNK> out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot it does help to give the film that extra <UNK> you cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax overall college girl murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended
<START> as an animated film from 1978 this is pretty good generally well above the standard of the days when disney hadn't done anything good in years and <UNK> cared little for disney anyway it gets major points for innovative and careful camera work <UNK> cinematic techniques with relative success the much <UNK> <UNK> actually works pretty well especially with the <UNK> and the opening narration however it is so drastically <UNK> possibly as a money saving technique that it <UNK> from the overall effect the same technique that makes <UNK> spooky and <UNK> doesn't fare so well in the <UNK> <UNK> br br as for the adaptation of the story it's actually quite good we lose little bits here and there minor details such as the old forest and tom <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> we <UNK> a few characters such as <UNK> <UNK> as one of <UNK> household and an old friend of <UNK> but that's a rather wise decision for film in books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the <UNK> and middle <UNK> vast history in film you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way nothing critical is truly lost here and although i have minor <UNK> about some of the changes i'm generally pretty happy with it br br if only the <UNK> writers had managed to remember <UNK> name he's frequently referred to as <UNK> a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly named <UNK> it took me a second viewing before i was certain i hadn't <UNK> it it's also annoying that <UNK> is a bloody stage <UNK> and <UNK> from the start however <UNK> is excellent and most of the rest of the <UNK> is excellent if only john hurt weren't too old to play <UNK> i love his voice br br of course with the film ending at the <UNK> of the story there's a vast disappointment built in what makes it far far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the <UNK> bass crew on the sequel that they were <UNK> to do return of the king after <UNK> the <UNK> remains a huge mystery they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling for all its faults this film's heart is <UNK> in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task i can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision
<START> since the start of her career in the 70's and vastly throughout the <UNK> 80's elvira <UNK> peterson has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror bad monster movies while ms peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures covering a wide variety in genres it was her tv character elvira that brought her the most fame part of her charm  and respect from the fans  lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous unlike many other big name actors actresses that like to <UNK> themselves from their early work i've seen only bits pieces of her tv performances but her cameo role in <UNK> recent tribute song mistress of the dark really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video over the years elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid 80's came around br br and in 1988 after films like fright night and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to and spoofs on her tv work it finally happened elvira mistress of the dark the motion picture now i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film a few years ago i did manage to watch <UNK> haunted hills made in 2001 but for some reason it didn't impress me all that much was it really that forgettable or should i give it another watch i actually really do feel like re watching it now as this first elvira film from <UNK> really convinced me though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work might be sam <UNK> and john <UNK> with their <UNK> to the script there really is no way to deny it <UNK> peterson has a great feel for comedy she also co wrote the screenplay br br when elvira learns she's one of the <UNK> of a great aunt she never heard of before she takes it as the long <UNK> opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas out to claim her rightfully inherited money she travels to a quiet new england town but the uptight <UNK> of <UNK> are in for a treat in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her often unintentionally provocative behaviour to make things worse her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected a <UNK> mansion a <UNK> and a <UNK> but what she doesn't know and her evil uncle vincent <UNK> does is that her great aunt was a witch and the <UNK> contains <UNK> to <UNK> the most <UNK> dark powers imaginable and if you haven't turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has <UNK> up her first dish from the recipe book then rest assured you're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face br br it's surprising how a script <UNK> together with <UNK> jokes witty one liners movie references inside jokes and <UNK> taste <UNK> also manages to tell a coherent story simple of course but coherent while other movies heavily relying on gag like situations often make you loose track of the story completely like the naked gun films for example this film doesn't a lot of horror comedies were being produced during the 80's but not a lot of them actually worked let alone a horror spoof that doesn't <UNK> at some point killer party although i'm grateful for this one going completely <UNK> during the finale or becomes too tedious too quickly saturday the <UNK> although elvira is more comedy than horror it doesn't loose track of what it's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of <UNK> between <UNK> witch elvira and evil uncle wizard <UNK> including a real honest to god witch hunt and <UNK> very own burn at the stake moment br br i'm telling you there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny one of the first <UNK> i got was during the opening credits already when daniel <UNK> name appeared daniel who oh yes i recognized his name and later on his dim witted macho face how can one not forget daniel greene once you've seen atomic cyborg aka <UNK> of steel but if you haven't seen atomic cyborg then i'm sorry but you won't be able to laugh with his face in this one and on a side note i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while <UNK> driving away from a gas station even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better
<START> very rarely does one come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression cross eyed is a rare gem the writer director not only <UNK> the challenge of directing his own work but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate the script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you can't help but commit to ernie as a character very funny stuff despite the tiny budget adam jones manages to give the film a serious look he's not messing around when it comes to making a good movie i can't wait to see what he comes up with next this guy can make people laugh and think that's special
<START> this norwegian movie is so crap the actors can not act cause they seems to be reading from a book and the story is so wannabe hollywood the only actor who did a ok job was <UNK> <UNK> 3 10 if you want a really good norwegian movie watch buddy great actors and a <UNK> story 9 10
<START> ghost story the new house is a terrific horror story this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early seventies the beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian <UNK> remember him from the early family series family affair in the 1960s this particular story has barbara <UNK> and david <UNK> as the lead actors and as the main characters in the story i saw this recently and i was so scared if you are alone i would not recommend that you watch this this story is terrific no gore or curse words but very scary barbara <UNK> played the young bride david <UNK> played her husband both actors were very good in their parts if you like scary fun terrifying ghost stories then you will like this little gem i gave this a high rating i highly recommend this story
<START> this movie is pretty cheesy but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it's principles there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well br br the <UNK> assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie br br i guess i really like the idea of what <UNK> a veteran will go for a fellow veteran sure it's not all that well done but the premise is not at all bad br br tom
<START> gandhi my father is like viewing a book chapter by chapter you read it with your eyes and you learn more about harilal gandhi and for that matter <UNK> gandhi so little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely the title <UNK> though its as much a movie about <UNK> <UNK> gandhi and his son as its about harilal and his mother and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> do full justice to their respective roles br br such movies are like leap years they come after only so much time br br gandhi my father is also about an internal struggle which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever <UNK> br br watch it if you like quality cinema
<START> in order to hold the <UNK> attention for three hours we were treated not so much to a family's romp through four generations and <UNK> years of hungarian history as to sexual <UNK> with a sister a sister in law and other <UNK> oh yes there was also a totally gratuitous rape having said all this the first story of the relationship among the children of the <UNK> was fresh and sensual thanks to jennifer <UNK>
<START> i've always liked fred macmurray <UNK> her career was <UNK> cut <UNK> think carole lombard is fun to watch pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like jean dixon anthony quinn dorothy <UNK> and charles <UNK> give them a romantic script team them with noted director mitchell <UNK> and you <UNK> mediocre movie experience br br <UNK> johnson fred and maggie carole meet cute during her visit to the <UNK> <UNK> and spend the next few weeks falling in love <UNK> a great <UNK> so he <UNK> on a musical career which is predictably <UNK> in both its rise and fall during his climb to musical stardom he <UNK> maggie who later <UNK> him to start over after he's hit rock bottom ah <UNK> the true hollywood happy ending which comes none too soon br br stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that it's difficult to watch at times the early scenes set in <UNK> are so <UNK> that they seem to go on forever and later an alcoholic <UNK> just wanders endlessly in new york fred and carole try their best but the tired script and s l o w direction just don't give them a chance even the final scene in which maggie encourages <UNK> to rise from the <UNK> of alcohol and disappointment just doesn't ring true br br this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard however i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours
<START> just caught it at the toronto international film festival this is a good story told in a compelling way the <UNK> camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes in a documentary style not a blair witch style joel <UNK> shows he doesn't need a big budget to produce a gripping film br br the actors were strong particularly the actor playing the focus of the events in the film <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are <UNK> and <UNK> down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience it stars richard widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and <UNK> conflict that really seems like no big deal at all br br the plot is preposterous its time for the institution to get new <UNK> for the library windows one old woman wants to have her <UNK> put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own and somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart it sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children br br the questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real like lunatic could buy it don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the acting the cast following widmark is composed of other great actors many of them academy award <UNK> and winners and there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always <UNK> the stupid plot about window <UNK> unfortunately there is too much about the <UNK> <UNK> and thus the movie slows down a lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint <UNK> to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest br br in a short analysis the <UNK> is an <UNK> film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly it just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch
<START> i'm surprised this movie is rated so highly although if i were to go with typical grade scale <UNK> is a c or d so perhaps that's all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except <UNK> slow and unrealistic not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to and yet the woman who got <UNK> didn't press charges because she didn't want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn't even know there were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill beat <UNK> before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since <UNK> ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for <UNK> to actually rape his daughter so he could do something <UNK> about it would be a bit absurd so now i've just <UNK> more of my life for this stupid movie so please don't see it so at least your life won't be <UNK> and that way my 2 1 2 hours or so has meant something
<START> what ends up killing this movie is its self consciousness among other things here's a short list 1 <UNK> behavior when the beatles came over and <UNK> their brand of quirky <UNK> behavior humor it was <UNK> as fresh that was over 4 decades ago get over it br br 2 false sophistication <UNK> out base quasi <UNK> political <UNK> is hard ground to make work <UNK> ask woody allen br br 3 the post modern i'm hard on this phony world and yes i recognize it in myself snake eating itself used as <UNK> with another animal in the film itself is such a <UNK> br br 4 smarmy smug <UNK> br br 5 amateurish writing acting direction ever seen student films a victim of itself about the only thing i can say positive is that it at least has a sense of itself and <UNK> now i'm getting caught up in the self <UNK> thing that it <UNK> as worthwhile of value br br but towards what ultimately it just rings as hollow as any other pretentious piece hey ever see woody allen's take on bergman ie interiors well this just does it more <UNK>
<START> in this short an urban man and his wife have their weird lives set <UNK> when the man takes to wearing an old red pants suit of his mother in <UNK> br br i kept watching this hoping that i could see why it had been made or why the other reviewers found it funny for me it was a total waste of time br br not everyone's tastes are the same but this was clearly not to mine
<START> easily 9 out of 10 for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire but don't watch this movie expecting to be entertained ang lee takes an objective look at a relatively <UNK> aspect of the civil war what is beautiful about the movie like all of lee's films is that he doesn't side with his characters he creates characters <UNK> them with life problems and ambiguity and <UNK> them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable this film has action but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous i e like the characters it is real and as you would expect about one of <UNK> most horrific wars the violence is horrific br br but as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely <UNK> within the civil war it is a masterpiece was the war about slavery and an <UNK> lee seems quite willing to <UNK> that line made so popular in depictions like the blue and the grey neither is about <UNK> though as seen in gone with the wind it is about freedom about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it as you watch the characters you will ask yourself how can they be fighting to <UNK> slavery the fact is i don't think they really are and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the <UNK> of the civil war br br the fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to home though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly <UNK> its values the letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle jake and daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits and when the tension finally <UNK> and these characters find themselves suddenly free we see the birth of new men br br all this mixed in with lee's beautiful <UNK> of <UNK> environment with breathtaking <UNK> and frames lee has a style which is his somehow european in its art a slow camera <UNK> asian in its epic <UNK> and development of story and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in north americans br br relax let go of your <UNK> about what the civil war is what the western as a genre is what a war movie should be and let ang lee take you into a world so fragile so hard so real that few of us can <UNK> see it br br in this lee continues what he <UNK> in ice storm again the movie is slow paced and without apparent direction a sure sign of lee's ability to direct without <UNK> himself on the story or screen his direction is <UNK> by what he brings out of jewel yes the singer a <UNK> <UNK> actress who puts in an amazing performance br br a movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard hollywood epic
<START> this is a good family show with a great cast of actors it's a nice break from the reality show <UNK> of late there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either unless you count joan of <UNK> as being similar because it has a teen lead character too anyway <UNK> is worth a look because jeremy <UNK> gives the main character pete young a kind of <UNK> and <UNK> that is appealing without being overly sweet and <UNK> dean cain christopher lloyd <UNK> <UNK> and kirsten <UNK> round out the rest of the main cast members and each is terrific in their role i really like kirsten <UNK> as <UNK> sister <UNK> she is quite a <UNK> but she still cares about her mom and brother even though she hates to show it it may take a few episodes to really find it's legs but <UNK> is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while so check it out people you'll be glad you did
<START> what the hell is this its one of the dumbest movies i've seen i don't understand why people on this site love it so much its senseless nudity for no reason its worst then resident evil i strongly don't <UNK> it unless you want to watch <UNK> bad acting crap watch real <UNK> movies such as stephen king's it the shining jurassic park kinda <UNK> jaws etc leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent it is bad as <UNK> vs <UNK> attack of the killer tomatoes is better then this crap br br oh wow flesh eating zombies how many damn <UNK> movies do we need skip this one br br outta
<START> what happened those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen nightmare on elm st had gone <UNK> downhill after it's cult classic of a first film but i doubt anybody expected this horrible <UNK> nobody expected this <UNK> joke of a film and nobody is more <UNK> about it than i am br br this is by far the worst <UNK> film of the lot it doesn't seem too bad at the beginning with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather <UNK> shower scene featuring alice but then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a <UNK> sequence of events i mean sure freddy movies are supposed to be <UNK> and creepy but this one is like a train wreck in it's poor <UNK> of events and awful plot setup it feels like you're coming down with a terrible headache not like you're getting scared so the directing totally fails none of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic the death by food especially except for that one cool scene that's crafted like a comic book battle that's why this movie gets a point br br the storyline lame lame lame lame it was an excuse to gross people out and to make the mpaa mad and nothing more br br the acting should i mention how freddy has been turned into a childish <UNK> man like clown figure how his <UNK> scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year <UNK> horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we've all known and <UNK> since the first film that arm waving and stupid <UNK> as he appeared again ugh and his one liners too throughout the whole movie they suck badly a grade <UNK> could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit freddy <UNK> throughout the 90 minute duration of the film hell a <UNK> could come up with much funnier lines than what freddy's been told to say here who wrote the script for this this movie is really irritating too it seems so pointless like a <UNK> <UNK> around your head a <UNK> that just won't go away freddy is just an annoyance now we've seen him so many times before this one's nothing different and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one liners and get off your tv screen alice instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie seems annoying and very shallow and this is obviously due to the horrible horrible script this movie was <UNK> with lisa <UNK> may be a great actor and sometimes it shines through the cracks here but she can't save this movie the other actors just suck mostly br br the last 15 or 20 minutes of freddy's existence in this film are awful and embarrassing i hope englund was ashamed of this who wants to see freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out laughing like a cartoon villain this movie destroyed anything positive i felt for the nightmare series i can't ever watch them again without this image running through my head of the <UNK> cartoon abomination that krueger became he was slowly becoming a <UNK> retarded pop culture icon but this is the lowest of the low this is rock bottom nobody will ever take freddy krueger seriously again after seeing this film he's <UNK> but a joke a clown that is long <UNK> for retirement pathetic br br of all the movies i could hate why did it have to be nightmare on elm st a series which i once <UNK> and liked a lot the dream child represents the death of a legend and the shattering of any hope i had in the nightmare on elm st series freddy would go on to continue his <UNK> spiral into clown status in the next installment freddy's dead which was more entertaining than this was actually and then he would go on to bring down the mood in freddy vs jason and finally he would <UNK> out into nothing which is for the best br br i know this has mostly been a rant about why freddy sucks now but this movie is overall horrible and one of the worst movies ever made not recommended to anyone and even <UNK> <UNK> won't want to see this one again
<START> i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie i can't believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money
<START> a large part of the scenes should be cut off there is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off for example the scene where the hunters mentions i got <UNK> on my dick i like dick playing in the mud scene or a bar scene where a professional <UNK> hunters main job is a snake <UNK> br br how about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman diane who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks like he wears women's <UNK> three <UNK> too small while they make love didn't they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head why did they do in a living room i mean his head really <UNK> how about the beach scene very reminiscent of steven spielberg's jaws scene at grant lake all these strange scene could easily be re dubbed and billed as a comedy br br here in my local town the <UNK> theaters had been advertising for months about <UNK> and i am glad i didn't watch it because i later found out it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled the movie was that bad i suspected that <UNK> was not a good movie looking at the preview it features the leg of <UNK> that looks like a child wearing green <UNK> and <UNK> with <UNK> and walks up and down like a 2 year old it could easily passed over as baby geniuses br br if any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash such as <UNK> boyfriend who walks like he had an advanced case of <UNK> makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before he get to drink beer when this happens who cares about <UNK> the <UNK> man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of <UNK> his acting was so bad he makes a much better replacement for mr bean move over <UNK> <UNK> here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci fi flick perhaps the worse casting in the history of hollywood
<START> a young girl surviving as a prostitute br br a cheap hustler who wants to get the big score br br they meet each other in thailand you may think by the opening titles it's going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life this film feels like an <UNK> sometimes because of its changes of images but still refreshing this story is also about <UNK> and <UNK> it's not an original joke but it is well told says a character and that also applies to this one we've seen the story but this way we see it thailand appears in hot tones the photograph going from one colored to a <UNK> place and it captures the city as the cage of this <UNK> persons there is also a good use of the music to <UNK> the actions
<START> okay look i've seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films you know the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and <UNK> that you just cant wait to see it well i got got again and i'm <UNK> pretty tired of it but i <UNK> it's pretty simple it sucked i know rather juvenile but it did <UNK> so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing why oh why did the lead actress have to be so <UNK> <UNK> so if i may add and the <UNK> she used convey <UNK> pain grief over the death of her daughter did little help i mean jesus oh but the <UNK> on her back demon <UNK> was pretty neat
<START> contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques so read at your own risk br br i loved this film the use of <UNK> in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen for instance in one scene leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen her face is huge in the back and <UNK> is in the <UNK> br br one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the <UNK> on the train a scene shot in an almost political poster style with facial close ups it reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> that intense constant style coupled with the <UNK> of red to convey tons of horror without much gore same with the scene when <UNK> finds her father dead in the <UNK> you can only see the red water on the side it is one of the things i love about von trier his understatement of horror which ends up making it all the more creepy br br the use of text in the film was unique like when <UNK> character is pushed by the word werewolf i have never seen anything like that in a film br br the use of black comedy in this film was well done <UNK> hugo <UNK> is great as <UNK> uncle it brings up the <UNK> i got from his role in the kingdom <UNK> this humor makes the <UNK> of absurd <UNK> <UNK> of train <UNK> against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos easier to take it reminds me of <UNK> in the way the hospital <UNK> is trying to maintain a <UNK> at the end of part one when everything is going crazy it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them yet some people like leo are tuned in but do nothing positive about it br br the voice over done expertly well by max von <UNK> is amusing too it draws you into the story and makes you jump into <UNK> head which at times is a scary place to be br br the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark where <UNK> character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction actually at one time von trier seemed anti woman to me by making breaking the waves and dancer but now i know his male characters don't fare well either i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer when you seriously want the main character to <UNK> their actions but of course they never do
<START> i didn't want this to get complicated <UNK> i have to assume she's gonna read that fear takes flight at 30 000 feet in this taut action thriller an overnight flight to miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when lisa rachel mcadams realizes her <UNK> cillian murphy is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot as the minutes <UNK> by she's in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to late br br one of the many reasons i love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars mcadams and murphy who are also two of my top favorite actors for example the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy two people keep running into each other i got to hand it to the two as well for making a film like this work especially murphy's character jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent yet he's trying to do his job and make lisa feel trapped physically and mentally i mean in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for lisa br br a great thrill ride all the way through a lot of films i would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about but actually i wouldn't mind a prequel to this one which would take place with jackson <UNK> lisa favorite scene is probably that <UNK> scene because it was so unexpected there was also that nice <UNK> to the famous <UNK> scene when is she going to make her move there was also that nice change in <UNK> lisa where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back i also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a <UNK> about the food court how great was murphy with his whole <UNK>
<START> hilariously obvious drama about a bunch of high school i think kids who enjoy non stop hip hop break dancing <UNK> and trying to become a dj at the <UNK> or something to be totally honest i was so bored i forgot even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and as a drama failed <UNK> we're supposed to find this kids likable and nice i found them bland and boring the one that i really hated was <UNK> he does <UNK> on subway trains and this is looked upon as great excuse me he's <UNK> public property that isn't his to begin with also these great kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building uh huh so we're supposed to find a bunch of law <UNK> lovable and fun br br i could forgive all that if the music was good but i can't stand hip hop the songs were at best mediocre and they were <UNK> they're always playing it got to the point that i was fast <UNK> through the many endless music numbers cut out the music and you <UNK> a 30 minute movie maybe there are a few imaginative numbers the subway dance fight a truly funny santa number and the climatic <UNK> show if you love hip hop here's your movie but it you're looking for good drama mixed in forget it also how did this get a pg rating there's an incredible amount of swearing in this
<START> i grew up watching full house as a child i stopped watching it for years but about two weeks ago i started back watching it again now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well my kids can't believe that dj on the show and i are the same age br br i really love the show because it is a show you can watch with your family it has good <UNK> your kids can learn from also there isn't any drugs and violence on it also when the kids on the show have a problem they can always open up to their family for help that's the message kids should be getting from tv now a days turn to your family for help not to drugs kids should be watching more shows like full house instead of half the mess on tv now a days br br i also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth it talks about real life problems and family matters there is always a lesson you can learn from the show br br i vote the show a 10
<START> just like everybody else have said the acting is awful no story or whatsoever poor directing about the <UNK> the <UNK> degree matrix style shooting 1 shoot is stupid enough but for each characters i mean come on <UNK> a break and what's up with all those video game scenes just to remind us it's a video game adaptation jesus they should have fired whoever think up this idea br br 0 <UNK> 10
<START> at the beginning of the film we watch may and <UNK> preparing for their trip to london for a visit to their grown children one can see <UNK> is not in the best of health but he goes along when he dies suddenly <UNK> world begins to spin out of control br br the film directed by roger <UNK> based on a screen play by <UNK> <UNK> is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesn't even know it existed until now br br <UNK> life as a suburban wife was probably boring obviously her sexual life was next to nothing we get to know she's had a short extra marital affair then nothing at all when may loses her husband she can't go back home so instead she stays behind <UNK> her <UNK> at her daughter's home it is in this setting that may begins <UNK> after young and hunky darren her daughter's occasional lover br br darren <UNK> in may a passion she has not ever known may responds by <UNK> herself in front of our eyes may who at the beginning of the film is <UNK> suddenly starts dressing up becoming an interesting and attractive woman she ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her <UNK> with a passion she never felt before br br having known a couple of cases similar to this story it came as no surprise to me to watch <UNK> reaction her own chance of a normal relationship with bruce a widower ends up <UNK> for may who realizes how great her sex is with darren the younger man we figure is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of <UNK> money from may finally the daughter helen discovers what mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made br br the film is a triumph for the director in anne reid mr <UNK> has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of may also amazing is daniel craig he knows how darren will react to the situation anna wilson jones as helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back oliver ford davies plays a small part as bruce the older man in <UNK> class and is quite effective br br the film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind br br
<START> one of the best amitabh comeback movies i liked this was the phase when govinda was going strong with <UNK> the songs were awesome and totally as we call it <UNK> type an <UNK> entertainer with the likes of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for david <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> appearance by mrs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it was a total riot towards the end it was great to see <UNK> perform with such force and humor after a long <UNK> although some may consider it a typical bollywood <UNK> movie i would watch it any day i am giving it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure bollywood
<START> i <UNK> upon this movie because i had a free non new release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly as the store was getting ready to close for the evening the plain white cover and title intrigued me i'm a relatively speaking old lady and my son is a young man of 30 i adore movies that are sheer entertainment such as the sixth sense interview with a vampire harry potter and <UNK> my son on the other hand is a film graduate and enjoys very <UNK> foreign films such as those directed by bergman or <UNK> we generally hate each other's movie choices however we both watched and loved the movie nothing it was unlike any movie we'd ever seen before we're both cynical critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish it is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the u s it would have done very well indeed
<START> i just viewed this great good natured parody of night of the living dead and i have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent this movie <UNK> all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery the <UNK> abandoned house the basement and the front lawn what i especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against c'mon we know that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> locks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the <UNK> bread aside from the cheap acting and voice overs this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of night of the living dead even better than night of the living dead of 1990 br br i think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors <UNK> all the dialogue from the original movie and <UNK> it around bread including how the bread became <UNK> and to avoid <UNK> because they are especially dangerous another great reason why i love this movie is that there is no exception as to what bread is evil <UNK> are evil and even <UNK> are evil which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a <UNK> and a rather <UNK> priest i think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being <UNK> attacked by <UNK> of bread i e the car scene i think the end is very worth sticking around br br even though this is a short and that night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating <UNK> <UNK> living dead part 2 in shocking 2 d is <UNK> another great parody it's still recommend as a great horror parody done by what seems to be college filmmakers i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of night of the living dead and still have respect for the filmmakers i would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves d movies and horror <UNK> it's just a wonderful little short horror film that's fun to watch and learn
<START> i have just recently read the novel mother night i've owned the dvd for some time now and watch it every so often few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has i am amazed at the brilliance not only of <UNK> but of the translation of his text to screen br br do not rent or watch this movie on vhs it must be done on dvd and it must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film to see how they took a fairly simple story yet complex in its substance and dialogue and made it work so well i think any viewer will be amazed br br the <UNK> in the movie are few from the text and do not detract from it much the movie might as well be the book and is the best adaptation i have ever seen i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a <UNK> to merely say go watch it br br it will change you if you do
<START> there may be spoilers br br charlie <UNK> adam sandler who lost his family in a tragedy the terrorist attacks of <UNK> 11 still <UNK> over their deaths he runs into his former college roommate alan johnson don cheadle and the two <UNK> their friendship alan <UNK> to help his old friend come to terms with the terrible loss this is a <UNK> of the basic story of reign over me br br this movie is however a story of how fate <UNK> in our lives when we ourselves may be <UNK> do any thing about our own states of being alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling he feels <UNK> and out of touch with his own reality he is unable to communicate with his wife and his associates at work he can't express his feelings and as a result feels lost and distant from his own world he chances upon charlie on the streets of manhattan while driving from his job eventually he meets and discovers that charlie who originally does not remember alan is living in a false reality of his own charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family he lives as if he were still a student playing in a rock band collecting <UNK> records of the 60s and 70s bands and playing video games he has escaped to a better and <UNK> time in his life where there are no bad guys and he has a lot less to lose everyone in this movie is affected in some way by the tragedy that has affected charlie and his <UNK> to a <UNK> different and better place his <UNK> is his <UNK> and great <UNK> his in laws are <UNK> from his life because they would take him back to the reality that his family is now gone from his life and alan is most affected by him because alan wants to in at first a selfish desire to escape from his own reality to be with charlie as a means to <UNK> himself from his own <UNK> reality and then he wants to find a way to help charlie begin to recover from his self induced guilt and denial of loss it is through this relationship that not only is charlie able to begin to <UNK> himself but that alan in fact learns to communicate and <UNK> his true desires with his associates at work and eventually is able to admit to his wife he has not been able to communicate his real feelings to her but that he strongly wants to because he does love her it is in fact a poignant moment in the film when the stuff has hit the fan and charlie is being confronted with the reality of being put away that he and alan are talking about the situation together over chinese that charlie states that he is in fact worried about alan and not himself br br this movie will if you let it take you through a river of emotions and leave you thinking it will have you laughing at how charlie uses his words like people really do in everyday life to make a comical statement of fact about a real situation it will leave you on the verge of tears in my case actual tears when charlie confronts his grief and begins to come to grips with his tremendous loss and that in fact the tragic reality is his guilt and loss has really never left him and he dealt with it in the only way he knew denial it will make you curse at the cold <UNK> actions of a young <UNK> trying to win his case as i actually did at charlie's hearing and it will make you smile at the <UNK> of a old and wise stern judge donald sutherland who is great at his short distinct role and gives the best performance of a wise stern person in the legal profession since <UNK> <UNK> played an assistant attorney general in absence of <UNK> br br this movie was also amazing to me for a few other reasons 1 i never looked at my watch once during the showing of the film which means it had me from the beginning to the end 2 although the cast was <UNK> this fact was not important to the playing out of the roles of the characters in the film race was a non factor to the performance of the roles in this movie amazing people can actually interact with out this fact being brought out and 3 the only real reference to 9 11 is when charlie's financial attorney refers to the tragedy of charlie's loss as <UNK> charlie had become on 9 12 time will be the true test of how this movie will stand out in the future but if the purpose of a movie is not to just entertain but to make one think and have that movie stay with you long after you leave the theatre then reign over me succeeded <UNK> as far as i am concerned i have not yet forgotten this wonderful thought provoking film and i will wait <UNK> for the day i can purchase it as a dvd
<START> only once in a while do we get an r rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention it's an even <UNK> case when the critics will like it i just came back from the 40 year old virgin and i can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life i went to a 10 35 showing and every row was filled not only that everyone laughed their ass off the whole time through it's two hours of non stop laughing i dare you to see this film and to not laugh br br the plot is simple a man is forty years old and he is a virgin yet behind this simple five second joke we are given a deep complex story that is not only one of the funniest you'll ever witness but has genuine lessons behind it steve carell stars as andy <UNK> the 40 year old virgin we have known steve carell as in my opinion one of the best scene thieves of all time stealing hilarious scenes from bruce almighty and especially anchorman steve carell has come a long way as finally and proudly is given his moment to shine as the star no one will forget his name once they witness this <UNK> funny gut <UNK> roll in the <UNK> hilarious comedy br br the beauty about the film is it isn't 100 stupid the brilliant writing of judd <UNK> and steve carell genuinely has purpose and it's not just one hell of a story to tell behind the <UNK> and vulgar non stop ride of the film comes an important lesson to be learned although not presented in the best way possible the film gives us more than a purely enjoyable time its gut <UNK> attitude will have you laughing the whole time through while we simultaneously see the real life struggles of people like andy and his fellow co workers the end couldn't have been better not only does it deliver what we are promised but it gives one of the most memorable finishing numbers a comedy has ever seen it would have been perfect if there was vince vaughn and owen wilson in there <UNK> somehow but you can't win 'em all now can you br br finally i think as roger ebert put it catherine <UNK> gives an <UNK> perfect performance as <UNK> the one woman andy has his heart truly for not only does she also give us laughs but it is crazy to see how <UNK> she <UNK> the story she was cast <UNK> in the role and her and carell have terrific not to mention hilarious chemistry on screen br br canadian ratings wise once again <UNK> slips away with a <UNK> while british columbia <UNK> and <UNK> all slapped the 40 year old virgin with an <UNK> the same thing happened with four brothers in my opinion the second best film of the year and i can honestly say that i love <UNK> more and more so for that to all you fellow teenagers out there in the states good luck <UNK> in br br overall steve carell gives one of the funniest performances i've ever seen and just about everyone in the cast <UNK> to the non stop laughter everyone will love the 40 year old virgin this summer and i encourage everyone to see it as fast as <UNK> possible it is the best comedy of the year hands down it beats all over the longest yard the wedding <UNK> and of course <UNK> and <UNK> last memorable comedy anchorman br br it is a comic masterpiece and deserves the remarkable amount of praise from the critics who have been loving it every single one of my favourite critics loved it and it deserves a spot on the imdb top 250 right away steve carell is a huge star watch one of the <UNK> ones of the summer right now br br my rating 9 10 br br <UNK>  9 10 br br <UNK>  10 10 br br <UNK> a
<START> this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen the acting was terrible horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone what a waste of time first as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and <UNK> them all into this one movie the prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife its absolutely ridiculous i was not scared at all during the movie which i thought horror movies were supposed to do as for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of scary movie for example at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie
<START> spoilers br br wow end of the world is a <UNK> <UNK> cinematic experience br br here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge <UNK> just happened in china he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages and who's also sending out messages in space he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent they visit it everything looks normal including the priest played by a bored christopher lee but the scientist is <UNK> and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught <UNK> around by the aliens disguised as priests and nuns they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet once the alien get the special element the aliens all <UNK> one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking <UNK> platform lee being the last alien left tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens lee walks in the <UNK> and he's gone the couple looking at the <UNK> that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world decide to follow the aliens because earth is doomed the couple doesn't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the <UNK> and disappear the last shot of the movie is a <UNK> <UNK> planet earth exploding the end br br that's it br br i've never seen such a dull movie in my life it's the most <UNK> movie i've ever experienced the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen they don't care about anything they see the earth disasters on the <UNK> and decide what the heck who needs earth anyway they don't even try to stop them or do something to make things better this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their <UNK> so much so that you can almost feel when they <UNK> their cards when they got off and returned to work i wasn't expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production but i didn't expect it to be this bad br br christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship <UNK> well i'm sorry chris but starship <UNK> was actually goofy fun starship <UNK> is terrible but terribly entertaining end of the world is much much much worst it's beyond dull and <UNK> with no entertainment value whatsoever
<START> this is pretty funny saturday the <UNK> a great work i laughed every minute of the movie this is like scary movie for the 1980's great student bodies <UNK> gags br br too bad this isn't on video but you can still watch it on <UNK>
<START> non existent plot tons of poorly directed super cheesy scenes <UNK> world famous <UNK> who can't even hit their targets a few feet away plus what's up with the ending a bunch of law <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> shooting gallery <UNK> technical mistakes how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a <UNK> 100 these people fire their guns without the need of <UNK> the movie is so bad that even senior hollywood actor like michael <UNK> aliens terminator can't save this junk br br do not watch this movie i realized that i wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one hopefully the director would either stop making movies or learn more for his next movie
<START> this may very well be the worst movie i'll see if i live to be 100 i think a group of first <UNK> could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this i'm dumber for having watched it and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film br br and after i finally turned it off i actually had the urge to vomit br br no one had a clue about photography when made this no one had a clue about acting no one had a clue about just about anything br br i can't believe f x shows this crap on occasion the only time i had seen it was on one of the <UNK> channels not even the main one and it was on at about 3 a m at that
<START> wow is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it trust me watch it br br i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny i cant believe they <UNK> the school sign i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies even the costume was bad it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out just not like this one
<START> i've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt it br br the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg's expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah <UNK> danny glover and margaret <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of <UNK> br br you'll experience every human emotion while watching this film i laughed cried and got angry like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time
<START> although i can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie i still found it to be absolutely amazing it will touch you and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and <UNK> of every movie or you just simply aren't touched by anything it is worth seeing don't come into the movie expecting anything just have a box of <UNK> and an open mind it is beautiful and the acting is brilliant i think will smith despite that he's yet again playing another lonely depressed individual is amazing i believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes you feel something and that's exactly what this movie does give it a chance
<START> i've seen about four other japanese horror films and they weren't too impressive however i could sense that there was a sensible script <UNK> the way br br not here no way this is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening when he finds a suspect to question the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost then the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes up more than half of the movie br br bad enough oh no the film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don't have much to do with the story i've seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective not the case here br br also whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends for example there a few scenes with a slight <UNK> score that builds up and then it just cuts to another scene i'm aware that this can be a dramatic effect that's definitely not the intention here it's just bad editing br br finally there's the ghost who just screams in a way that's not scary or unintentionally funny it's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie br br all of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming then after one of them the movie is over at that point a wave of confusion swept over the audience as i could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time someone did a mock <UNK> and laughter <UNK> it was better than the whole film simply put avoid
<START> the first matrix movie was lush with incredible character development witty dialog and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story these elements coupled by incredible special effects of the day presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time enter matrix <UNK> and its sequel <UNK> the problem here isn't the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue the brothers have taken well developed characters from the first film and <UNK> them out like rotten tree <UNK>  the connection that was first established between viewers and on screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first matrix movie br br to wit <UNK> was developed as a charismatic philosophical character with insight far <UNK> anyone else in the movie but here in <UNK> we're presented by a different <UNK> who stands hard and hollow reduced to corny one liners that <UNK> the character we saw develop in the first film this character just didn't feel the same and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie br br the <UNK> of <UNK> was also a disappointment <UNK> involvement in the first film was minimal at best but he played the role extremely well in <UNK> we discover that tank dies after the events in the first film and he is replaced by a jar jar <UNK> stunt double that couldn't act to save his live think stale box of <UNK> corn <UNK> his performance left me <UNK> throughout and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing there was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions on screen or the delivery in the script was off in either case the experience was humorous at times i felt embarrassed for the actor br br even <UNK> <UNK> persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences the <UNK> battle with the 200 agent smith <UNK> was certainly exaggerated one must wonder for a man so gifted as neo that he would even waste his time engaging in such a <UNK> <UNK> battle when more <UNK> matters attend especially when you consider his ability to fly or his <UNK> ability to bend the matrix certainly neo could have <UNK> the <UNK> much <UNK> and more <UNK> again such acts lend themselves to a script <UNK> by <UNK> and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling <UNK> in <UNK> our expectations of the characters created in the first film are <UNK> promptly sadly for those expecting more of the same you will certainly walk away feeling <UNK> disappointed br br however if you take <UNK> as your standard run of the mill action movie and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the <UNK> of already established character development from the first film you should walk away feeling quite pleased
<START> i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea i think the dark heart character is a little on the rough side and i don't like the way he shape shifts into a mean frog fox <UNK> i was wrong this movie was made for my kid not for me she gets it when it went over under my head of course i don't get it this isn't one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy this is straight for the young ones and the crew knew what they were doing there isn't any political junk <UNK> there's no magic key that will save the world from ourselves nobody has the right to access excess and everyone isn't happy all the time and as a side benefit nobody dies <UNK>
<START> i thought this movie did a down right good job it wasn't as creative or original as the first but who was expecting it to be it was a whole <UNK> fun the more i think about it the more i like it and when it comes out on dvd i'm going to pay the money for it very proudly every last <UNK> sharon stone is great she always is even if her movie is horrible <UNK> but this movie isn't this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime and it will probably become a classic in like 20 <UNK> don't wait for it to be a classic watch it now and enjoy it don't expect a masterpiece or something thats gripping and soul touching just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs br br all in all this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven't seen it see it because what the critics and box office say doesn't always count see it for yourself you never know you might just enjoy it i tip my hat to this movie br br 8 10
<START> a <UNK> wonderful movie brings us to a japan that does not exist anymore despite hollywood's technical expertise i have yet to see a hollywood movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea tom <UNK> the last samurai looked liked the last installment of the lord of the rings in trying to capture rural old japan br br if you like <UNK> but intense story lines this is a must see film it will be a <UNK> from hollow flashy films much like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw i think this is one of <UNK> better stories br br even if it's a movie about <UNK> and <UNK> and the complicated rules that <UNK> life in such settings it did not turn into a skin flick the characters are full of depth and act with much intensity
<START> it was a sunday night and i was waiting for the advertised movie on tv they said it was a comedy the movie started 10 minutes passed after that 30 minutes and i didn't laugh not even once the fact is that the movie ended and i didn't get even on <UNK> to laugh please someone <UNK> me i lost 90 minutes for nothing
<START> this is a really dumb movie it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting but it just isn't br br some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween they come to earth to kill humans but instead of killing they make people their slaves and act goofy the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding <UNK> in space not really what they do these aren't party aliens they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched <UNK> voices the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip off alien who always wears his <UNK> other than the aliens the acting is terrible the writing is obviously meant for children because every character is written like a kid br br this is a dumb movie that only children will appreciate maybe br br my rating 1 2 out of 100 mins pg for mild language
<START> home room like zero day and elephant was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings but unlike the other two films home room focuses on two survivors not the <UNK> or those killed in the aftermath of a shooting making it less <UNK> and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers br br don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected hill street blues episode it is lame but bear with it at least it <UNK> the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes there is nothing here that you can't pick up from the remainder of the film br br like a lot of good little films this was <UNK> a one man show as paul f ryan was both the writer and the director while this <UNK> does not guarantee a good film it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain <UNK> of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features because the script of home room is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and <UNK> that his vision made it onto the screen br br ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which <UNK> the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey the song sarah <UNK> sweet surrender he goes out on and the amazing editing of the final minute br br the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips alicia and erika christensen deanna as the main protagonists although phillips plays her standard <UNK> <UNK> teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone <UNK> if they ever re cut and <UNK> the film this side story should be <UNK> br br a story about two extremely <UNK> girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily <UNK> this film into cliché and predictability but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing <UNK> match slowly <UNK> away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability only to <UNK> back inside themselves <UNK> i'm dying inside line just tears you apart i can't think of a moment in any other film that i felt as intensely as that one she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately <UNK> deanna only makes progress when she <UNK> the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen br br ultimately this not only <UNK> a lot of suspense but leaves you <UNK> both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part since i am a filmmaker i give it a 2 for <UNK> br br the problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most if not all previous successful war stories the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with but did not find that information br br it seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged the actors weren't bad but the plot needs more <UNK>
<START> <UNK> the opening credits sequence is a <UNK> man having a strange all too real nightmare closing in on its <UNK> <UNK> paris the film begins to follow a woman into a <UNK> club where she and a <UNK> bartender <UNK> outside on the deck they toss <UNK> at each other to the effect that she owes him more money although she believes she's paid it all another woman <UNK> the budding violence only to have a bitter fight with the woman herself the initial woman <UNK> out and she is kidnapped christian <UNK> renaissance appears to be another one in an <UNK> line of recent motion capture animated sci fi noir pictures but in spite of whether or not that is essentially true it tells a neatly arranged <UNK> <UNK> detective story that keeps us in the dark in its opening minutes even whilst introducing <UNK> the hard boiled cop we recognize from the beginning as the man awakening from a terrible dream br br the <UNK> of classic film noir are all hit upon without any <UNK> changes for all <UNK> and purposes it is in the <UNK> of its <UNK> that <UNK> french thriller has followed no example for the film's animators <UNK> by the challenges of physical lighting that would normally be faced have been able to begin with a totally black frame and to <UNK> utter pitch white according to the action on screen as they <UNK> imitate the effects of real light sources throughout the frame the distinction of black and white here is full blown without even any of the slightest shades of gray to tone with the characters' less <UNK> definite moral <UNK> and the outcome is a harsh and <UNK> vision of the direction in which commercial civilization is going <UNK> caused to <UNK> the most <UNK> and ruthless of <UNK> it is the artistic study of film noir taken to their visual <UNK> of its philosophy and nothing before has ever shared quite the same execution of this visual concept br br all the characters in this decent <UNK> film seem as if to have been walk off with purely from a gothic comic book in black <UNK> but all together their physical <UNK> their motions and the nuances of their facial expressions look <UNK> within a clear humanity normally films that try out new developments in animation allow their technical advances <UNK> all other <UNK> of production sin city for example left substance and overall good screen adaptation from its source material to be desired br br it may not be mind blowing it may have its narrative conventions and its voice over cast may simply be adequate but renaissance made for 19 million over six years not only feels like actual noir instead of a <UNK> penned <UNK> but also is not secondary to all the visual <UNK> which is played as if to be incidental one leaves thinking not so much about how cool it is when <UNK> is <UNK> bullets shot through a crowded glass <UNK> street but more about its <UNK> of life and death how life's <UNK> such as death make life meaningful
<START> sometimes you have to look back to go forward the 60's did just that we need to remember the past the past is part of the future br br great mix gary j coppola i see a great future you deserve to be nominated and win the 60's best <UNK> of the year br br best mini series of all times br br thanks ursula br br
<START> i personally liked this movie and am <UNK> at the <UNK> some people have given it it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated now if you don't like comic books or animation then of course you won't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me though if you are a fan of interesting strong characters and heroic sexy women kicking butt and saving the world hell you will love this movie i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie quite anime <UNK> or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation like <UNK> a e <UNK> the live action version of <UNK> in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie
<START> great actors an oscar <UNK> actress stunning scenery good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new <UNK> and thats quite big this film was brilliant it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were well side splitting i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much and tears were <UNK> down my <UNK> during the <UNK> ladies in the tea <UNK> scene well done to the british film industry and to craig <UNK> whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year if not of all time
<START> ok so a 10 for a 2 1 2 star movie you ask well see this one and maybe it will make more sense hitchcock never <UNK> scenes together better the film weaves scenes together <UNK> from the start and yet you don't get that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie runs you through the many characters it attempts to develop you sense that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they don't disappoint you when they do screenwriter producer phil <UNK> surreal tale of life <UNK> with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of <UNK> in life than the movie by the same title i will be looking for more good things from this producer in the future
<START> this mini does not get better with age i saw this and it's sequel when originally broadcast and like so many others was blown away in early 2002 i borrowed the novels for both wow and w and r and was even more impressed i then decided that i had to see both again and invested 200 plus on the dvd sets i watched both <UNK> again in painful detail and realized i had done things backwards i should have purchased the novels and borrowed the dvd's br br don't believe it is <UNK> miscast read the novels and see for yourself don't think this is dated screen it for somebody not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get warning reactions from such people range from looks of horror to belly laughs br br according to the trivia section for this mini dan curtis himself chose ali <UNK> and robert mitchum <UNK> production quality music <UNK> dialog a great story was turned into a late 70's soap opera by an overly ambitious producer director who was in way over his head this thing was dated the minute it was completed br br these two <UNK> were great when original broadcast and to those of us who saw them then <UNK> at a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days imo this mini does not nearly live up to its reputation and severely disappoints
<START> the first and only time i saw the woman in black was i think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on tv back in 1989 it was christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church i was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father br br there are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think <UNK> of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every hollywood movie so every <UNK> <UNK> and bang is more <UNK> in your head as there's no distraction another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things <UNK> out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on this is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door br br a superb ghost story i've never seen anything that can match it and with all the <UNK> thats repeated over and over on tv i cant believe the bbc has deleted it after to my knowledge only one showing
<START> i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again on dvd over thirty years later the pictures over the opening credits have never left me it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me and we always discussed the programme afterwards it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our <UNK> public <UNK> br br sir laurence <UNK> voice and delivery is timeless and perfect i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it maybe an similar cold war series could now be <UNK> although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imagine br br buy it
<START> clint eastwood <UNK> his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante sondra locke who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk not that i'm complaining sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment
<START> i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in 9 11 he was a <UNK> at the time and had no idea what was unfolding i liked the way it was told as a documentary if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning 9 11 this would be the one normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known this movie had nobody known also you see a movie concerning 9 11 you hear about a fire fighter or two losing their lives saving people i didn't feel this had any of that i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection very well done indeed my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of 9 11
<START> movies like this one and c r a z y make me very sad for american films with a gay subject matter with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mountain there are few other notable american films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie the bubble this movie centers on two men noam and <UNK> an <UNK> and palestinian respectively their relationship is complicated by the tension between the jews and <UNK> in israel couples in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next or who will say i love you first noam and <UNK> early love is complicated by suicide <UNK> armed security check points and racism while <UNK> friends accept and like <UNK> who is arab it is clear that most of tel <UNK> citizens probably don't br br one of the most touching moments and there are many in this film is when noam and <UNK> attend a production of bent we as movie goers see them watching this play and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes and ultimately this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie br br <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are outstanding as noam and <UNK> director <UNK> fox is brilliant in creating a <UNK> and interesting retelling of the shakespeare classic romeo and juliet and while most movies today have sex in them almost as a sport this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined it is so refreshing also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons there are cartoonish characters in this movie it just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change somewhere on this site i think i read a comparison between this movie and friends well not really yes these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into <UNK> and relationships but i don't recall getting <UNK> up as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in friends br br this is a very good movie it has heart and <UNK> and like all good love stories love does win out but not in it's intact glory of full bloom still it's a very satisfying movie to watch
<START> that's pretty ridiculous i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u s u k and all over the world the religion has over a billion followers i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and <UNK> i have been taught to <UNK> my country and work to contribute to the society i am very dedicated to the <UNK> and <UNK> of my religion have been <UNK> through out life to <UNK> and prepare <UNK> for success through education in order to contribute back to the world i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like <UNK> i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media i wonder why also its sad that these <UNK> are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion its a religion of one billion people and these are less than one percent i am sure the other people of other <UNK> would not like to be represented by the <UNK> ira and many more which are simple small <UNK> <UNK> who use outdated and not literal <UNK> from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge personal or business matters through their so called religion
<START> 'the student of <UNK> is an early feature length horror drama or rather it is an <UNK> i e an author's film this film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend <UNK> to <UNK> or just make a profit by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen fortunately the story of this book with moving pictures is good using alfred de <UNK> poem and a story by edgar allen poe it <UNK> on the <UNK> theme br br unfortunately the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make paul <UNK> appear twice within scenes <UNK> <UNK> was a special effects wizard for his day but he's not very good at <UNK> the camera or moving it film <UNK> leon hunt <UNK> in early cinema space frame narrative however has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to <UNK> the <UNK> theme characters being split by left right near far and frontal <UNK> framing of characters and shots regardless the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position which is <UNK> primitive worse is the lack of editing there's very little scene <UNK> and scenes <UNK> none of this is unusual for <UNK> but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time including the better parts of <UNK> august <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a woman's <UNK> <UNK> bauer <UNK> and the short films of d w griffith br br an expanded universal film <UNK> by <UNK> would allow for a vastly superior remake furthermore the remake has a reason for the <UNK> character other than being an occasional <UNK> and <UNK> surrogate here the <UNK> acted gypsy <UNK> around seemingly with a cloak of <UNK> i know their world is silent to me but i assume with their lips moving and such that their world would not be silent to them so how can <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> shoulders and not be noticed br br nevertheless this is one of the most interesting early films <UNK> <UNK> who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film in addition to playing the lead would later play the title role and co direct 'the <UNK> in <UNK> helping to further <UNK> the supernatural thread in german silent <UNK> br br note the first version i viewed was about an hour long surely not quite complete and was in poor condition with faces <UNK> at times and such i'm not sure who was the <UNK> i've also since seen the <UNK> dvd which at <UNK> minutes is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards but is visually not as bad the repetitive score is best muted though
<START> having previously seen the <UNK> print presented by david shepard i finally got a hold of a complete or <UNK> complete version which was about <UNK> minutes compared to the 30 minute version more widely distributed the shepard print for image entertainment is certainly of superior quality and the best parts are there but it's nonetheless good to see the rest of the film and fill in some loose story ends br br in the shepard print the film ends with mary stating you see i've changed my mind i'm never going home yet in the complete version mary and kenneth <UNK> end their relationship soon after that scene  mary returns home to the country  and <UNK> <UNK> his relationship with vivian this additional footage develops the character vivian who had little relevance in the shepard version moreover in the complete version the film begins in the new jersey countryside with mary where she reads and <UNK> about her ideal lover she's disappointed by the reality of the advances by farm chore boy johnny <UNK> a character completely absent from the shepard version but after her affair with <UNK> she returns to the country to presumably and eventually become a <UNK> wife br br regardless of the print 'a girl's <UNK> is a good little film for <UNK> made by one of the top directors of the <UNK> maurice <UNK> in it <UNK> takes plenty of <UNK> at his own business including by playing a caricature of himself the director of the film within the film the two leads also give quality performances by early screen acting standards robert <UNK> an actor playing a <UNK> chasing star and doris <UNK> as an <UNK> aspiring to play an <UNK> on the screen br br self <UNK> films which made film making the focus of the films were nothing new by now mack <UNK> had already <UNK> this type of film three years prior with <UNK> dramatic <UNK> several aspects of this one stand out though frances <UNK> <UNK> are humorous including <UNK> of the actors on a <UNK> with a hand directing them remarkable for <UNK> i especially liked the film's final title cards where two <UNK> remark on the film's happy ending gee but ain't that <UNK> and the other replies romance <UNK>  that's <UNK> pictures fellow female screenwriter anita <UNK> made a similar self <UNK> conclusion to another film from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> both writers helped change the role of their <UNK> in the business and art br br some of the photography by <UNK> and john van <UNK> <UNK> is good especially concerning the film making business the use of mirrors in several scenes is a nice <UNK> of the film's self <UNK> furthermore the editing is exceptional the quick <UNK> during the studio scenes is especially <UNK> it serves to <UNK> the <UNK> pace filmmakers work at especially back then
<START> there's nothing new here all the standard romantic comedy scenes even down to the taxi <UNK> to the airport to stop the woman flying away the only thing that saves this is the acting of alison eastwood some of the minor characters blink and you'll miss <UNK> <UNK> who obviously had some fun br br turn it off when the pair are in bliss and you won't have to go through the inevitable plot pain
<START> i really have to disagree with guy <UNK> <UNK> who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in <UNK> and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole br br this is not a big budget film rather it is a film that has a strong community feel br br i can't say how much <UNK> films bore me pushing out the same polished stuff again and again <UNK> doesn't seem to be about that at all it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more <UNK> than any recent scottish film br br ok so the acting isn't in the style a blockbuster that's because the actors are seemingly real people i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing and at times unusually beautiful br br <UNK> really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become <UNK> second time around that really do feed into the ending br br overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and non normal structure has turned <UNK> into quite a distinctive and memorable film more of these please
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day she decides to bring him in and fix his cuts she then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work when she gets home however she finds that he is still there he tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin in desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay and as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him not in that perverted way to her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as <UNK> her pet
<START> <UNK> 8 10 it's non <UNK> title and bill paxton directs <UNK> aside this is a pretty good old fashioned rip <UNK> biblical horror thriller in the end it may end up only being the <UNK> southern gothic cousin of kubrick's the shining but hey that's a pretty damn entertaining notion it's also got a <UNK> of a plot twist and a very ambiguous moral message this is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the <UNK> out of themselves watching it too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to star oh well still a devil of a good rent
<START> i loved it fred macmurray is wonderful as <UNK> johnson a somewhat <UNK> proud yet at the same time very vulnerable <UNK> player who is in love with maggie carole lombard who's always there for him they meet in <UNK> after maggie comes off a ship and end up in a bar with anthony quinn tony gets <UNK> in the nose after her insults maggie by thinking her a loose woman all because she took off her hat in public big <UNK> and maggie ends up stuck in <UNK> romance carole and arthur are great together maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her she <UNK> him to go to ny where well watch the movie and find out they have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while he plays the <UNK> i definitely recommend it
<START> this movie was yet another waste of time why oh why do i keep renting crap like this someone please tell me sigh oh well back to the movie at hand cube zero is probably worth it if you really really enjoyed the first movie like i did and just want to check out what's up in the last hopefully movie <UNK> together just to keep some poor actors and screenwriters employed then of course this is the movie for you but if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot evil grin then this movie is definitely for you d ok i'm lying at best this movie sucks ok i have to admit that certain elements to it was cool well <UNK> and i laughed quite a few times <UNK> at the wrong things but nevertheless i was amused but all in all the few things that barely makes the ok category isn't enough to make this movie worth it at all unless you count <UNK> hand of fate one of the top ten movies ever
<START> a damn good movie one that is seriously underrated the songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain but also their hope for the future whoopi goldberg puts in a good performance here but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character i wish she was in more movies br br this movie should have a higher rating i give it a 10 10
<START> i had the <UNK> of attending a special screening of 'the absence of <UNK> at a horror convention in <UNK> br br first off you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a film saying now keep in mind we didn't have much money not that no budget films are bad but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse the results are always poor and there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep fest br br actually <UNK> of <UNK> marks a first in the world of underground cinema it's the only time i've seen a dream cast of talented genre vets actually bore me charismatic actors like david <UNK> tony todd and <UNK> <UNK> randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no names who are their characters what are they talking about who cares it's all so dull you'll <UNK> to care about anything or anyone br br after thirty minutes of this <UNK> test i gave up and walked out of the theater not surprisingly so did most of the cast members in <UNK> br br any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this with a little luck this movie won't ever see the light of day
<START> if you like occasional nudity with junior high school level slap stick comedy then look no further br br starting at about the halfway point the beautiful and erotic <UNK> <UNK> starts <UNK> at every opportunity that is the only thing that made this movie worth watching br br the story is both lame and preposterous the humor is corny and character development is basically non existent
<START> this is the moving tale of <UNK> legendary hero rob roy and his battles with the <UNK> <UNK> like braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical despite their primarily fictional nature i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two the 13 century william wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early 18th century rob roy comes across as an <UNK> but ordinary <UNK> br br the story revolves around a clan <UNK> robert roy <UNK> who lives in a scottish <UNK> <UNK> with his wife mary and their two young sons as the movie begins he and his fellow <UNK> are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local <UNK> cattle rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so <UNK> to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble the marquis of <UNK> in order to buy cattle to herd to market he <UNK> <UNK> this money to his friend alan <UNK> when both <UNK> and the money turn up missing rob roy finds himself in conflict with <UNK> as well as his despicable <UNK> <UNK> cunningham and his sleazy factor <UNK> rob <UNK> honour is also tested when <UNK> seeks to involve him in false <UNK> against his rival the duke of <UNK> whom he wishes to <UNK> of being a <UNK> br br the charismatic liam <UNK> is brilliant as the <UNK> <UNK> rob roy an intelligent <UNK> and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale personally i feel that this is <UNK> best performance his <UNK> albeit irish adding authenticity for the average viewer rob roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted he is a loving husband father and also <UNK> loyal to his friend <UNK> who is accused of robbing him br br tim roth masterfully portrays his major <UNK> and surely one of the most <UNK> and sadistic cinematic villains <UNK> cunningham an <UNK> ruthless <UNK> <UNK> he is very <UNK> for someone who makes it his major business to <UNK> the local women whether willing or otherwise the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity though this hardly <UNK> his horrendous <UNK> of murder rape and <UNK> also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide john hurt plays the arrogant and <UNK> <UNK> who is eventually implied to be <UNK> father br br the movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife i think the phrase used by this pair <UNK> fine you are to me ' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema br br the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as <UNK> wife mary <UNK> lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a <UNK> <UNK> wife and mother the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham while the disgusting <UNK> looks on her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as <UNK> pain and <UNK> but nothing intended to <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shows emotional anguish when he learns of <UNK> rape and further torment when she <UNK> him to <UNK> never to reveal to her husband her <UNK> by cunningham br br of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish <UNK> also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical <UNK> there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale
<START> after being bitten by a bat in a cave a doctor named john <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> transformation into a man bat creature his wife <UNK> him that there's nothing wrong with him it's all just due to <UNK> or the anti <UNK> drugs he's taking the local cop thinks that john is responsible for several gruesome murders the bat people by jerry jameson is one hell of a horrible film the script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity this pointless piece of crap is so mind numbingly boring that you'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it even the design of a man bat creature by a young stan winston is completely pathetic and <UNK> avoid this stinker like the plague 2 out of 10
<START> someone or something thing is leaving <UNK> marks on the <UNK> and <UNK> victims of their blood till dead police detective karl <UNK> melvyn douglas before <UNK> out of the b movie horror genre for greater heights is <UNK> at who or what is behind these notorious crimes the village is overcome by <UNK> and karl depends on his trusted medical genius dr otto von <UNK> lionel <UNK> in yet another effective mad scientist role to provide some <UNK> as to what might be causing the deaths of <UNK> he also fears for the safety of his beloved ruth the lovely fay <UNK> who stars for the third time with <UNK> after doctor x the mystery of the wax museum who is <UNK> assistant br br dwight frye steals the film as a rather loony village idiot who <UNK> bats and carries a demented demeanor wherever he goes it's easy to see why he becomes a suspect as local paranoia is at a fever pitch <UNK> <UNK> provides the film's humor as a very naive and easily influenced patient of von <UNK> who believes she has <UNK> she reads about in books near the laboratory where he works she's <UNK> and often von <UNK> just <UNK> her and constant fictional <UNK> she feels plagued with lionel <UNK> returns as yet another frightened <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> static but rather entertaining nonetheless thanks to the cast the film is obviously as low budget as they come but this doesn't hurt the film too much since it's put together rather well by director frank r <UNK> and his crew i'm certain the film's print has seen better days though this is the kind of b horror item you'd find <UNK> in with 50 other random <UNK> and poverty row <UNK> the film's villain and his motives for feeding a <UNK> made <UNK> creature certainly provides a different take on the frankenstein formula many might be disappointed with the end results as the film <UNK> away from being an actual supernatural tale about a real vampire killer causing the murders
<START> why were there so many people <UNK> into an evening showing of <UNK> <UNK> up against them all <UNK> <UNK> at the san francisco film festival it's about a hit man my friend said well and it's brazilian i added beautiful <UNK> people <UNK> weather lush <UNK> and a hip gangster plot ample <UNK> no doubt br br somebody forgot to tell us one little detail this is a very bad movie really pretty horrible and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made br br so how on earth did <UNK> <UNK> get to make the rounds of berlin melbourne london <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> chicago numerous smaller local festivals and now san francisco apparently because of the way the <UNK> process and the film festival circuit work br br first of all it won first prize at the <UNK> film festival where it was called the best brazilian movie of the year it must have been a bad year they've had much much better ones next snappy <UNK> in <UNK> plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded <UNK> and since the movie isn't featured anywhere and so avoids close <UNK> by critics it keeps going the rounds br br festival <UNK> aimed at promotion sometimes <UNK> it up a lot a chicago festival one called <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> cocktail shot straight out of brazil and referred to <UNK> s boyfriend as the stud of the <UNK> like neighborhood <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> like teen aged daughter of <UNK> sexuality the movie is shot with the urgency of a frequently hand held camera and the director works up a genuine and <UNK> sense of frustration <UNK> from domestic desperation and <UNK> the effect is <UNK> raw and honest and the movie <UNK> toward a conclusion as dead ended as the lives on display not the best writing but it sure <UNK> up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer br br <UNK> <UNK> does concern a hit man two hit men actually and a wife and daughter and a born again christian girlfriend it's shot in <UNK> ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera work mostly in a <UNK> looking poor <UNK> rather than in one of the <UNK> <UNK> or village like brazilian city <UNK> where such wonderful films as black <UNK> <UNK> and city of god were made and not in <UNK> this time but <UNK> <UNK> br br the hit man with family problems is <UNK> <UNK> lopez and his partner with a drug problem is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> both actors have a little tv experience as does the actress who plays <UNK> <UNK> blonde wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who plays his <UNK> ready to revolt daughter <UNK> these actors might make it through the back <UNK> of a few <UNK> who knows in a better directed film

their <UNK> br br a couple of <UNK> one at the berlin festival and one at <UNK> did see this movie's <UNK> but alas they're buried in the web <UNK> henry <UNK> noted from berlin that the film his quotes was the worst of the video works shown the filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film <UNK> wrote and hasn't made any creative use of the new medium nor he adds done anything else creative br br <UNK> pointed out the movie's first big mistake it starts off as a domestic drama that's supposed to <UNK> up when half an hour into the action <UNK> reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie it seems like a perfectly <UNK> decision and is at the very least a waste of time but <UNK> up is all <UNK> ever does like a little kid who's gotten a tool <UNK> for his birthday and goes around <UNK> everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill devastating but true br br writing about the 2004 london festival for <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances easily the film's best feature yes very easily given that everything else is so bad <UNK> admitted that this low budget violent and seedy account of the <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> is devoid of any likable characters and as a result of hope too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition the film is not helped by poor <UNK> <UNK> connecting <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> and mike leigh didn't help matters br br apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing <UNK> the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence which when they come are just <UNK> everything in sight without rhyme reason or skill <UNK> clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be <UNK> right after it followed by an implausible ironic <UNK> scene where one of the characters gets married no doubt the director wanted to exhibit the <UNK> of evil of low level hit men in working class <UNK> but he can't make the characters which he sees <UNK> come alive for us and the structure of the film shows that he also can't edit his material br br seen at the san francisco international film festival on april 28 2005
<START> this is an excellent heartbreaking movie it is by far the best i've seen that depicts the current reality in latin america <UNK> corruption ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims denzel <UNK> gives the most moving performance in his career in my opinion <UNK> fanning is an amazing young actress the relationship between washington and fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed i believed every minute the cast is brilliant christopher walken mickey rourke are great as always walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor i would have loved to see more of both of them the authentic locations are remarkable the camera work is interesting and different there are many famous latin actors in the cast making it all the more interesting for people familiar with latin american cinema i highly recommend this movie
<START> if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some <UNK> and touching of the third kind which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of <UNK> <UNK> but no action a few of the actors i've seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better all the special effects are done by the great <UNK> whom performs all the magic <UNK> his mind a cult movie is written on the box does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all br br get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve <UNK> thanks giving
<START> this movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever the acting was pathetic jordan <UNK> could not show any upset emotions at the beginning of the movie she was supposed to be <UNK> instead she <UNK> her head with her bottom lip stuck out she <UNK> <UNK> without any tears for the crying scene i was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses they had to <UNK> out her everyone else was suffering from over acting as well it was flat out annoying it was also an insult to figure <UNK> jordan took a month to train and they cast her as a person who makes the olympic team it's practically spitting on the effort real figure <UNK> put into their work a pitiful excuse for a movie and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and <UNK> don't waste your life it doesn't even deserve one star
<START> possible spoilers br br when i saw this today i had some expectation of how it would be like not too high but not low either this was nothing like i expected at all though it seems to me like the movie makers couldn't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make br br in the <UNK> of the film it's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting but that'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes very obvious scenes as i watched further i almost fell asleep a couple of times br br the ending is the most ridiculous of all though almost splatter comedy br br i'm not saying it doesn't have some good scenes it's just that the film never becomes whole br br 4 10 movie man
<START> why every horror director wants to imitate the exorcist is a complete <UNK> to me as william <UNK> classic is a very overrated film and in my opinion not all that tense or shocking and yet here's another clean rip off a spanish one this time that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family paul naschy who i must admit looks quite hot here plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister <UNK> behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend at first the priest doesn't believe it but when john's body is discovered with its neck twisted <UNK> demonic behavior becomes more noticeable <UNK> is not only very unoriginal it's also an <UNK> boring film here naschy and director juan <UNK> had an open opportunity to make a <UNK> themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore and yet the result is a tame and overall <UNK> drama that'll nearly put you to sleep the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments albeit very stupid and there's quite a lot of <UNK> filmed female nudity and sleaze the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a <UNK> in money this is just an awful film end of story other european the <UNK> rip offs are the <UNK> and beyond the door and they suck as well
<START> this is one of the best crime drama movies during the late 1990s it was filled with a great cast a powerful storyline and many of the players involved gave great performances pacino was great he should have been nominated for something john cusack was good too as long as the viewer doesn't mind his <UNK> <UNK> accent he may come off as annoying if you can't stand this <UNK> the way that <UNK> character <UNK> with <UNK> character was believable dramatic and slightly comical at times danny aiello was superb as always david <UNK> was great in a supporting role bridget fonda was good but not memorable there were times when this picture mentioned so many characters probably too many it may take a second viewing to remember which <UNK> was which after so many cross references one has to stop and think just to <UNK> the ending didn't have a lot of <UNK> it was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown this was one of the few problems with the film since the movie wasn't billed as a huge blockbuster big screen hit it made some forget that this movie even existed pacino and aiello were great but the film's lack of <UNK> in the theaters may have <UNK> for no nominations it was semi successful in the home market and viewers are still learning that this title is out there made in 1996 it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come br br so make yourself some <UNK> <UNK> you'll see and see this movie
<START> apart from helen bonham carter there is nothing worthy about this movie and the surprise ending the thought of a sequel is even more annoying save your money wait for the video and ignore that too
<START> this is without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen the first time i saw it i was about 9 or 10 years old i began looking sometime before the rape scene and when i saw it i was really shocked thinking what kinda sick movie is this today i've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is it's exciting frightening shocking and in it's own unique way disturbing but the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their <UNK> it'll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their <UNK> about the bodies being found in that river and there is nothing they can do about it it's something they have to live with this ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart brilliant and horrifying br br and the acting is also great especially jon voight and burt reynolds magnificent acting in this movie all in all john <UNK> has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on dick <UNK> novel a must see for all the movie lovers
<START> ok another film bought by me and joe <UNK> ok this isn't the worst film i've reviewed this week but it still sucked <UNK> we had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap br br the monster jigsaw is a <UNK> mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas u just know <UNK> in for trouble when someone <UNK> him with a <UNK> and a <UNK> of shotgun the film wasn't as gory as we hoped i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack again i think the acting sucks sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her <UNK> for what ever reason br br the absolute worst part is the ending it leaves it open for a bit of a jigsaw 2 but thats never <UNK> happen lets face it br br my ratings br br funny 4 100 mock how much fun we had mocking it 73 100 acting 8 100 generally 12 100
<START> this is a really funny film especially the second third and fourth time you watch it it's a pretty short film and i definitely recommend watching it more than once you will <UNK> <UNK> more the second time br br it's like spinal tap but the rap version it has a lot of attitude in it which can be a negative thing in rap influenced films but it's just a total p s take and isn't a problem because of the irony it creates br br plenty of stand out bits one of those types of films which you will find yourself <UNK> lines with your mates and it will raise laughter br br my personal favourite part is the <UNK> in the <UNK> section great video superb
<START> <UNK> has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts one of the movies that the studios <UNK> out <UNK> big budget box office ones it's a mere 70 minutes and doesn't feature many sets and the only star is barbara stanwyck but what a star of course br br stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her <UNK> who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help some psychological battling there br br it's a surprisingly effective little movie its short length makes it taut and that stanwyck is great should go without mention but i'll still praise her every time
<START> well i could <UNK> get into the plot but thats just me maybe <UNK> camera movements at times nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage quality the acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving scantily clad ladies which was nice the climax is confused and disjointed but still <UNK> riveting <UNK> to stella stevens br br the stunts are interesting specially because of the 70's las vegas backdrop there are a few jerky hand held camera movements at the end which keep me guessing for a while but i don't think i ll b chasing the dvd just yet
<START> i realise that the us army was <UNK> by 1971 but this film was unbelievable it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> novel the writer must be a real army <UNK> the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people <UNK> in a prison cell and the useless black top sergeant should have been <UNK> as well these men were going overseas the receiving <UNK> would surely have wondered where all the <UNK> damaged <UNK> were coming from and an investigation would have <UNK> the scene that blew it completely was the <UNK> one farrell the alleged <UNK> room lawyer would have had the <UNK> over a barrel for <UNK> an illegal order to torture <UNK> in <UNK> to the <UNK> convention actual assault on an <UNK> man sexual assault and conduct <UNK> an officer <UNK> he just walks away after this discipline <UNK> down into a <UNK> level and the film becomes unwatchable i don't know how it ended i went to bed
<START> most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable however because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films a perfect example was the john garfield film air force in which a b 17 nearly single <UNK> takes out half the japanese air force however pride of the marines is a welcome departure <UNK> high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner when i first saw this film i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true however after <UNK> further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the <UNK> of honor this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true
<START> maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best jackie chan's movies but i think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made there also was some memorable stunts which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic this movie influenced many other action movies and i think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film like they could remake that chase scene i thing with modern <UNK> they could make it even better there also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when jackie wasn't fighting <UNK> i think they could put more fighting scenes in this film
<START> it really doesn't matter that superman comic books are unbelievably naive and their target is ten year old what matters is that superman returns is bad movie br br in the beginning a question for you dear readers how many of you actually believe that superman will be defeated by bald kevin spacey anyone just as i thought no spoilers here so let's get to some major issues right now br br firstly this movie looks like commercial scene in the bar with superman clark kent drinking <UNK> is only scene which looks as it supposed to imagine commercial of superman two and half hour long let's be serious this isn't <UNK> or the <UNK> you actually feel that this movie is way too long and special effects are not so special by the way br br secondly scenario is silly sometimes even if something is acceptable in comic in cinema it looks just stupid and it's like that in this case of course dialogs are disgrace i can't believe somebody took money to write them how many times we will be fed with villain making speeches how many times laws of physics will be raped jesus it's not only the matter of <UNK> strength but also a resistance of <UNK> his dealing with how many times lois lane will be fooled by kent how many times hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books since there's hard to make a good story why having a weak story for a <UNK> it just doesn't work guys get a grip try harder please or just stay on this strike forever who cares i got the feeling that <UNK> is <UNK> on strike no offense i'm not questioning the lame money those people are paid but the quality of the product they deliver in this case there is no quality at all at this point you may ask yourself is it that bad yes it is br br <UNK> acting is weak which is quite a surprise since bryan singer usual suspects is directing kevin spacey is having fun but he's the only one audience is rather not in the mood for jokes thing is that comic book hero can be developed into real personality with clear motivations but also with doubts fears some depth in this case nobody did that job and characters aren't really interesting br br finally whole effort of creators turns this movie into parody second unit is so bad that <UNK> attention since there's nothing interesting going on on screen anyway the harder they try if they try the funnier it gets but it isn't laugh you could expect br br final conclusion one word shame br br this particular movie ladies and <UNK> is camp don't waste your time and don't waste your money too stay home read a book
<START> this was the best bonnie and clyde movie i have seen it has more accurate accounts of what happened and while it <UNK> <UNK> their crimes it casts the pair in a normal light i give this movie a 10 it has great actors realistic scenes and excellent writers
<START> bill <UNK> <UNK> is not an attack on organized religion it's an attack on christianity and islam apart from <UNK> a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> machines to get around <UNK> <UNK> he really doesn't attack <UNK> and seems <UNK> when a <UNK> actually challenges the existence of the state of israel if bill <UNK> followed his <UNK> to its logical conclusion he would realize that the very creation of israel in the palestinian <UNK> is based on the so called <UNK> <UNK> of organized religion this is evidence of his complete and utter lack of <UNK> or focus in the creation of this film br br i find it really hard to believe that the man is <UNK> or even all that intelligent anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid what makes him the rational person in the room in a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people br br if you want to watch a good movie documentary about the actual <UNK> of religion and how religion can actually be <UNK> to the human civilization watch richard <UNK> <UNK> of all evil ' it is a brilliantly <UNK> documentary clearly <UNK> what it hopes to achieve and how br br bill <UNK> <UNK> is not funny poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic it seems to be the <UNK> and <UNK> of an old man disgruntled with his catholic upbringing i almost feel sorry for him
<START> i found this a good movie to pass your time but not by any chance of any historical value the portrayal of <UNK> reminded me a cheap soap opera br br the twist of the facts is funny she gave birth while feeding her people o please a pregnant queen of egypt especially this one would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason they tried to make her appear a saint for god's sake and the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister beyond description br br <UNK> was the greatest politician of her time her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals she did everything for only two reasons power and self <UNK> she was <UNK> in a family where she had to <UNK> for survival something she did very well anything that stood on her way was either murdered her brothers and sister or <UNK> <UNK> and mark anthony br br unfortunately <UNK> was too powerful to kill and too gay to be <UNK> so he was her end
<START> i generally love these 1930 mystery police charlie chan type of movies and this is no exception however something seems bad with this movie a late attempt to switch from cerebral <UNK> movies centered around the plot <UNK> to a <UNK> bar <UNK> by comedy relief that is as <UNK> as sore feet a <UNK> <UNK> appears from nowhere <UNK> a clumsy <UNK> who plays the detective and even other characters seem <UNK> into providing comedy relief the plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today but back then the possibility of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was not only real but a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean haven't we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i've seen only godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that <UNK> in being the worst i've seen in the cinema with this one br br there is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you don't even now who has been killed and who has not and you don't care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie br br stay as far away from this movie as possible 2 10
<START> this movie shows us nothing original every idea or action scene can be found in many previously released movies fabulous nick is completely plain here even will <UNK> is calm and evil nor good mr duvall is ok but has a very small part so does angelina so how can we determine her newly acclaimed stardom overall there are too many characters so that nobody and nothing is especially detailed this makes the movie easy to forget too bad don't you think
<START> this movie rocks <UNK> sexy as ever and polly wow were we really ever that young this movie can still touch the hearts of a lot of teens it needs to be put on dvd soon or it will become a classic i really enjoyed growing up to this movie i have always had a crush on <UNK> now i am too old but to this movie is made for all <UNK> you know i come from the early 80 s area were i had to watch everyone <UNK> live the life i wanted but thru movies i can do that all over again i guess in short i am hoping and wishing that this movie not be lost in time but <UNK> to the youth so they may enjoy the heart warm filling you get learning about <UNK> and <UNK> problems and how to get away with stuff that seems so major back then but don't mean <UNK> now so this movie is a dating tool
<START> i recently viewed <UNK> landscapes at the seattle international film festival i was drawn to the movie as a photographer because i'm both familiar and a fan of <UNK> work while i believe the movie does a good job getting it's message across i couldn't help but feel that it was made as a complete <UNK> to the photographs and subsequent popular book by <UNK> obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring <UNK> and pans across them while this is a good effect when used <UNK> i felt like 75 of the movie was just stills from <UNK> book which i already own that's probably an exaggeration but that's how i felt if you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one
<START> at first glance this documentary fiction cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking of course when something <UNK> thought it can then be <UNK> the reality is this movie combines <UNK> with innuendo and <UNK> conclusions the link that what the <UNK> would have you see between science and <UNK> is in fact not <UNK> in science at all the <UNK> <UNK> study mentioned in the film claims that <UNK> by a group can <UNK> crime in a given area washington d c in this case in reality the <UNK> <UNK> rapes and <UNK> crime rate was about 30 higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between <UNK> there was absolutely no <UNK> in the homicide rate during the study in fact each and every claim that <UNK> <UNK> to science can and has been <UNK> br br my conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to <UNK> people or a joke either way i suggest that you do not waste your time br br if you are looking for a long <UNK> movie about science that could <UNK> thoughts you might consider <UNK> 1990
<START> i went to this movie at a cast and crew show cause my friend whom is a producer on the movie invited me forget what you have seen in the commercials forget what you have heard go see this film for yourself i was more than surprised by it in a world of the grinch <UNK> angels the <UNK> day <UNK> here comes a film that is worth your hard earned bucks glorious scenes wonderful <UNK> and a cast you want to eat with your heart i found this to be one of this years most <UNK> <UNK> films and with reason robert deniro deserves an oscar nod if you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package this would be the film
<START> to be honest i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it that's how i watch movies whenever possible no <UNK> i thought this was going to be a movie about <UNK> in the woods or something i was wrong kinda br br loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to do br br another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to <UNK> these kinds of things do happen i'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are implausible really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices sometimes things turn out good sometimes they turn out bad and such is life br br i highly recommend this movie
<START> well if you like pop punk punk <UNK> and a tad bit of modern psycho billy then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching this movie has tons and tons of band cameos along with president of troma lloyd kaufman as a semi major role and lots of goofy death scenes sounds like it may be good right well the deaths keep coming and repeatedly to many different bands of the <UNK> tour and the fans at the event some of the deaths start of stylish but then they are recycled over and over to the point of being completely repetitive almost everyone dies of having their head <UNK> or intestines being pulled from their stomach the gore looks as if it was from <UNK> <UNK> zombie 90 extreme <UNK> with this being the watered down type blood but now that movie is actually decent and provides humor something that this movie terribly lacks sure the movie is made by doug <UNK> from troma it's got great low budget potential and it tries but just too hard everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie and thats what brings it down everything tries to be too comic and goofy by using intentional bad acting an <UNK> of pointless deaths and doing the same thing over and over it's basically <UNK> zombie ass <UNK> <UNK> of the board or any movie you have made with your friends it's funny to those who made it and that's about it br br great potential great idea great use of effects but it's the same thing over and over a band plays a band dies fans die everyone dies blood is <UNK> everywhere the process is repeated br br the question is for these types of movies which is basically <UNK> slap <UNK> do they try too hard or not at all
<START> horrendous avoid like the plague i would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever special effects acting mood sound etc appear to be done by day care students wait i have seen programs better than this opens like a soft porn show with a <UNK> nude female doing a shower scene then goes bad from there good nude scenes but that is it sound and light problems were <UNK> throughout the movie at times i would swear i could hear the roaring of the camera <UNK> <UNK> i would like to see another movie on this story but done by different people this <UNK> of actors and crew need more acting and movie making lessons voted 1 out of 10
<START> ridiculous this movie is actually a vehicle for the <UNK> school of enlightenment if you are wondering who the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> is a 35 000 year old spirit warrior who appeared in j z <UNK> kitchen in <UNK> washington in 1977 knight claims that she is <UNK> channel she also owns the <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> sessions in which she pretends to go into a <UNK> and speaks hollywood's version of <UNK> english in a <UNK> <UNK> voice she has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as <UNK> at <UNK> 1 000 a crack and at her <UNK> school of enlightenment and from the sales of tapes books and <UNK> clark and <UNK> 1993 she must have hypnotic powers searching for self <UNK> otherwise normal people <UNK> her command to spend hours <UNK> in a cold <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> one of america's finest <UNK> <UNK> would roll his eyes about this movie he has in the recent past criticized <UNK> for their <UNK> and <UNK> of quantum theory this movie does the same thing as those fools br br there is a great review of this movie at <UNK> i recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> br br http <UNK> <UNK> com <UNK> 2005 <UNK> what the <UNK> <UNK> i noticed one reviewer here at imdb say to take this movie with a grain of salt it will take enough salt to kill a horse to <UNK> through the garbage thinking of this movie
<START> i actually liked this movie until the end sure it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the <UNK> classical <UNK> where she has <UNK> to catch up to the other <UNK> trained students what does the main character do wow them with her grasp and execution of this time <UNK> musical tradition no she <UNK> and <UNK> the great <UNK> <UNK> from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable <UNK> spears wannabe pop song my ears <UNK> and in the supreme moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing <UNK> any teacher not in a spears induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot save your time save your ears skip this movie
<START> when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the <UNK> 2008 but when i saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot br br the only thing that really let me down are the performances emily blunt the devil wears <UNK> is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul <UNK> is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him jim <UNK> and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable br br to me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script i don't know but that's how i feel about the movie br br but overall it's a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt
<START> this is a great movie i love the series on tv and so i loved the movie one of the best things in the movie is that <UNK> finally admits her deepest darkest secret to arnold that was great i loved it it was pretty funny too it's a great movie <UNK>
<START> this movie was very enjoyable though you'll only like it if you hate going to the dentist but aren't afraid of a movie where one of them goes <UNK> you love horror movies br br i particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the <UNK> actions of the main character the fact that he's totally obsessed by <UNK> especially in the mouth and then catches his wives providing some <UNK> pleasure to the mud covered pool man is a pretty believable reason to go overboard br br liked it i give it an 8
<START> well this film is a difficult one really to be straight with you this film doesn't contain much of a riveting story <UNK> does it make u <UNK> to know how it'll end but i'll tell you something now never have i been as tense and jumped up before in my life this film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills to be fair i did watch it at almost midnight so i was kinda sleepy anyway so maybe that explains why i was <UNK> or maybe it's because this film does deliver in that aspect it's basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event they decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first <UNK> i think it's it's the sister of the main character and she brings along her husband during the night the husband hears noises <UNK> it out and thats when things start to go really really wrong they don't stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave <UNK> as something isn't right to cut a long story short eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of br br it's not a hollywood blockbuster <UNK> does it have a huge budget but please don't let that put you off it's creepy tense and very very <UNK> just give it a try
<START> if you are used to seeing gabriel <UNK> in serious roles such as tom in <UNK> crossing or keaton in the usual suspects i recommend you take a look at this film even if you are not a fan of gabriel <UNK> in particular all the actors in this film give really great performances if you've got about eleven bucks that is close to nine <UNK> i say order it online or rent it from you favorite movie rental place guaranteed to make you laugh whether or not you normally like gangster type movies mad dog time trigger happy is one of those movies you never forget and find yourself watching over and over you will talk about it so much your friends will be begging to borrow it
<START> based on the novel by michael <UNK> the mysteries of <UNK> is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer <UNK> around with two friends the year is 1983 and young art <UNK> jon foster is at a <UNK> completely opposed to his father's lifestyle art plans to become a <UNK> visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography the whole film feels like the director whose previous effort <UNK> was funny if outright commercial is desperately seeking indie credibility by <UNK> together aspects of other indie films but <UNK> it with stars like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> miller and nick nolte like so many of the star laden <UNK> at sundance this year it felt like this was a <UNK> studio <UNK> vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points it failed in that respect and as a film in its own right
<START> so it has come to this fast expensive cars that only the upper 1 will ever drive the girls that pose next to them in <UNK> magazines second <UNK> and no name actors cheap <UNK> appearances by people from <UNK> culture br br this is the garbage that hollywood has to offer don't get me wrong i love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy but please will the collective <UNK> that <UNK> this stuff please stop count to ten breathe have a <UNK> <UNK> then <UNK> <UNK> years and recall what made movies enjoyable once upon a time then actually make some movies like that again br br i have nothing against poker but the entire pop culture explosion it has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous everyone and their mother thinks their maverick now not that half of them even will get that reference some executive said hey what <UNK> do you want to <UNK> 9 50 out of i know sir the 18 35 market ok let's give them poker girls and fast cars brilliant idea sir the result a film that i've seen a hundred times late at night on spike tv and more often than not starring dolph lundgren br br now don't <UNK> me i am not a film <UNK> over the top artsy flicks like the english patient don't <UNK> my boat but generic films that should not have even been made straight to dvd bother the hell out of me too only adolescent <UNK> will have their <UNK> <UNK> by this and i imagine the ones in the higher end of their iq range will see this for what it is a <UNK>
<START> this movie describes the life of somebody who grew up in the worst of circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a respectable person whats more is that this is a true story br br antwone fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused such just because he was not white antwone fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and he never fooled around with women coke <UNK> <UNK> alcohol or any of those things that are very popular in the places he was growing up br br there is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent the only rating i can give it is a 10 10
<START> watching john cassavetes film opening night i was reminded of something that quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting he referred to an example of say if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it wouldn't be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without a doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy otherwise as he said what am i doing i couldn't help but think of his words when watching gena <UNK> character myrtle gordon who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario there is more to this in <UNK> film of course since it's about how the theater works around a star actress what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character and how one lives when all one has like myrtle gordon is the theater br br near the beginning of the film after <UNK> a performance myrtle is <UNK> <UNK> and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and <UNK> her heart out to myrtle it's a touching little moment but it doesn't last as she has to get in the car <UNK> rain and all she then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident she's not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit from then on she's sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it's out of her system at first this shows in small ways like when she <UNK> a scene with her fellow actor played by cassavetes and can't seem to stand being hit she blames it on the lack of depth in the character the writer what do you think the play lacks hope says myrtle but then nancy starts to show up to her an <UNK> that to myrtle is all to real until she's suddenly gone br br cassavetes as in the past films is after a search for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the lack thereof and how it affects others around the person this isn't exactly new ground for rowlands who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence in that case because of alcohol nor would it be alien territory for <UNK> ben <UNK> who just came off starring in killing of a chinese <UNK> but the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene cassavetes doesn't tell them how to get from a to b in a scene and he doesn't need to there's a mood in a cassavetes film that <UNK> the sometimes <UNK> camera work you know myrtle for example should be content somehow even if it isn't with the plot but she's haunted and is <UNK> with her character's lack of depth and the tone of the play aging who goes to see that she asks the playwright and it starts to affect those around her too br br the question soon becomes though not what is the usual a conventional <UNK> would make the conflict <UNK> she be able to go on stage will the show go on ' this isn't important for cassavetes even if it's there as is the question <UNK> she be alright ' perhaps going through such a <UNK> play as the second woman could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality seeing sara and attacking her in front of total strangers who wonder what the hell is going on or will the <UNK> lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her the depths rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing and that it's expected doesn't mean it's any <UNK> than woman under the influence if anything it's just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession and consequently the other performances are just as true from <UNK> to nancy played by a subtle laura johnson cassavetes answers to his own <UNK> questions aren't easy br br one of the real thrills of opening night along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script is to see cassavetes take on the theater the way he does we see the play performed and it's apparently a real play and we only know slightly what it's about when we see the actors on the stage performing it we wax and <UNK> between being involved in what melodrama is going on relationship <UNK> and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence and the <UNK> of the actors i wondered watching how much really was improvised how much cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where myrtle starts to go <UNK> or in the climax is completely <UNK> he's on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen br br it's funny startling chilling and edge of your seat stuff some of the best theater on film scenes ever put in a movie and we see the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor <UNK> together wonderfully opening night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness reality and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does <UNK> mean
<START> this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen spoilers ahead first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the <UNK> the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of <UNK> most movies aren't a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny except jack nicholson who is a good actor the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs i'm surprised it's gotten such a high rating on imdb
<START> this movie is just so good despite carmen <UNK> this has to be one of the better films i have seen in awhile jamie kennedy is just amazing and loren dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well the plot is great as well it's all very real which is scary it says here that it's a drama but this is one of the damn funniest dramas i have ever seen go check it out
<START> if the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music they succeeded with me <UNK> human situations became original personal and immediate so that i personally felt touched by each situation i believe i would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie without spoiling i can say that i was very moved by the movie's approach to living haven't actually cried out of what joy empathy just deep emotion in a very long time i would love to find a way to show it to others saw it at seattle international film festival
<START> secret sunshine marks the return of director lee <UNK> to the film making world after a multi year absence having three <UNK> acclaimed films already under his belt he <UNK> now veteran <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her considerable cannes winning talents for the primary role of lee <UNK> what follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her <UNK> <UNK> br br one of the things that becomes apparent while watching secret sunshine is that it doesn't really care to follow any specific genre but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey the story itself follows lee <UNK> as she moves with her son to the city of <UNK> whose <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to secret sunshine she moves to <UNK> in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown so the film is born from tragedy and you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice guy mechanic <UNK> played by song <UNK> but this isn't a romantic comedy br br as we and <UNK> <UNK> follow <UNK> as she encounters <UNK> and the fate that it has in store for her the cracks in her armor quickly become apparent she is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough secret sunshine still manages to follow a mostly <UNK> dramatic arc but pulls back on the <UNK> which might <UNK> some viewers especially the ending but the <UNK> symbolism present in the name of <UNK> the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied once i started to think over the film some more br br ms <UNK> is rather impressive throughout especially considering that if the role were any less well played it would've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama but she captures the nuances of <UNK> attempts to deal with her <UNK> with a <UNK> of subtlety mr song has a much smaller role in this film than other films but he performs adequately appropriately giving stage to ms <UNK> technically the film is well done in a classical sense no flashy <UNK> are employed here the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself i think my only real complaint and one that might not be able to be fixed is that despite all the time we spend with <UNK> there is a bit of distance between <UNK> and the audience or at least me i think some of this <UNK> from the nature of the work because if total empathy were pushed then we wouldn't be able to see the problems that <UNK> has <UNK> on the other hand i never felt moved along with <UNK> plight despite her many tears and increasingly <UNK> behavior br br all the same the film still stands quite impressive especially in that it <UNK> me to think about it the further meanings present in it and its <UNK> on tragedy <UNK> self deception isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running <UNK> by a strong lead performance i honestly didn't notice its 2 25 hour runtime and that says something well done 8 10
<START> i am amazed with some of the reviews of this film the only place that seems to tell the truth is <UNK> com this film is awful the plot is extremely lazy it is not scary either people out there who think that because it stars sarah michelle <UNK> it is somehow like the grudge should forget about it this film is more like dark water except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it i was extremely disappointed with this film it didn't scare me nor interest me either let's face it this type of plot has been <UNK> to death at this stage e g the dead trying to contact the living <UNK> what lies beneath ghost story dark water darkness the <UNK> etc etc it seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the japanese and the <UNK> the films that are coming out of hollywood like this are cynical <UNK> in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer they're just being <UNK> out
<START> this was the first <UNK> episode of the columbo series although it was filmed after death lends a hand and it <UNK> one of the most successful tv series in history br br jack cassidy who played the murderer in the series three times <UNK> <UNK> arrogance and self <UNK> in equal measure here as ken franklin one half of a mystery writing team who <UNK> an elaborate plot to kill off his partner jim <UNK> played by martin <UNK> who decides to <UNK> their professional relationship leaving franklin exposed as merely a good <UNK> rather than a prolific writer br br the initial murder set up is fantastic and <UNK> performance <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> that he was the best columbo murderer in the series br br peter falk is wonderfully understated in his role as columbo and the character's inherent traits and <UNK> which are <UNK> by a seeming <UNK> and absent <UNK> contrast particularly well with <UNK> character's extreme <UNK> one of their early scenes together where ken franklin <UNK> a motive for the killing through jim <UNK> non existent <UNK> see of <UNK> hit men operating in the underworld <UNK> this very well franklin hints to columbo this potential motive and columbo <UNK> or <UNK> fails to <UNK> on forcing franklin to express his disappointment in a <UNK> <UNK> manner and compare him <UNK> with the detective in the books mrs <UNK> br br also noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of 24 year old steven spielberg notwithstanding some <UNK> <UNK> of cameras <UNK> the actors and actresses he adds some stylish and elaborate touches to <UNK> the general <UNK> of the episode one particularly stark image is of jim <UNK> dead body lying on the <UNK> almost dark in the <UNK> as ken franklin raises a glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to <UNK> <UNK> wife i have no doubt that working to a <UNK> 10 14 day schedule <UNK> efforts should not be <UNK> br br unfortunately the event of the second murder <UNK> by a <UNK> scheme which is plotted by a female friend of <UNK> and ironically referred to as sloppy by columbo in his climatic <UNK> up takes the steam out of the whole thing the cutting edge of the plot is <UNK> and the screen time between falk and cassidy <UNK> <UNK> at this point to perhaps help the script writer stephen <UNK> out of a tight corner since he cannot <UNK> develop the story without another murder br br the climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode the initial banter and exchange of words between falk and cassidy is strongly and effectively executed but it merely <UNK> the fact that it should have happened more in the episode the main <UNK> lies with the <UNK> clue if it can be called a clue <UNK> character's <UNK> <UNK> and arrogance is amazingly <UNK> by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt and once this is mentioned he <UNK> in a rather <UNK> and <UNK> fashion br br all in all a bold opening to the series which inevitably <UNK> and <UNK> all that is good about columbo and <UNK> the problems associated with such <UNK> i e maintaining the high standards and particularly creating a credible and suitably intelligent ending
<START> i saw this movie with my friend and we <UNK> stop laughing i mean there was nothing scary about this movie it was funny all the lines freddy said were hilarious i think they <UNK> have even made a new nightmare and just gone to freddy vs jason although some parts were gross like the head blowing up and any elm street film from 1 5 sucked this was the best besides number 1 i <UNK> <UNK> this movie if you want a good horror but if you have nothing else to do rent this and you'll laugh alot i want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think it would be scary freddy's dead the final nightmare overall grade b
<START> i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of mine br br for the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood hating this film hating myself and even hating the french actress and then br br i don't know what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way that i hadn't been in years and this was despite the fact that one of the <UNK> broke and they had to do each <UNK> by hand i was in the theater for close to four hours but it was worth it br br i believe that great movies pull you inside a world make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink this film did that it was one of the best <UNK> experiences i have ever had br br br br
<START> i was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people maggie smith a very young bob <UNK> and of course peter ustinov my disappointment was thus <UNK> to discover the film doesn't work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large american corporation based in london <UNK> his way past <UNK> <UNK> karl malden and tech geek <UNK> ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the <UNK> <UNK> part of the film to do this he needs to get passed a <UNK> proof security system that guards the corporation <UNK> and here is problem one his perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably <UNK> and stupid his lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras the second problem is the heist fraud really happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension maggie smith is sadly miscast as <UNK> <UNK> next door neighbor secretary who just can't keep a job i love maggie smith but she just seems too together here too composed the part called for more of a wacky physical comedian furthermore ustinov and smith have no chemistry together maybe it's the age difference but the later romantic relationship as devoid of actual romance as it is still comes off a little creepy ustinov co wrote the script and it was thought well of at the time but i found it unfunny meandering and a sad waste of a great cast
<START> i have given this show i have only watched seven episodes four stars because most of her jokes set ups appear to fail some are not funny outright but some are amusing in a 12 year old boy kind of way she reminds me of that new york painter who throws paint upon a <UNK> calls it art and sells it for a lot of money silverman throws out what she's got including the kitchen sink while she <UNK> that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different br br however what she's got often times is not enough as though she lacks the kind of follow through a good comedian needs to succeed br br the whole enterprise is like an under done <UNK>
<START> this is a well directed film from john <UNK> who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the <UNK> version of 'the <UNK> of <UNK> set in a london that only hollywood could manage atmospheric but nothing like the real thing it is a story of obsession and <UNK> love from the novel by <UNK> <UNK> br br i was looking forward to seeing it on dvd as i had never seen it before and being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones so i bought it well she looked fine but i'm sorry to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh bette davis was one of the greatest film actors make no mistake but here she did make one it was impossible to take her character seriously it wasn't as gruesome as the dick van dyke <UNK> <UNK> cockney accent but close br br in the other major role was leslie howard and he did it superbly he was a subtle and intelligent actor the supporting actors <UNK> themselves well worth watching despite ms <UNK> vocal <UNK>
<START> profanity stupidity self <UNK> and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie making <UNK> attempt to prove my cousin <UNK> was no <UNK> shows the opposite instead he is generally too lightweight and <UNK> to handle the lead a true must miss
<START> i don't know why i keep doing this to myself i keep on defending the dutch and <UNK> cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances and then they <UNK> you around the head with junk like this <UNK> care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the dutch speaking countries it's a dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise clearly based on <UNK> american slasher classics such as friday the 13th and halloween the producers and writers aimed really high with this but fell really low <UNK> care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here it's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions like the night of <UNK> for exactly 5 minutes <UNK> care tries to tell a story and even to create a <UNK> then it changes into a lame and low brain slash <UNK> stalk movie with gruesome yet very hilarious and cheap make up effects the acting of the entire cast is <UNK> even though there are a few respected names involved the leading male role is played by <UNK> <UNK> this guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in <UNK> he's a beloved singer host of tv shows and idol of many young girls he never ever mentions this thing he starred in though like everybody else in the <UNK> he's trying to convince himself <UNK> care never happened
<START> watching speak easily is painful for fans of buster keaton seeing such a phenomenal writer actor comic director and stunt man subjected to this <UNK> spectacle is like seeing a <UNK> used as a drop cloth or perhaps more like seeing the finest <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> br br keaton is ill cast as professor post whose overblown <UNK> is the only thing keeping him from saying tell me about the <UNK> george post would have said something like kindly inform me as to the status of the small <UNK> in the family <UNK> of the order <UNK> kind sir who i believe is primarily addressed with the <UNK> <UNK> when keaton created his own characters they might be <UNK> clueless but they weren't stupid they were quick studies and became masters of their worlds not so with post who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a <UNK> rat had of the titanic and while keaton's original characters had a charming <UNK> and innocence post comes across as such a profound sexual <UNK> that if he ever did become physically <UNK> he'd put an ice bag on the <UNK> and seek medical help br br there are a couple of small redeeming moments such as keaton's attempts to get rid of the <UNK> <UNK> todd or his suggestion as to appropriate <UNK> for a greek dance but it's just not worth enduring the entire film to see them br br if you're a fan of bad movies get drunk and watch speak easily with friends a la mystery science theater 3000 but other than that stick with the <UNK> let them be 100 of what buster keaton is remembered for
<START> cheap amateurish unimaginative exploitative but don't think it'll have redeeming amusement value about as <UNK> <UNK> and just plain dull as a film can be
<START> exactly what you would expect from a b movie <UNK> gratuitous nudity boring in parts ridiculous gore and cheesy special effects of course it could have been better better acted <UNK> better written directed etc but then i guess it wouldn't have been a b movie the actors pretty much sucked in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire <UNK> or something except with a lot of blood profanity and nudity br br <UNK> <UNK> must be <UNK> out she absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium not that acting really matters in these movies but she was better than any of the other actors she's also <UNK> hot in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie wow her <UNK> is absolutely stunning in that outfit i mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out and near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely <UNK> br br so if your a <UNK> b movie horror buff like myself check this out if not you should probably avoid at all costs
<START> having only seen two of his pictures previously i've come to terms with altman before though i always labeled his style of film making boring you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius br br health is fairly underrated and very <UNK> out of print in fact i don't think it's ever even been <UNK> to vhs why is that when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily this one is left behind for no good reason honestly i had no real problems with this film it was for the most part consistently amusing and funny almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances there is real skill here br br and paul <UNK> <UNK> on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating br br if you can try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem it's not perfect but it's much better than most of the <UNK> out there getting dvd releases hell i'd be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thing br br it's often on the fox movie channel though so look out for it
<START> this is the biggest piece of <UNK> i've ever watched it is excruciatingly boring i would have rather sat through a <UNK> on <UNK> than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this of anything lower than a 1 br br the reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is unintentionally funny are absurd and just plain wrong not one thing is funny about this movie they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so uninteresting honestly though i didn't watch it to the ending but that should say something about how horrible it is worst movie ever br br immediately after <UNK> this filth from my dvd player i started <UNK> it against the <UNK> in front of my house not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie then <UNK> <UNK> his pants <UNK> for your time
<START> i have watched this movie on dvd a couple of times now the first time i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour an engrossing entertaining film thank god no <UNK> knightley in it refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of queen victoria and the difficult choices she had to make nothing bad about the movie at all no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing might <UNK> the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as <UNK> and lord melbourne
<START> <UNK> at sea is evidently a pun on a gary cooper film souls at sea the title <UNK> describes the starring team stan laurel and oliver hardy who go on an ocean voyage to <UNK> <UNK> nerves only to run into escaped killer nick <UNK> as played by <UNK> <UNK> this criminal is both amusing and chilling making him a fine foil for the <UNK> comedic characters despite his powerful presence <UNK> never <UNK> the boys a tribute to stan and <UNK> <UNK> charisma that is as it should be since the boys are supposed to be the protagonists in this film br br such is the charm of laurel and <UNK> <UNK> that they elevate average material for <UNK> at sea has its slow spots for instance as a previous <UNK> has noted a bit where a doctor the delightfully <UNK> james <UNK> tries a balloon called lung <UNK> on ollie lacks punch the scenario is very episodic with the first part taking place in the <UNK> apartment almost completely unrelated to the second part where they go off to sea but on the whole the film is highly pleasant entertainment with a <UNK> brief running time so that it doesn't wear out it's welcome br br there's a certain <UNK> viewing the final collaboration between laurel and hardy and producer hal roach i haven't seen all of laurel and <UNK> post 1940 films but those that i have seen don't measure up to even the weakest hal roach products in these later movies laurel and hardy seem to be in an alien environment <UNK> of such colorful supporting players like <UNK> and charlie hall and marvin <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> musical scores they also aren't the well meaning and optimistic <UNK> we know and love but in the later films are either <UNK> <UNK> or pathetic <UNK> br br it is a pity that many hal roach laurel and hardy films are now generally <UNK> to the public even in a minor entry like <UNK> at sea one can see that laurel and hardy were great comedians this was because hal roach for the most part allowed stan laurel the <UNK> force behind the team complete artistic freedom once laurel lost his <UNK> at other studios the team lost much of its <UNK>
<START> no doubt intended as a totally campy joke full moon high portrays 1950s teenager tony walker adam arkin accompanying his father ed <UNK> on a trip to romania sure enough tony gets bitten and grows fur and <UNK> whenever there's a full moon a particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse and that he has to fulfill a destiny even if it takes twenty years br br but otherwise the movie's just plain funny once it gets going ed <UNK> character is an over patriotic right wing <UNK> he thinks that everyone should have listened to joe mccarthy kenneth <UNK> coach principal is a tense <UNK> and then there's more one of the most eye opening cast members is <UNK> wilson best remembered as <UNK> on <UNK> and son as a bus driver who gets a big surprise but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the <UNK> then gag with <UNK> ford really summed him up anyway it's a real treat considering that alan arkin who plays a zany psychiatrist just won an oscar on sunday night and <UNK> his sons i wonder whether or not he remembers co starring with two of them in this movie aside from adam his son anthony also has a small role quite funny also starring elizabeth <UNK> br br ps director larry cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick it's alive
<START> why oh why don't blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point everyone in the cinema young and old was there to see talking animals make jokes and whilst they did that we were all happy and then as with lost in space came the two killer blows plot and sentiment who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether eddie murphy made up with his daughter not me that's for sure
<START> years ago i found a bargain bin copy of this film for a buck or two in so many ways this is quite fitting as when it was made back in 1933 it was truly a cheaply made film by the poverty row studio <UNK> however while the film is rather derivative it is still well worth watching and provides a few surprises br br the story is very very familiar as in some <UNK> town the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires adding to this <UNK> is dwight frye he played <UNK> in dracula and here he is very very similar though he plays a much more harmless weirdo in this case he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths the film does a good job of providing some red herrings i e false leads and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out frye may not be responsible the who and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror film in addition while the production had little money to speak of it still had some good actors of the day lionel <UNK> and <UNK> douglas and it also used universal studios sets at night when they were done filming for the day as a result the film looks pretty good overall though i also thought that as usual fay <UNK> was terrible thought it didn't <UNK> detract from the film i have seen her in more movies than most people on imdb and i have come to notice that her characters have no depth she always seems to be cast as the screaming lady and provides little new in each film br br overall for fans of old horror films this is excellent and worth seeing for people who are not fans of the genre it's probably pretty skip able
<START> to put it simply i enjoyed this film the reason for my interest enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject matter itself i had heard tales from my mother and grandmother about how northern england working class life and attitudes used to be as experienced by them and this is an interesting depiction that seems to <UNK> represent what they told me in particular the <UNK> but overbearing father who knows what is best for his family along with his <UNK> when this <UNK> is challenged not much has changed there then br br people who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story does not easily transfer across the different media in a sense however the film is an historical document and i personally enjoyed it if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon
<START> this movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly 3 hours al pacino michelle <UNK> and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable the violence was a little extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film the ending is amazing and is <UNK> one of the coolest scenes ever great movie and you will probably really enjoy it
<START> as good an <UNK> for <UNK> as you're ever likely to see <UNK> is an everyday story of royal folk in late <UNK> century <UNK> set during one of <UNK> seemingly <UNK> internal <UNK> it concerns itself with the emperor <UNK> joseph mr james mason his rebellious son the crown prince <UNK> mr omar <UNK> the <UNK> miss <UNK> <UNK> and various <UNK> secret policemen spies <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dancers wives soldiers <UNK> horses and the bizarre <UNK> web of european <UNK> at the time of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hungarian empire filmed in what the old movie posters used to call a riot of color it resembles nothing more than an <UNK> dressed but intellectually challenged production of the student prince mr james mason wearing a very <UNK> little white number <UNK> his all purpose <UNK> european accent whenever he remembers i am a great admirer of his and i sincerely hope the <UNK> was <UNK> with the <UNK> he clearly felt for the character he was playing mr omar <UNK> who built a career largely <UNK> on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking <UNK> gives a <UNK> monotonous performance as his son the crown prince he is utterly unconvincing as a man who in the movie at least cut a <UNK> through the <UNK> side of the <UNK> <UNK> with his well <UNK> locks firmly in place he <UNK> and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms as a rebel he talks the talk but <UNK> fails to walk the walk leaving a bottom button <UNK> on one of his <UNK> is about as far as his <UNK> goes <UNK> married he falls in love with a <UNK> forbidden love is one of the movie's come <UNK> as she is played by the most <UNK> miss catherine <UNK> he is <UNK> pushing the <UNK> there miss <UNK> has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it particularly in the sequence set at the ballet now i love ballet as much as the next man but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time a more cynical critic might consider it to be padding <UNK> mother the <UNK> is played by miss <UNK> <UNK> she gives the part some good old american <UNK> making her a bit like <UNK> <UNK> but it's done with <UNK> style <UNK> is certainly very fond of his mother i'll put it no more strongly than that the only performance worth watching is that of mr james robertson justice as sir <UNK> <UNK> sorry edward prince of <UNK> he is so wonderfully <UNK> about everything going on around him it's a joy to behold i waited <UNK> for him to ask <UNK> the immortal question what's the bleeding time i am not <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> 's historical accuracy but in my opinion everything else about it is <UNK> it is a <UNK> opera <UNK> without the tunes to send you home from the theatre <UNK>
<START> literally every aspect of this science fiction low budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors <UNK> and those to follow bad special effects a weak storyline ridiculous amounts of blood and gore annoying and pointless characters all that you can expect attack of the <UNK> is about a new vacation resort where the <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cats for an attraction the cats escape and begin to kill people the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting <UNK> about them and there is a band of <UNK> and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats br br special effects wise the film is about an average achievement given its budget the <UNK> are portrayed through poor cgi amazingly though the cats look more realistic in an up close detailed shot rather than the longer more distant shots where the cgi is better <UNK> their attacks are <UNK> bloody and <UNK> just as you'd expect they attack rip off some arms and legs and leave very little behind this is part of the reason why the film <UNK> into poor schlock br br the plot and characters are just as horrendous we have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a <UNK> hunt and take it very very seriously even so much as to <UNK> on private property <UNK> with security systems and steal why are they taking a simple game so seriously did i miss something was there money involved or were they sent to do it i don't know i could barely follow the film but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it even so they went too far for normal br br attack of the <UNK> is a very poor film even for a low budget sci fi flick it is a very poor and cheap example it will bore most viewers to tears might be attractive for some and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through and keep in mind this is not a comedy this is a cheap horror flick so it's not suppose to be comical
<START> i watched it some years ago i remembered it as very mysterious situations and a mixture of <UNK> things like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovich br br i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version at any price please br br the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second a bit of <UNK> but also happy br br all the characters are great to me with funny situations great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema <UNK> this may not be <UNK> br br i think that the title is a hope about life you have to be happy and laugh as much as possible br br i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie but the fact is that i like it very much i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall but four things really stand out sam <UNK> perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy man alan <UNK> wonderful characterisation of the camp owner and best of all the cinematography the beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the <UNK> draws me into my own summer memories br br the dialog and mood feel very natural and believable some reviewers <UNK> the lack of a more profound script to me it is exactly that lack that makes this film work the characters and their problems seem real and because of that i care about what happens to them br br the bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right
<START> i've seen about <UNK> movies released between 1931 <UNK> and the informer is the worst major release i've seen from that time span awful despicable unpleasant unhappy <UNK> saga of a complete loser watch a 1934 b western instead
<START> this is one of the great movies of the 80s in my collection that i think about all the time br br the running man is one of arnold s best and most different films even to this day and when i first saw the running man i was so excited to see a movie like this i just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie it also has jesse <UNK> the legendary professor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the beautiful maria <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kurt fuller richard dawson and thomas <UNK> jr who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as universal <UNK> the lost world <UNK> cop 2 predator 2 and among others all arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed star filled and its one its one of arnold s best to date
<START> saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970's and hated hated hated it easily the most <UNK> movie i have ever seen in my life don't know where leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate the title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie just long long <UNK> with people unable to <UNK> what they are presumably feeling if you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you if you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a <UNK> in a <UNK> the experience will be infinitely more <UNK> than anything you will get from this yes leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss
