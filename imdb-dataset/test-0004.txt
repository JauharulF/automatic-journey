<START> if you liked the richard chamberlain version of the bourne identity then you will like this too <UNK> quinn does this one brilliantly you can't help but wonder if he is really out there i <UNK> he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it's so intense when i first saw it i was just <UNK> channels on the remote late one evening i got hooked within minutes look up www answers com for <UNK> <UNK> who is the character that carlos the is based on for both i remember reading about <UNK> arrest in the paper in 1997 it was front page for weeks through the trial after his arrest
<START> this little film brings back a lot of memories both fond and foul of what can and does happen when one is a working musician the not so pleasant <UNK> for the band the management of the <UNK> jumping up and down telling you what to play the sheer ecstasy of the applause far from being <UNK> it is in fact very accurate in the way it depicts musicians professional and otherwise who have <UNK> a great distance to perform a season of <UNK> at a <UNK> there are those times when everything goes perfectly there are those other times when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing this far from home in the end you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out
<START> how many disaster movies can there be before we get tired of them come on we can see them on the discovery channel all day long br br i agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera the great <UNK> makes a <UNK> and everybody starts <UNK> about how he is ruining the family name the evil mother in law convinces the wife to throw him out into the arms of his mistress whom she wants to meet can you believe that the wife wants to <UNK> the new wife at the same time the has someone in love with her that doesn't have a wife but she sends him <UNK> br br now that the soap opera is over the <UNK> appears br br the special effects are really good but the dubbing is bad that is why i like subtitled films the actors are all very experienced and have won many awards so you will get to see some of <UNK> best in an <UNK> repeated story br br but the soap opera story returns with a <UNK> ending
<START> six <UNK> tunnel sergeant dr death <UNK> <UNK> and blade help the young andre <UNK> take out <UNK> henchman in the best sequel this series has seen br br retro puppet master is atmospheric with many sets quality acting and some fun puppet fx what it lacks in gore it makes up for with an interesting well paced plot br br best quote dr death don't you know my friends smell the <UNK> see the smoke br br this is easily the best dave <UNK> film i've seen the actors do a more than credible job jack <UNK> as turns in an inspired performance and the young <UNK> does well with the puppets oh and the ring <UNK> is cool br br john score is a nice <UNK> take on the original puppet master tunes by richard band keeping the movie playful and eerie it's rare for a full moon score to actually add something to a film and this one does br br unfortunately dave allen didn't seem to be <UNK> enough for band and co in the late 90's and beyond so all of the puppet action is done rod and string there's no stop motion such as the famous and funny scene in the original where looking for his <UNK> and of course as with all of the full moon fare of this time period <UNK> was shot in and around <UNK> studios in <UNK> so most of the bit parts were cast to <UNK> hearing their <UNK> accents was a bit annoying br br all in all this is probably one of the top 10 full moon films it's certainly the most inventive of the puppet master sequels
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen it's supposed to be a remake or update of the one armed <UNK> by chang <UNK> the ham <UNK> direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren't even worth watching the script tries desperately hard to seem serious but is full of cliches like and i knew then that nothing would ever be the same again or if only i'd known what a heavy price i would have to pay ugh and who is that girl who plays sing someone find her and have her eliminated she's awful if you like chinese martial arts movies you'd be better off with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this stinks
<START> br br first of all i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed the la <UNK> br br i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in <UNK> br br so if you don't like this kind of music why you write here about it i like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus i know <UNK> from all over europe <UNK> so why do you who find this music <UNK> care to comment at all br br
<START> a giant praying <UNK> is <UNK> from its sleep in the <UNK> region and heads south causing havoc <UNK> planes and trains meet their match with the flying creature before <UNK> its full wrath on nyc the <UNK> meets its doom at the hands of the armed forces in a new york tunnel the special effects are of course crude by todays standards but for a ten year old boy in 1957 this was very memorable br br starring are william hopper craig stevens <UNK> and pat <UNK>
<START> seagal was way off the mark with this film i'm a fan of his and come to expect cool fight scenes and sharp one liners but this film had none of this instead it had <UNK> and cheesy music even if you're a fan of his i strongly recommend you keep away from this film and watch under siege or even on deadly ground instead
<START> this late ish effort from plays as a modern day 70's that is gothic thriller but comes out short of thrills certainly it's not a dreadfully bad film it's <UNK> got that feeling which many of later films have of someone who has given up when he's seen the first it starts out good enough almost giallo like in tone then takes a turn into gothic <UNK> with a decent albeit terribly cliché set up then suddenly seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of <UNK> keaton and burning <UNK> then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decent to poor special effects this is followed by a slow paced with a very obvious twist ending if it's even intended to be a twist and throw a few very <UNK> <UNK> scenes along the way and you got tragic ceremony thus in parts it's got its qualities but then suddenly stumbles and <UNK> in front of you a pity br br btw stay away from the dvd a useless murky pan <UNK> edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience
<START> what is it about drug addiction that so draws first time filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject this subject has been done to death drug abuse is bad we get it drug addiction is painful to watch we get that too but the bleak subject matter doesn't give the filmmaker license to make a sloppy film every film need not be <UNK> masterpiece of cinematic excellence or use orson <UNK> deep focus but it's still a narrative movie <UNK> does not mean pseudo documentary even <UNK> mini <UNK> cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks and this filmmaker is just being lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting the subject is bleak enough without <UNK> forcing it with sloppy cinematography and even documentary films have a sound mix vera <UNK> is very talented given the right material but the director obviously over directed her and sucked all the life out of her performance <UNK> may live in a fog but they still have emotions but none of these characters seem to exist off screen the supporting players merely delivered their lines without creating real people sorry to be so harsh debra but some things are true whether want to believe them or not i'm sure your next film will be better but please not another drug movie
<START> at the surface <UNK> high is a snappy ensemble comedy <UNK> as a period piece set in the early 60's complete with a flawless <UNK> soundtrack but there's so much more to this film it gets better every time i see it the cast of <UNK> at the time is excellent and it is notable as an all black cast film that doesn't fall into any clichés at times <UNK> high almost feels like an updated urban neo <UNK> film with lots of edgy humor added in at times the rather tight budget does show but the constraints actually serve the film well there's a <UNK> and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an <UNK> lacking in most similar minded films like later car wash which was more popular but largely pointless warm hearted but also true to life this might be one of the <UNK> of the 70s celebrated at the time it seems that few film freaks know about this one today their loss this is a fine fine film br br the bare bones pan and <UNK> dvd no widescreen is testament to just how little cared for this excellent film is
<START> <UNK> and the art of written and directed by david is a short film about a young man named david his friends call him <UNK> and what <UNK> in one strange day of his life <UNK> works as a for an upper middle class family the lady of the house tries to get <UNK> to help her cheat on her husband unfortunately her son walks in on them instead of her husband from this point on the movie starts to speed through many revelations between the characters along with the eventual involvement of the man of the house <UNK> and the art of <UNK> is witty smart and overall very well written the comedic timing of the actors is also very strong it's a fun light movie that i would strongly recommend
<START> <UNK> film from 1950 is given a <UNK> for the 80's <UNK> <UNK> dennis quaid is a university <UNK> who used to have a successful writing career but thats now gone down the <UNK> along with his marriage the initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him so when the revelation comes that he has been <UNK> we are not that surprised unless of course you are familiar with the original <UNK> after being told he has less than <UNK> to live decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students sydney fuller meg ryan but they find they have many obstacles in their way br br the film begins <UNK> in black and white as <UNK> <UNK> in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder his own but the <UNK> lewis style 80's beat that <UNK> this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad its only a question of how bad sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium but now the film <UNK> to full technicolor there are some brief <UNK> to noir as the <UNK> couple stand in front of a <UNK> blind but there's really nothing here to recommend it the performances are awful ryan in particular doing her usual <UNK> blonde with a <UNK> pie smile routine the film is a lazy attempt to put some <UNK> into an already fine movie premise obviously trying to cash in one the body heat audience the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure they are welcome to it 4 10
<START> seeing the names of the starring actors <UNK> snipes and <UNK> i thought that the movie should at least be <UNK> funny or interesting instead all i got from it was not just boring <UNK> minutes but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen and hearing tons of lame and <UNK> bad cop phrases br br the main problem is that the movie doesn't have a good story to begin with and when you have that than no one can help you not <UNK> not wesley snipes not even john <UNK> could save this movie it could be cool for the kids if they aren't over 12 years of age because they don't care so much about the story and there are some big explosions in the movie
<START> i just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the <UNK> battle of the 20th century i got what i had expected and so much more just to think i came across this movie by luck before i had never even heard of it it's a german film made in 1993 so i suppose i can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern american audience it's a shame cause this really is a remarkable film i dare say that its as good if not better then platoon full metal jacket apocalypse now and all quiet on the western front all of which are iconic war movies br br 1942 world war ii is in full swing nazi germany has over run <UNK> europe and parts of north africa then <UNK> hitler orders the full scale invasion of the soviet union a <UNK> move that ultimately <UNK> nazi germany to defeat in the early stages the invasion goes well and the german <UNK> <UNK> large sections of soviet territory but a critical battle ensues at <UNK> a city that hold great symbolic <UNK> value the battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions a nightmare for both the german russian soldiers fighting on the verge of taking the city the germans are suddenly counter attacked by the russians who end up cutting off the entire german <UNK> army inside <UNK> to make matters worse the russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the germans this entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young german soldiers fighting for survival not only against the russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own sadistic officers who care only about <UNK> glory and the <UNK> who have little regard for the average foot soldier br br this film is going to haunt me for a while the german soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive then their humanity sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic <UNK> often portrayed in film everything they were fighting for is no longer important and everything they believed in was <UNK> and after fighting a gruesome battle against the russians inside <UNK> we see them further <UNK> with the <UNK> of winter causing many to freeze to death the battle winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real it's amazing in the beginning we see <UNK> young men in the prime of their life and at the end they a <UNK> of their former <UNK> stripped of everything after witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on it was really sad when there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by hitler who ultimately <UNK> these men to a horrible death which is just another one of hitler's crimes <UNK> the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the russians br br a good anti war film depicts the horrors of war and that's what this movie does the battle for the <UNK> factory sequence is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth but that's really what the battle for <UNK> was like the german russian soldiers were depicted with humanity it was only the bad <UNK> specifically on the german side that doomed the men bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically emotionally during war we all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time what the average foot soldier endured at <UNK> was beyond imagination even if they had survived everything they had seen done would have <UNK> them for life br br <UNK> shows us why war is hell and what exactly hell looks like
<START> this film was just on two nights running on <UNK> dear oh dear someone actually bought this on the strength of robert ok i missed the start but what i did see was so bad i thought no i watched in embarrassment for the stars who were in it nothing was based on reality i doubt things would progress as they did in this film everything was poor about this film ok cgi but no reality the write up gave the impression of a cliff <UNK> end sorry i wasn't impressed yes formulaic couldn't guess the end from what i saw the military had the upper hand people doing the heroic stuff were given next to no time to do their thing it just wouldn't have happened that way it was worse than leave your brain at the door it was annoying as someone else said yeah right of course that would have happened not the credits mentioned <UNK> and canada so it was a co production missed the third party concerned i'll have to check back on this site i'm not usually this critical but this annoyed me
<START> based on the 2007 spy novel by david <UNK> body of lies tells the story of a cia <UNK> roger <UNK> <UNK> who is sent to jordan to track down an al <UNK> mastermind all the while <UNK> a narrow <UNK> of loyalty to his <UNK> <UNK> and his manipulative american boss ed hoffman <UNK> br br anybody who's seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double agent action and the betrayal of <UNK> by hoffman but the actual story is much more mundane instead we are served a tepid <UNK> of ridiculous <UNK> as white pretty boy american <UNK> moves with virtual <UNK> through the <UNK> streets of <UNK> jordan with <UNK> a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of attention from the locals only during a scene where <UNK> takes his new found iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality <UNK> as the couple are <UNK> with <UNK> from <UNK> men br br <UNK> the film's problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding <UNK> flies to jordan <UNK> gets <UNK> from jordan <UNK> flies to washington <UNK> flies to the uk <UNK> flies back to jordan hoffman flies to jordan hoffman returns home to take care of his kids  an on it goes this is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of the amazing race not a spy thriller br br in body <UNK> loyalty to his craft <UNK> gained an impressive <UNK> pounds of for the role of <UNK> ed hoffman thus joining the small <UNK> club of actors <UNK> of robert de niro and christian <UNK> as <UNK> who've subjected themselves to massive weight gain or loss for their roles it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share <UNK> level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub par mess
<START> now this movie is the worst i have ever seen it is simply a disaster i think it's really a sick movie i just wasted my time watching this cheap crap i can't believe anyone would produce such a disaster such a waste of money and time nothing to learn from this movie it's just a hollow sick evil flick i don't think they could've make it worse this movie just earned it's title as the king of lowest crap the acting is a disaster the meaning oh well there is no meaning just a sick pain and sorrow introduced by the suffering child in the end of the movie and the killing of the wife which again was another dumb blow to this movie do yourself a favor if you actually have some self respect keep away from this awfulness
<START> a good example of the differences between american and foreign cinema can be seen in a film i recently watched on television <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> two protagonists david and diane murphy are played woody <UNK> and <UNK> moore i'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me love affection <UNK> attraction  none of these <UNK> on screen in their interactions together br br since i knew that eventually robert redford would show up it was clear from the beginning that the good part the meat of the movie would be the scenes between him and <UNK> moore poor woody <UNK> just could not <UNK> any emotion at all for the film he seemed to be holding back <UNK> with his <UNK> <UNK> br br ok so fast forward what idiots these two diane and david are for thinking they can win back the 50 000 they owe by gambling no acting faux <UNK> there just <UNK> bad lazy unforgivable writing of course they lose all their money surprised i know i wasn't enter robert redford john gage in the film  a romantic perhaps emotionally <UNK> man an updated <UNK> a very good role and though not a great great actor next to those two redford looks like olivier he immediately falls in love and lust with diane and we the viewers for once feel it this is how to love a woman not david's way <UNK> <UNK> mouth to mouth with diane on a slimy <UNK> did i see that right as gage redford wears a suit and tie in every scene yes it's meant to <UNK> the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a rich man but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience <UNK> it other wardrobe symbolism includes david's now <UNK> shirts at the end of the film <UNK> resolve getting it together after a long <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> shirt wearing br br and what is it with california garden parties as depicted in hollywood movies suddenly everyone appears british complete with <UNK> dresses three piece suits for the men hats hats and of course the <UNK> yes diane her transformation to rich man's fiancée now complete is there at the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> though she insisted that she couldn't be bought she <UNK> at last to the sexual tension here is where the film <UNK> off into pure <UNK> i mean of course david and diane will end up together my question is why diane was bored with david why not let her ride the robert redford wave and i mean for a good long while how can she pull herself out of the sexual romantic <UNK> of this sexy older man so easily just because woody <UNK> brings his <UNK> <UNK> to the garden party sits himself down and looks <UNK> moore in the eyes that's just not how it goes he was so weak br br but we must have our happy ending we have to swallow the moral lesson we're not sophisticated enough yet to have it otherwise director <UNK> tried to make a fatal attraction for the <UNK> set the br br in addition to garden parties in which there's <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> shirt or baseball cap in sight such films also feature a reliable public <UNK> system that <UNK> far <UNK> california cities and how else to <UNK> the return to middle class or working class life
<START> this film made me so angry because of its stupidity that i felt the need to create an account on imdb to share with you my opinion i liked <UNK> <UNK> in a lot like love and this is why i still wanted to see this film despite it's current 4 2 rating it is highly over rated i trusted that an actor any of them would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such low now quality production it is very disappointing the theme of home sitting was much better used in <UNK> <UNK> male <UNK> things that did not make sense here fist of all the house owner leaves his precious pet with somebody who doesn't know anything about taking care of it secondly the rule is not to let anybody in the house but the house <UNK> fails to follow this simple rule the door is not locked and so on
<START> talk about false advertising i wasted an hour and twenty five minutes watching this piece of crap and there was not one <UNK> suit not one platform shoe no <UNK> finger dancing and not a single disco ball i watched it on a saturday night and ended up with an awful fever but it had nothing to do with the music br br seriously with or without john travolta this movie sucked br br from the opening scene you will be asking yourself the question where did that rope come from and will it please hang me too from its <UNK> bias against the driving abilities of the <UNK> dutch to the shameless promotion of the apparently <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> to the cheap horror effects lifted directly from japanese cinema this is the worst film to hit theaters since the grudge
<START> <UNK> describes his collaboration with as an equal <UNK> where they worked together to match image and music scene by scene unfortunately the sound recording was a disaster so for once the devotion to authenticity in <UNK> dvd's <UNK> fortunately there is at least one restored version of the film on vhs classics with an excellent re recording of the music by the st <UNK> <UNK> orchestra and chorus br br it is interesting to compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in england germany and the united states <UNK> film was made in 1938 in response to the fear of a german invasion and <UNK> in 1943 when a german invasion of england was still expected both films are <UNK> but in different ways olivier begins by showing a staged performance of the play in the globe theater by shakespeare's own company then takes us out of the theater to a more cinematic though still stylized setting <UNK> film is cinematic from the beginning but the dialog and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic acting conventions of the old russian theater this works very well for speeches as alexander because part of his job as a prince and military leader was to play a role in public br br in nazi germany the first major propaganda film was <UNK> <UNK> tedious triumph of the will which recorded a huge political spectacle crowds cheering hitler's <UNK> speeches the propaganda in her masterpiece the film of the 1936 berlin <UNK> is much <UNK> with its worship of the athletic male body carrying disturbing undertones of the <UNK> <UNK> myth but wartime german propaganda films could also be subtle karl <UNK> <UNK> on word of honor is typical it shows a young lieutenant letting the men in his company go on a 24 hour leave before returning to the wwi <UNK> and almost certain death against the advice of veterans he accepts their word of honor to return though he will be and shot if they don't naturally they all return though some of them <UNK> themselves for it presumably inspiring the audiences to similar displays of duty to their country br br in the united states one of the better wwii propaganda films was howard <UNK> air force in it we follow the <UNK> crew of a <UNK> as they bond to each other with the experience of battle and overcome obstacles to continue their part in the war typically for <UNK> films however their real loyalty is more to each other than to their country br br <UNK> has to reach far back in history to find any russian military <UNK> ironically alexander like the other russian <UNK> is <UNK> from the <UNK> who <UNK> up the russian rivers to <UNK> and rule their own <UNK> so he is a <UNK> <UNK> another would be <UNK> physically they are not that different though the actors portraying the german <UNK> were obviously chosen for their <UNK> and <UNK> stupidity but the real contrast is between the common soldiers the russian <UNK> are as tall and strong as the <UNK> whereas the german <UNK> who <UNK> out of the shield wall to kill wounded russians are a foot shorter than their masters there is some historical truth in this contrast russian in the middle ages were much better off than their european counterparts because they could always escape into the wilderness and clear their own land br br <UNK> film also cleverly gives us our first sight of alexander as a <UNK> in the battle with the germans he uses his <UNK> knowledge of the ice as well as his knowledge of their military tactics to defeat them when breaks the shield wall they are forced to <UNK> and mass on the west side of the lake where the ice is thinner br br one of the other pleasures of <UNK> film which most audiences miss is the historically accurate way that he portrays the politics of medieval russia cities like and <UNK> their growing wealth and <UNK> largely to trade which put the <UNK> into power and <UNK> the <UNK> until their military expertise and <UNK> were needed to <UNK> <UNK> in the film alexander is shown not only as a military leader but also as a master politician who knows how to wait for his time and how to make the most of his popularity after the victory
<START> the joy and tragedy of the christmas season lies in the fact that it mostly revolves around family that is why some people call it the children's holiday as we age natural and progress <UNK> the people and the things that gave us our special memories john denver in one of his <UNK> roles plays george <UNK> a successful nyc architect and new widower who lost his wife about a year earlier his life is focused around his 9 year old daughter alex both are still <UNK> their loss george is trying his best to make this a special christmas for his daughter enter his boss thomas <UNK> played by the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> of m a s h guy edward winters who sends george to <UNK> co to explore a possible real estate deal lying to his daughter that the purpose of the trip is a vacation rather than work george and alex fly into town where they're immediately met by a collection of loving generous but somewhat eccentric group of characters whose main <UNK> is that they all believe in santa claus <UNK> is a picture book community we'd all love to live in and we'd love the people for neighbors george soon meets a love interest in susan jane were it not for the grinch <UNK> it would be an ideal time but the fact is he is in town to find property for <UNK> to develop and there is a nice ranch near town about to be <UNK> and the dark edges of the movie <UNK> around the impending <UNK> and the reactions of the <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> i won't spoil the ending for those who've never seen the movie it's a typical happy christmas ending but it's handled in a fairly subtle and believable way that shows the best in the human spirit without being too <UNK> all in all this is a most pleasant way to spend a couple of your christmas tv hours john denver and jane have nice chemistry and james as alex does a real nice job i've always loved the work of mary <UNK> a recognizable character actress and all of the other cast members do a nice job with less <UNK> parts this is a regular christmas fare for my family i rate it 4 5
<START> i felt as though the two hours i spent watching this film may have been better served by perhaps going to the local used <UNK> and looking for old fashion magazines and <UNK> ads or perhaps by watching paint dry those two would have at least engaged my mind a bit more than india song the most frustrating part of sitting through this was that i could see what <UNK> <UNK> were trying to be created and the notion of these could have been interesting if they had been fleshed out more instead what happened was a presentation of an incoherent silly chain of with the same scenes <UNK> over and over to beat some sort of point into our senses br br i was <UNK> to <UNK> more time to this film by writing any sort of review except to perhaps warn other folks against this waste of time
<START> movie about two australian girls debbie <UNK> <UNK> and sue sue knight and what happens when they become girlfriends of two <UNK> guys br br i caught this at an art cinema here in america in 1981 technically i was still a teenager i was 19 so i was interested in seeing how australian teens acted script wise there's nothing new here it shows the usual teenage adventures dealing with dating sex suicide etc etc i always knew what was going to happen before it did but i was never bored what i found interesting was despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair these teenagers aren't much different than american teens they had many of the same difficulties and hang ups also this was based on a book from a real <UNK> girl and her true life adventures and i heard it was a faithful adaptation of it the acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and this was well made and pretty interesting so this is no <UNK> masterpiece but a pretty accurate portrayal of what it's like being a teenager and trying to be with the popular kids i give it a 7
<START> <UNK> means <UNK> this must be the condition of the script before the shooting of this film started and therefore throughout this film cries for content what you go for is an unusual love story between a 60 <UNK> old man and an 18 <UNK> old girl and what you get are very usual very common events that neither <UNK> nor surprise so what we are left finally is with <UNK> locations of <UNK> shot brilliantly by cinematographer <UNK> roy and camera friendly <UNK> of <UNK> khan this does not cover up for lack of a <UNK> script producer director ram <UNK> <UNK> who has such a good track record of films needs to pull up his <UNK> as far as mr bachchan goes i don't want to discuss him in context of this film br br while reviewing i am feeling loss of words i am left speechless rather <UNK> br br personal opinion this film can be compared with an equally bad film released some time back called black i don't see the difference between the <UNK> of lead characters in both the films what did you say just now that was a world class cinema blah blah and i don't have any taste well take a walk no i don't mean literally but actual one to the theaters showing this film because in that case you might find this film an oscar level material
<START> this movie is an incredibly self indulgent character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as an actual story it was utterly painful to watch and had i not been <UNK> in to buy the dvd because of john travolta and the positive buzz i would not have finished watching it br br this film lacks anything resembling an interesting premise and seems to rely on <UNK> and frankly heavy handed characterization there is one <UNK> scene between and bobby long in which a tv is destroyed that when played out is incredibly <UNK> and ill timed br br i found myself caring less and less about the characters as i watched it it was probably very fun film school wise to make it but it is just awfully boring to watch a indulgent and pretentious film school project you should not waste money on
<START> although this episode was offensive to the syndrome association others thought it was funny while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season br br this episode was funny and just shocking south park has made history as being their first episode with the most <UNK> words unless you count the movie as an episode br br i enjoyed how they made fun of chris <UNK> and his television show to catch a predator i didn't like the idea on how they thought chris <UNK> would do a show on and let a boy speak out and bash the jews br br one thing i did not like is how south park thought that people with syndrome would just <UNK> out bad language like that i've seen people on television with syndrome and they do not just <UNK> out bad words unless i am incorrect
<START> apparently in the eyes of some there aren't enough horror films these days involving young people being chased across a desert by a mysterious <UNK> madman in a truck i mean all we have so far is joy ride wolf creek <UNK> <UNK> monster man among others rest stop may very well be the worst out of those it is about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind to start over together in california along the way they stop at a <UNK> <UNK> so the young lady can <UNK> herself but when she returns she finds that her boyfriend and his car are gone from there she learns that the <UNK> is a guy driving a yellow pickup who proceeds to stalk and <UNK> her as she hides in the <UNK> this movie is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring the acting is annoying the gore is mild and the killer whose identity is not revealed throughout the entire movie is anything but memorable terrible terrible film
<START> mild spoilers br br in this would be satire chaplin set his sights on the <UNK> of german <UNK> playing the twin roles of dictator and one of his subjects an <UNK> world war i hero and jewish <UNK> through events inspired by both <UNK> hitler and the marx brothers <UNK> <UNK> and declares war on <UNK> whilst finding time for numerous oddly flat set pieces the <UNK> much celebrated <UNK> with an globe is actually entirely <UNK> <UNK> and unfunny br br chaplin should certainly be <UNK> for looking to lampoon hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloid his much <UNK> final speech is actually the bold memorable highlight of the piece but the film simply isn't sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently <UNK> upon it nor to demand repeated viewings the best gags are away from tiresome <UNK> and involve the <UNK> attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb a sequence which steals from the gun <UNK> in the gold rush and later with a pot on his head accidentally walking the <UNK> off the roof of his shop br br compared to the director's silent classics the great dictator is slow wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat <UNK> whilst the <UNK> spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure there is no doubt that chaplin was a genius but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and the great dictator certainly ranks as such
<START> don't get me wrong i love stephen king and this is a pretty good movie over all the <UNK> <UNK> is very scary and the movie is suspenseful but after the first few minutes that poor donna and her little son tad were held captive in their <UNK> by the <UNK> st bernard i began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself br br she could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards i mean it was a <UNK> for <UNK> sake and they were on a downhill <UNK> and rolled to safety but then it would have been a very short movie when she got the car started did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the <UNK> no she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad she did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby what a waste of time i mean if you're going to make a run for the bat do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with but forget the bat were there no tools in the car like a tire iron or something i didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car really why wait until you're bitten and weak from and your son is having <UNK> before you make a stand against the animal br br at the end of the movie she was <UNK> and torn but by god she was still wearing high heels
<START> i watched this film many years ago on tv and taped it from there i could never really understand why my own mother was upset watching it it was because i was so young at the time i have just sat and watched this film again i now have 2 children of my own and i had to try and fight the tears back but that didn't happen i was crying through most of the film it just to show how different you feel when you have children of your own such an amazing family such a heart wrenching film truly wonderful someone has said about 8 still living any more news are you all still in touch i would love to know touched by the film all over
<START> this is the kind of movie that begs to be shown on tv at 3 or 4 in the morning if at all br br no doubt the film makers responsible for attack of the 50 foot woman thought they were making a <UNK> statement about women and <UNK> and the dangers of the demon <UNK> all wrapped up in a sci fi allegory br br or maybe it was a tax write off br br either way attack proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances a extreme <UNK> b seen on a double bill with any of those <UNK> suzanne movies maybe once is not enough or c just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect pop in attack and you'll feel great guaranteed br br it's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script the <UNK> special fx and that four eyed sheriff and i think the last line should be <UNK> in a <UNK> somewhere in washington d c it's just that memorable br br four stars for attack of the 50 foot woman buy a copy mail it to gloria <UNK> she'll love you for it
<START> despite what its critics ensue i enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is <UNK> for both sides of the gender spectrum <UNK> has done the artsy hard edge stuff before won oscars is at the top of his game <UNK> 12 is light commercial <UNK> <UNK> day at the <UNK> if you will i am generally not a fan of zeta jones but even i must admit that kate is stunning in this movie it's ending screams of an upcoming and i will be one of the millions who flock to see <UNK> minutes of george and brad and matt through <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as they <UNK> some rich bad guy again and again if we <UNK> 3 <UNK> of the lord of the rings i ask if we can <UNK> over <UNK> salt and pepper <UNK> just one more time
<START> what a crappy movie the main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in canada yet he had a <UNK> indian accent than his parents is it just me or does look gay in this movie also do all the chicks in canada dress like <UNK> at least that's how it is in this movie all the females are dressed like <UNK> don't waste your time with this one the only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful <UNK> wonder why bollywood is going through a <UNK> it's because of movies like this i miss the good days when hindi movies were actually entertaining i couldn't even finish this movie because it was so bad i think bollywood needs to stop trying to <UNK> the style of hollywood because it's just not working out they need to stick to their roots because that's what makes indian movies entertaining
<START> the rating is not necessarily a <UNK> this movie was done on a low budget but done well within its limits br br a usual pot <UNK> plot ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space people and prisoner escape in <UNK> land on unknown planet where their presence wakes something up mayhem ensues a lot of <UNK> is <UNK> br br the special effects were spare and properly done <UNK> future technology with <UNK> displays and controls instead of relying on <UNK> cheap looking plastic props plus the pacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to <UNK> into boredom where they start picking things apart br br i <UNK> this one as a <UNK> saturday afternoon flick you can get up and hit the <UNK> without <UNK> it and it'll still be enjoyable even better your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without <UNK> your enjoyment and she'll be happy after all she got to talk to you it's that type of movie br br anyways the actual story line has s few holes in after they hit the planet but hey this is a guns <UNK> <UNK> action movie cohesive story lines are not necessarily required so long as you have beer and <UNK> at hand so don't get get yourself into a brain <UNK> over the ending
<START> found a copy in a bargain bin sale of this old time classic i played it with on a <UNK> machine without any issues it's <UNK> dated heavily but what do you expect for a 12 year old game the game is a <UNK> adventure game hybrid it's what i call pseudo 3d you can't look up or down just spin in <UNK> think game play can get <UNK> with a very limited supply of health <UNK> and a somewhat average <UNK> tip press i but on the whole it's passable br br one main strength of the game is the mood there game heavily uses full motion video and whilst the acting is b grade and the plot is very choppy the game as a whole feels genuinely creepy it also does a good job of making you question the <UNK> <UNK> are they really helping or are they just waiting to stab you in the back the other major selling point is the games length there are from memory 18 chapters which range in game play time from <UNK> to potentially hours my first play through took me a week with some serious devotion of time br br dated yes but if you missed this years ago and can find it for 5 give it a look cheaper than a movie and more entertaining than most movies
<START> this is based on michael's life from 1983 4 till 2004 <UNK> alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don't believe he was even though he trusted the wrong people at times i thought <UNK> alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white i think should of been portrayed in this she was always <UNK> with her brother in the 80's i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts there were some things that were inaccurate lisa marie <UNK> son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when lisa and michael got married also when michael says to his mother <UNK> he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child it was idea for the two to get married
<START> this was a fantastic movie about two people one a young teenage girl and the other a middle aged man who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain <UNK> left by former loved ones br br both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to the script although written by seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view and at the same time men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie br br the end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless i would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one it is clear in this film that you are not alone
<START> i was looking for attack on <UNK> 13 there the film is that memorable who is the star of this ethan hawke or matt dillon i can't tell who the lead actor is that's a pretty big point against the movie right there gabriel <UNK> who <UNK> have needed the money this badly could he <UNK> de <UNK> is stunning but only because of her amazing body it took me ages to finally work out she's <UNK> sister off friends i agree that the so called <UNK> people attacking the station are pretty crap as far as tactics go we were even taught better basic skills than this in <UNK> basic training br br avoid this even the snow doesn't want to fall on a bus full of prisoners very bad continuity indeed br br avoid like the plague
<START> this film was bad i believe <UNK> or is it mike wong starred in it anyway it was the wong that didn't have that goofy grin and looks <UNK> he plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage he <UNK> and gets revenge gordon liu is the only one worth seeing in this film but he doesn't get to do much but what little he does seems to make the br br others pale in comparison also the film has some cheesy rubber <UNK> that the wong guy controls this film is not worth renting or buying
<START> so we're supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle to the <UNK> just to find out why her fiancée didn't travel to switzerland or are we supposed to take it seriously it's not even remotely funny clever or entertaining it's stupid and so is the movie the lead actress is one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a movie even worse than jar jar <UNK> dialog tries very hard to be funny almost all the time but it never is the number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing and as for the plot did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for other than being anti government i guess that didn't matter to anyone neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just <UNK> flew to the battlefield don't waste your time is neither funny nor entertaining
<START> this movie tries to rip off predator but that movie is much better this movie has truly terrible special effects and a mindless plot the team that enters the forest to find the cause of the <UNK> of military and scientist is a <UNK> of rough and rugged male <UNK> <UNK> and pretty but tough female rangers none of them are too bright all the characters seem to be more than willing to run off into the forest alone and <UNK> into a <UNK> or sword and their death some of the <UNK> are very big and must have cost a <UNK> but the close ups of the creature are laughable as are most of the death scenes every cliché that the writers could think of was used if you're looking for a mindless slaughter fest this may fill the bill the night i watched this was very slow so i sat through the whole thing i have to admit that it's been a while since i watched something this bad there is very little to redeem this movie i'm amazed that junk like this gets produced
<START> i cry at a lot of movies call me sentimental call me one of those viewers who always likes to see a happy ending this movie though it has a sad ending was great of all of the actors that i would love to have lunch with it would be sidney <UNK> his acting along with john cassavetes and jack warden of 12 angry men fame is stellar his character who befriends a man on the run cassavetes and helps him out in every way possible is incredible br br this is another one of those forgotten <UNK> made during the end of the <UNK> era it is well done has a superb cast extremely talented acting and great cinematography it is a film worth watching over and over again i highly recommend this one this is just another truly great film done by mr <UNK> and should be sold on dvd even though i cried kudos to such great art
<START> a masterful performance by jamie foxx is just one of the highlights of ray a 2004 film also starring <UNK> washington <UNK> king curtis armstrong richard <UNK> sharon warren patrick and many others all giving excellent support to the film br br the film has several main focuses the first is <UNK> childhood the drowning of his brother george which haunted him for years the <UNK> that <UNK> him and the strength taught him by his mother don't bend don't break don't ever be a <UNK> she eventually sends him to a special school where <UNK> gift of music is discovered the next focus is <UNK> artistic evolution as a <UNK> king cole like singer to his <UNK> of <UNK> music his <UNK> into country music and the unique sound that became ray charles the third focus is <UNK> personal life his marriage to <UNK> his many affairs his heroin addiction and eventual <UNK> br br because charles lived a packed <UNK> years there's a lot <UNK> though charles was <UNK> while in his teens the death of his beloved mother his rock isn't in the film while he is shown on the circuit and <UNK> to play in <UNK> <UNK> his near <UNK> as a musician isn't covered at one point he found a jar of <UNK> and attempted to eat it but the jar broke he was that down and out <UNK> is shown with him when the state of georgia which banned him <UNK> georgia on my mind as their theme song in 1979 and <UNK> charles back to his native state yet he and <UNK> were divorced in 1977 which isn't mentioned she probably was there however also she wasn't his only wife he was married once before he met her that marriage isn't covered in the movie we're told of one <UNK> child there were 12 it would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film br br what isn't <UNK> is his glorious music which seems to go on constantly throughout the film continually <UNK> his genius and artistry br br <UNK> story is compelling and holds the audience's interest throughout those who <UNK> at it as a made for tv movie don't give it the credit it deserves taylor direction gives ray a good pace and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully br br as ray jamie foxx <UNK> the character and makes one forget he's a comedian playing a part foxx wore <UNK> did his own piano playing and spent a great deal of time with charles preparing for the role he nails him but it's not an <UNK> he's a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother's body a man full of denial about his addiction hating the word <UNK> and believing he's not hooked and he's in denial about his home life thinking that his wife doesn't know about his various affairs and <UNK> children in the movie child and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his <UNK> who refuses to be walked on later on he demands to be paid in 1 bills so they can be counted when he discovers he's a <UNK> train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal he makes his own deal and leaves his job br br one doesn't so much marvel at <UNK> performance as accept him as ray from the first time he appears on camera br br this is an excellent biography which like walk the line is <UNK> with the fantastic music of the artist whether or not you're a ray charles fan ray is something to experience
<START> i don't know why critics cal it bizarre and macabre i really don't dark yes bizarre no it i s sad and with lots of emotions specially with the story they say it has elements of s m but i really don't find anything of that sort except for <UNK> whip br br this movie is deeper than its genre and villains aren't just some crazy freaks dressed like on a <UNK> they have strong motives with strong feelings involved <UNK> a great performance by michelle isn't just a sexy chick who likes <UNK> she's on her personal <UNK> and well by the end of the movie you really feel sorry for him strong performance by danny <UNK> again i think michael keaton is the best batman and he carries his costume well br br you can totally see that it is a tim burton movie because he has an unusual style and is a very talented guy but also the music is fantastic and fits the emotions
<START> warning spoilers ahead even if i doubt that anybody hasn't seen this yet br br the movie starts off rather well but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a corny <UNK> sweet predictable and unrealistic <UNK> mess i mean it's very obvious that there are serious problems in the main characters' marriage but these problems are never solved but just forgotten br br basically as soon as she decides to have a baby behind his back without even asking all of their problems magically disappear without a trace or an explanation given what had happened up until that moment it would have been far more logical if the marriage fell apart rather than becoming the trite and <UNK> <UNK> a baby will change ending br br the two main characters' families and <UNK> are also extremely one dimensional and don't seem to serve really any purpose if not to <UNK> the viewer and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the <UNK> start br br i am sorry to be ripping this movie but given the start i would have expected something more 4 10 for me
<START> despite its title is not really about drugs in the best tradition of <UNK> british tv drama <UNK> and about its <UNK> subject which is not some mythical <UNK> but a matrix or process with <UNK> social economic and historical roots causes and effects there is something almost scientific in the way the film takes four sets of characters from spectacularly separate global and class backgrounds a <UNK> <UNK> forced into the <UNK> underworld by poverty and a cynical government the english ex olympic <UNK> wife of a drugs baron on trial for <UNK> two <UNK> german policemen whose determination to convict the latter <UNK> as much from class anger as any faith in the law and a <UNK> junior minister whose <UNK> student daughter has become an addict br br is <UNK> <UNK> from the early scenes of jack <UNK> in <UNK> investigating the <UNK> success in <UNK> drugs before <UNK> more british aid we are <UNK> with facts about the problem but these <UNK> come from a variety of sources government <UNK> left wing lawyers with <UNK> <UNK> and domestic interest in the corruption poor <UNK> who need to grow to survive br br facts normally <UNK> <UNK> on a map are clearly not enough the more facts we get the less the situation seems it is not until jack the film's moral centre the man who <UNK> all the narrative threads actually <UNK> into the heart of the drugs darkness learns to shed his <UNK> <UNK> the use of drugs but <UNK> to put any serious money into <UNK> the problem and creating the conditions through various free market where drug <UNK> just as the anti heroes of the old <UNK> gangster films were actually model american <UNK> so the are the ideal being <UNK> by <UNK> and reagan that at least the reality of the problem can be <UNK> br br like i say isn't really about drugs as jack finally <UNK> after being <UNK> as a <UNK> minister drugs isn't really the problem it's a society <UNK> by a woman who said there was no longer any such thing as proved by jack's non existent family life <UNK> <UNK> the vast majority of people of hope and happiness increasing numbers of whom turn to drugs br br what is most frightening about is not the graphic numbing depictions of drug abuse the technical detail of which ironically reflects the presentation of more <UNK> verbal factual information but the <UNK> vision of a britain stripped of any joy beauty or community a bleak <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and soulless <UNK> a society of ready for the <UNK> <UNK> and to <UNK> their trade br br this isn't just a contemporary british story it records the decline of an empire built on trade reduced to <UNK> drug it is surely significant that the other sites in the programme are germany and <UNK> crucial agents in the <UNK> decline here the old <UNK> <UNK> comes home to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> victims their bodies abused by their <UNK> power returning to the <UNK> centre london the <UNK> of its decline literally carried in their bodies <UNK> the fears of all those late 19th century gothic novels br br is one of the great achievements of british tv and is in many ways superior to the recent hollywood remake the political focus is obviously <UNK> jack's decline is much more effective than because he as agent of government policy as well as a bad father is very much part of the problem whereas the <UNK> only real political flaw is <UNK> in almost every case characterisation is <UNK> and much more plausible compare lindsay <UNK> <UNK> helen already bitten by experience and failure and her <UNK> superficial counterpart br br unlike the dubious racial <UNK> of making mexico dark and other the ultimate <UNK> horror being sex with a black man the portrait of <UNK> is richly <UNK> drawn with <UNK> arguments about drug protection <UNK> by scenes of gruesome violence throughout the <UNK> of public and private is expert visually the film is remarkably inventive without ever being flashy or especially in the last episode where the buildings and <UNK> seem to move as the system <UNK> in if like its remake feels the need to shore <UNK> then the <UNK> sense of waste and loss is much more <UNK> jack's speech <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i have found this epic to be of an astonishing striking even heartbreaking beauty some kind of in beauty and <UNK> <UNK> a magnificent dramatic movement and <UNK> the choreography <UNK> is hugely enjoyable the actors are thoroughly enjoyable i have been a big fan of <UNK> tiger  as well but this one was even better they have <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> in what is <UNK> this beauty <UNK> adventure cinema is an act of courage when was the suspense so exquisite and genuine and the art of showing huge crowds gigantic <UNK>  the film has something deeply satisfying and a <UNK> good taste there is an enormous pleasure in making such a deliberately <UNK> and clean show  it's good beyond words few few adventure films let alone epics gave me such an <UNK> delight br br fan can be monumental not monumental is monumental fun like <UNK> movies like some '60s epics also like the <UNK> trilogy it is fun
<START> john barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief <UNK> while no one knows for sure this is the case the inspector lionel barrymore is sure of it but cannot prove it so lionel spends much of the movie following john hoping to catch this brilliant and <UNK> thief br br although i liked the film i really think i had higher expectations for it and thought it might be better than just a very good time <UNK> that's because it paired john and lionel barrymore in the film and since these brothers were such dynamic actors i think i expected sparks and magic but instead only caught glimpses of it here and there now this is not to say this is a bad film it certainly isn't it just didn't rise to the level of being unforgettable or a film i strongly recommend you see thanks an adequate script the film is pretty good but i was surprised to hear no french accents at all in the film even though it was supposedly about french people also there just wasn't much life in the film until it was nearly complete the ending was indeed excellent and entertaining so good that it <UNK> the film from a 6 to a 7 it's nice to see it ended on a high note
<START> a woman in love with her husband he's <UNK> decides to have a baby to save his life she's been to a <UNK> clinic as has the lover she takes so both know how artificial <UNK> works but instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world the 5 turkey they engage in <UNK> we also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancée he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to <UNK> further even though this is a business <UNK> the first time she's with her <UNK> <UNK> she takes off all her clothes as if it's a seduction plus her husband doesn't notice when 30 000 goes missing from their bank accounts does all this seem to demand more willing suspension of disbelief than even most hollywood fare far fetched on all counts
<START> i like j horror anime and even kinda dig the pink movement which some have claimed this a member of but this did nothing for me i willing to go a step further and label this one of the biggest let downs of my film watching career br br three young go around getting their kicks out of <UNK> girls one of the group starts to develop a about their pass time when his kid sister nearly catches them in the act <UNK> the group turns on itself as the once friends begin fighting with each other it ends on a down note <UNK> the film as a whole br br aside from watching the friends yell at each other which they do a lot there isn't a whole lot going on here the film is <UNK> with long <UNK> shots that only <UNK> the issue on top of that even when the film starts to do something interesting it suddenly gets <UNK> down in <UNK> philosophy that never makes any sense for instance after one of the buddies has his change of heart about <UNK> girls he goes out and does it again but then stops his buddies from taking their turns huh the cinematography is slow and lighting is poor the writing is ok as is the acting which makes this a sub par cinematic effort from the start mix the lack of technical <UNK> with the flimsy content and you have nothing more than a waste of time br br oh and one more extra note at least one of the girls that appears in the buff does not look old enough to be doing that kinda stuff br br 3 10
<START> 'a new <UNK> is the third <UNK> entry to base its plot around writer john g <UNK> premise of an item taken from the long island house that causes <UNK> misery and death for its new owners first a <UNK> then a clock and now a mirror however this is also the first <UNK> since 'the to directly tie in to the real life events that started the whole series this time around <UNK> terry robert <UNK> an artist is given a macabre looking mirror by a homeless man one day soon enough people around him start to die eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the <UNK> house indeed on the very night a man named franklin sonny in <UNK> murdered his entire family unfortunately for terry his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely <UNK> and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood br br this <UNK> installment in the often worn out franchise is something of a disappointment for me things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven yet entertaining <UNK> about <UNK> and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots not the first episode but the source material itself it should have been better than it was br br however three <UNK> to the same well with yet another evil <UNK> from the <UNK> house with yet another explanation for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is wearing on me to say the least one of the biggest weaknesses of the <UNK> franchise is the <UNK> determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series on the one hand it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity but at the very least they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly not repeat them over and over again br br there's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds <UNK> due to the <UNK> this <UNK> fest brings since you already know what's going to happen the carefully paced build up is simply slow and tedious or maybe it's just tedious anyway director john probably could have done more to <UNK> the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> voices which lacks any kind of subtlety there were times when characters seemed fairly <UNK> by its <UNK> qualities if they don't take it too seriously why should we br br which is a shame because 'a new <UNK> has a more than capable cast i was going to hold off on watching this until i saw the name in the credits she captivated my attention just as she always does and if anything i was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive terry <UNK> was equally charismatic and again underused <UNK> himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> square <UNK> hero type and while i'm not sure he really gave it the <UNK> needed it's not as if anyone here is performing <UNK> br br the sets are also worthy of note from the dramatic artwork filling room to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback supernatural sequences getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to <UNK> <UNK> memories clearly is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror unfortunately it is meant to be a horror film after all br br 'a new <UNK> sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should however it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours honestly the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'the for whom the story won't be such a massive <UNK> <UNK> trip
<START> i'll admit that i've never seen waiting for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> acclaimed comedy <UNK> about a small town thats that stages a <UNK> when the advertising for best in show had the <UNK> from the team that brought you waiting for <UNK> a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film for shame critics for shame times two any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world but this is one film that i hope people will experience now that its video dvd best in show is without a doubt the best comedy of 2000 br br the film begins with a <UNK> style introducing the main <UNK> not to mention <UNK> of the <UNK> best in show competition where dogs of all <UNK> come to compete to see who is the top dog we have the <UNK> and harry pepper guest with his the simple <UNK> cookie <UNK> levy o'hara with their nut case <UNK> hamilton meg <UNK> hitchcock posey the gay dog scott <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ann ward <UNK> <UNK> along with her <UNK> christy <UNK> lynch they all have their minds on one simple object the blue <UNK> which will be awarded to the best dog and do i have to tell you the rest br br director writer star <UNK> idea of humor is one that <UNK> me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at and that the idiocy of films like american pie or other pointless teenage flicks won't take over the world after all his idea is simple make your comedy not just funny but smart funny but instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like zero effect and high <UNK> he used a rather unusual approach and as i understand he also used this approach for <UNK> whether you notice or not a very large part of the film is <UNK> in other words what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script maybe even not even <UNK> of by guest and co writer star levy but with a gentle hand from guest he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have <UNK> if handled by other less <UNK> actors now that's smart br br the cast is of course what makes <UNK> work the most all of them are a comedic marvel to behold especially guest as pepper but the real standout has to be fred as buck <UNK> the clueless <UNK> at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no <UNK> would even dream of that is if the <UNK> was trying to be funny can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can <UNK> press there's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing <UNK> have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like have a <UNK> style of a time its priceless as is his performance br br i hope that people engage in this 90 minute the film deserves so much recognition it did get nominated for best picture comedy at the golden <UNK> but didn't win i can't see why i mean in the comedy department it is best in show br br grade a
<START> lowe returns to the nest after yet another failed relationship to find he's been assigned to jury duty it's in the plans to somehow get out of it when he realizes the <UNK> is the girl he's had a serious crush on since the first grade br br through living in the past by telling other people about his feelings towards this girl played by camp lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear camp of attempted murder while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time and <UNK> in creating a successful film at the same time br br i've heard that st <UNK> is the oldest city in the us and i also know it has some ties to de leon so the backdrop is a good place to start unfortunately it's the only thing good about this movie the local police are inept the judge is an idiot and the defense <UNK> does everything in her power to make herself look like <UNK> cunningham i don't know whether to blame the director for poor direction or for just letting the cast put in such a hapless effort br br in short this movie was so boring i could not even sleep through it 1 out of 10 stars
<START> there were heist movies before this one and indeed the likes of <UNK> were an obvious influence on it but the red circle is more than just another entry in an <UNK> genre and with this film director jean pierre <UNK> has managed to create something that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience something to think about being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters and <UNK> delivers that with this film in <UNK> the tone of the film is very relaxed too and <UNK> allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior the story has a number of angles but the central character is corey a thief who is released from prison his release <UNK> with the escape of infamous murderer <UNK> who slips from under the nose of police <UNK> mattei during a train ride the first thing corey does upon release is steal some money from his former boss rico and the second thing he does is <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> to help him pull of a jewel heist but rico and the police are hot on the <UNK> <UNK> br br the film is <UNK> together by four excellent central performances <UNK> <UNK> is calm and <UNK> as the film's anti hero while <UNK> maria looks <UNK> in his role as the escaped murderer <UNK> <UNK> is good also as a dubious club owner while the real standout performance comes from <UNK> in his role as the police <UNK> the film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill ride however the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements the film does feature crime film <UNK> such as shootings but they are kept to a minimum the first two thirds of the movie are really just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end <UNK> was most famous for its heist sequence an <UNK> designed scene in which nobody speaks a word the heist in this film is similar in that it is also <UNK> and i have to say that i preferred the scene in <UNK> but <UNK> skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it the film <UNK> down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely overall this might not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow but the red circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece
<START> double shock is one of the many good columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie br br it has all the elements we like in the columbo episodes we get the laugh when columbo makes something clumsy and it happens more than once in double shock i can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode br br we also get the <UNK> as usual with an almost perfect murder but something about the murder troubles columbo the end is the usual we get the story about how columbo solved the mystery br br this is another good columbo episode and i will rate it 7 10 it is close to 8 10 br br just one more question the acting peter falk is very good as usual
<START> in case you're wondering the <UNK> loren c n of <UNK> is a living idiot and any information he's provided is to be tossed out with the trash the guy simply is a news paper <UNK> br br as for the story line it was was a predictable train wreck the actors were mechanical the lighting was awful and the props clothing was cheap br br <UNK> should have starred over the <UNK> in this film i was physically ill after seeing ten minutes of it br br there are insane retarded monkeys still in charge of films i see br br dan
<START> personally i have no problem with the acting nor the script i do have a problem with the giant bird it was simply awful plain and simple br br one's first <UNK> is the roll around laughing when one sees it what were they thinking budget be damned the monster bird was a monstrous joke br br of course in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as and <UNK> then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast oh well what is done is done this will be the case of the eternal joke on them that was <UNK>
<START> i rented this one by accident i lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought shameless blair witch rip off then in a moment of <UNK> i grabbed 'the thinking it was something else my horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer boring characters bad acting and a feeling of <UNK> saw the blair witch project and could do the <UNK> <UNK> the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits i'm not one to fault film makers for being lazy or desperate but after this yawn fest i felt the need to warn everyone don't waste your time you have a life
<START> i'm from texas so i thought i knew big hair but the female villain in this movie had <UNK> hair whenever she was on the screen i couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair take about stage presence there seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also there was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner <UNK> toward the car screaming at the top of his <UNK> until he hit the car then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge <UNK> coming at him until it was 5 feet away all the hit men in this movie seemed a bit deaf no one had to sneak up on them the one handed <UNK> of this movie was so whiny and <UNK> that it was funny the bar fight was pretty funny there is a priceless scene where the hero and his girlfriend just had sex and judging from their expressions it wasn't good for either one of them it made me laugh out loud this movie is on the 50 movie pack martial arts set if you want to see a lot of bad movies with a few decent ones
<START> o dear god i suffered having to watch this film four times in my sisters house and was it dreadful a story of sex and guns and very cheap unexplained acting unless you are at <UNK> being told to watch this avoid it <UNK> rule just proved he cannot act <UNK> <UNK> also gave the most dreadful acting ever in any of his films there was not one part of this film made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion i would be surprised people actually enjoyed this i have seem some dreadful films in my life but this would be in my five worst films ever the music in it wasn't good and the storyline i think was made up by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down wrote ten bullet points and then made it into a film absolutely dreadful
<START> i have to agree with all the previous <UNK> this is simply the best of all <UNK> comedies with <UNK> as sexy as marilyn monroe ever was and definitely with a <UNK> face maybe there's less <UNK> but look how marilyn paid for that i don't think i've ever seen such a <UNK> looking female on screen so perfect that even a gay man like me got excited by it and not just for purely aesthetic reasons if the idiot really want to do their a number they are really going to need to up their standards as no church mice need apply here her breasts the rest of her figure her adorable voice the hilarious way she shakes as she walks across a room only to arrive in front of a man breasts literally pointed as if in exquisite confrontation br br i think boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all of film history no one played opposite more great female stars than did he garbo <UNK> k hepburn <UNK> and here <UNK> among many others and he was also in with leslie caron and had small parts in <UNK> to steal a with a hepburn as well as being in the <UNK> movie 'the april although not opposite her the only thing i could disagree with in remarks is that even the loud obnoxious music over the opening credits is appropriate i mean <UNK> is not meant to be subtle on top of everything else and her essential <UNK> i don't mean her voice is part of her irresistible and one might even say <UNK> charm br br <UNK> is thoroughly handsome even if <UNK> <UNK> says toward the beginning 'i don't know why i am in love with you you're not even handsome ' br br dear dear <UNK> truly one of the wonders of the 20th century not to mention the joy that she is still with us when so many of the truly <UNK> are passing away so fast in all her eccentric glory
<START> this is one of the most anti traditional war movies about was i have seen instead of the typical films that stress glory and perhaps super human characters like john wayne this film is the exact opposite <UNK> the de <UNK> that also happens in war the story concerns the japanese who are stranded in the <UNK> after the us returned in late 1944 early 1945 by the time the movie begins the japanese have clearly been beaten but because of the insane logic of <UNK> they cannot allow themselves to consider surrender at one of many poignant moments the lead character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital since he isn't capable of fighting due to his <UNK> the problem is that the hospital won't accept him so his commander tells him to once again go to the hospital and if they won't accept him he should blow himself up with a <UNK> well this happens just in the first five minutes of the movie a lot worse things <UNK> this soldier and the few because they won't surrender plus there is a case in the movie where a soldier does try to surrender but is <UNK> down this happened a lot later in the war because so often the <UNK> japanese soldiers <UNK> trapped themselves to blow up when they came near in addition the film shows the most vivid depiction of <UNK> and the accompanying madness of any film i have seen in addition <UNK> <UNK> and betrayal all <UNK> this very gritty realistic and <UNK> realistic film you simply couldn't have made a better film of this type horrible but great
<START> the movie goes something like this run around run around someone killed lots of freaking out and then one of the group yells to pull it together or just calm down repeat this as many times as their are characters left in between these things you get to enjoy blank black screen these are not quick but rather several seconds long i kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened yes it does happen more than once if you can believe it br br i notice other mentioned blair witch and it did remind me of that in the way the camera was <UNK> however this movie takes that to the extreme every single time the characters move the camera is <UNK> sometimes so much that you can't make heads or tales as to what you are looking at that brings us to lighting way too dark in some areas i get that they are trying to make us feel like we are in a cave but i'm watching a movie here it would be nice to be able to see br br then there is the ending i actually <UNK> out loud are you kidding me i was watching alone too dumb dumb i think the ending was purely the effort of the people who made this disaster to shock us after so much time of boredom with a so called twist at this point of the movie you could have seen the monster picking his nose and it would be considered a twist truly horrible you have been warned
<START> not entirely sure how i stumbled upon this movie but i'm so glad i did initially we were put off by the fact that it was subtitled but even my <UNK> brother who hates to read especially at the weekend enjoyed this film i found the script fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a dead pan manner only added to the <UNK> of pee on my <UNK> not entirely sure whether it's quite so funny to the native danish as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation i haven't watched many danish films or any for that matter but judging by this film i'm guessing they're not <UNK> by the same political correctness as elsewhere <UNK> bless 'em making the character of a breath of fresh air because let's face it special needs are funny there are so many great one liners in this film it puts american sitcoms to shame
<START> portrayal of fugitive ex felt entirely natural his demeanor his voice his appearance all of it spoke to when he entered a space i as well as characters on the screen could feel he didn't belong there and that his determination to be there spelled trouble br br i read somewhere that mr actually took <UNK> japanese <UNK> training and that would explain his comfort with the <UNK> which showed <UNK> in every if you watch the movies from the moment he draws to the moment he the sword you feel as though you were witnessing something inevitably ugly he'd even spin the <UNK> quickly to flick off the blood before it and it would happen in an <UNK> instant br br <UNK> rendition comes across as a rendition it feels as though he were trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story as a result every time i tried to engage i'd lose my grip because he didn't seem to have a firm grip on the role himself as though it were awkward for him br br the <UNK> in the tv series was entirely old school <UNK> too camera cuts to disguise mr <UNK> with the <UNK> slow action targets sitting still etc extremely bad from a viewer's perspective there was a moment in the episode the castle wall attack when mr <UNK> drew his sword like a child it was embarrassing he handled it as though it were heavy i almost fell off my chair br br and let's be frank the story is about an excellent <UNK> period <UNK> is an issue br br realism isn't however the <UNK> in the movies was excellent and manga like as was intended i'm sure the baby <UNK> was <UNK> with a <UNK> of automatic rapid fire <UNK> by a 3 year old yes manga style it's how the story <UNK> weaves historical cultural accuracy into basically superhero fantasy that makes the movies captivating read <UNK> historical legend i couldn't really sit through the tv series episodes they just felt cheap see the movies first and you'll know what i'm talking about
<START> in short this movie is a <UNK> of artistic <UNK> br br <UNK> is easily the most important european film maker of the 80s and 90s no other living director has shaped the style and <UNK> of present day european cinema more than him it is therefore not easy to say that his latest effort is not just another disappointment after two lackluster films but rather a complete and total disaster <UNK> that he has run out of ideas out of humour and worst of all empathy for the characters he creates br br that is not due to the complexity of the story all <UNK> films are almost impossible to <UNK> this time in fact it's rather easy if you are familiar with his earlier work broken <UNK> is a remake of law of desire only this time the director is straight and the jealous <UNK> lover is a millionaire br br for those of you not familiar with that film i'm doing a summary if you don't want to know too much please skip this paragraph a blind man who used to be a famous movie director <UNK> a sexy <UNK> woman reading a paper to him after a chance street encounter yes really that's how it starts just then he gets a visit by his agent and best friend he mentions to her that he has learned from the paper that a certain millionaire has died which takes the story 14 years back he can still see and is about to direct his next film he stars the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the lead as he is instantly smitten with her the millionaire discovers their affair via silent videos made by his gay son which he has lip <UNK> by an <UNK> a few great scenes <UNK> roth after violent <UNK> the mistress escapes with the director to a <UNK> resort where he learns that the millionaire who produced the film had it released in the worst possible edit destroying the director's reputation the couple decides to return but has an accident in which the director turns blind and the would be actress dies back in the present he learns that his agent has <UNK> the film's <UNK> and starts to <UNK> it br br as in bad education there are various sub plots to <UNK> up this rather thin story and as in bad education the result is more confusing than satisfactory for instance the <UNK> son who works as a dj has an accidental drug <UNK> which is completely unnecessary for the plot and also interpreted rather badly br br mostly however the actors are not to blame but the way their characters are written <UNK> as the agent has so many <UNK> in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from <UNK> is an old man's dream of a protagonist living in an artificial world where an english <UNK> and a few sweet words can seduce any super model and penelope <UNK> is the <UNK> of this old man's sexual fantasy her character is completely lifeless it remains thoroughly incomprehensible why she would go from one old man who at least helped her family to a slightly less old man who isn't charming enough to convince as either a romantic hero or a passion <UNK> br br but all these shortcomings wouldn't make this film so awful however <UNK> does the worst possible thing of a director or any type of <UNK> running out of ideas he quotes himself something he has increasingly done and to very little benefit the film within the film which broken <UNK> uses as a plot driving device is actually women at the verge of a nervous breakdown 1988 only this time it is called chicks and <UNK> this rather unimaginative title may give you a hint how this beloved classic is treated here while the dialog making up the final ten minutes of broken <UNK> is a frantic over the top exchange of screwball one liners in the original film here it is a stern <UNK> <UNK> business encounter br br in conclusion this is the d o a <UNK> of an exhausted creator of past <UNK> pretty much as awful and disappointing as the last indiana jones feature maybe not so many people would agree with that because <UNK> used to be such a genius i'd rather offer my respect to his <UNK> by <UNK> asking the reader to watch all about my mother or tie me up or high heels or <UNK> all of which bear witness to <UNK> unique and <UNK> talent a few more film like this and his legacy may very well be destroyed for good
<START> this movie was the <UNK> and most boring so called horror that i have ever seen i would include a comment on the plot but there was none i do not recommend this movie unless you are prepared for the biggest waste of money and time of your life
<START> set in <UNK> mainly on the <UNK> death in <UNK> is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of <UNK> characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily <UNK> for those who love <UNK> this is a film to <UNK> br br music frequently heard throughout the film <UNK> the drama the mood it creates is not always happy but then what else would you expect with a title like that br br there is not a lot of dialogue in the film rather sparse in fact it's mainly background noises and <UNK> and laughter among the hotel guests the intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of <UNK> between <UNK> von a composer of some <UNK> and a slim teenage youth who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel <UNK> room on the beach and at odd unexpected places around <UNK> they seem to acknowledge each other's presence <UNK> at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and <UNK> <UNK> br br each viewer will have his own interpretation the composer has lost a child of his own is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child he loved is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his <UNK> somewhat <UNK> stare could he be discovering some new inspiration for a yet <UNK> musical masterpiece who knows br br from beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th century <UNK> the <UNK> of the ladies the deck <UNK> on the sand the children <UNK> in their neck to <UNK> bathing costumes the glow of <UNK> and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world while some may think the pace is rather slow at times the film has an overall gentle quality but with a <UNK> <UNK> between two repressed human beings be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending
<START> i first watched this movie back in the mid late 80's when i was a kid we couldn't even get all the way through it the dialog the acting everything about it was just beyond lame br br here are a few examples imagine these spoken real dramatically way over acted you're going to why would anyone want to go to br br nobody ever told us about any br br this movie was so bad my sister and i rented it again for her <UNK> birthday party just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was i don't think we were able to finish it then either
<START> i watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 melbourne international film festival and no one had a good word for it br br i happen to love <UNK> and country music so it's not as if i'm unsympathetic to the subject matter but the problem is that at heart it's a very conservative movie little more than a filmed mills and <UNK> story a <UNK> <UNK> of the most simple minded and <UNK> kind br br it's not just that the love story at its heart that between <UNK> and dr lily is more than a tad unbelievable why any male would be attracted to the <UNK> <UNK> man <UNK> lily is beyond me and frankly mike <UNK> as <UNK> seems to be just going through the motions br br it's simply that the whole movie is too tame and well mannered for its own good there is precious little danger dirt or drama sure there's a moment of excitement involving a school run by <UNK> younger sister but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic it's just so poorly written and acted and the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolved br br as for good old <UNK> now what's wrong with a name like i ask you is the ending of this film believable fitting in with the character this film had earlier constructed i think not
<START> people watch movies for a variety of different reasons this movie didn't have the big budget there's no special effects no car chases and there's no explosions actually reality doesn't have much of these either at least not in my life br br this is a very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos i am not prepared to limit the possibility of since i'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain br br so watch this movie for the characters it is <UNK> full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk br br within the first three minutes <UNK> sutherland <UNK> detective michael life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie excellent acting very believable br br henry <UNK> could not have been cast better and the <UNK> between his and <UNK> <UNK> enhances the of their characters br br i thoroughly enjoyed the <UNK> <UNK> i'm sure she and my mother in law are good friends br br there's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them
<START> a great film every moment masterfully <UNK> by and his crew the actors give credible performances all around the visuals are haunting beautiful and sometimes <UNK> beautiful shots of the japanese country and city landscapes the sounds courtesy of japanese band are never overly edgy as one would expect from band made <UNK> it's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they're on br br all in all they worked everything out perfectly well if they were to give any justice to the story perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted br br the real greatness of 9 souls is the compelling story the prison break movie maybe something of a lost genre these days and road trip movie losing it's appeal due to the way the world is getting smaller but this story easily mixes something fresh to those two genres br br 9 <UNK> are given freedom and possibly the opportunity to regain their places in society will society accept them will they be truly free of their dark <UNK> and can they stick together long enough to stay alive and find out br br each convict has an interesting history their crimes are as varied as their apparent <UNK> a sense of <UNK> among them keeps the story high on drama and supplies it with hilariously comedic situations and due to the nature of their backgrounds violence is always something waiting to happen br br after all that all i can say is go give it a watch
<START> having watched this movie several times i have come to the conclusion that <UNK> <UNK> made a very daring decision to <UNK> a <UNK> for <UNK> when the artist led what most would consider a <UNK> passionate life while the french revolution and the <UNK> era <UNK> across europe surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw while i do understand that mr <UNK> was relating in the <UNK> of the tragedy of life the <UNK> of the world at that time i was left feeling that there was just so much of <UNK> left out so much of his humanity the strongest and most <UNK> point this film made was that because of man's fallen nature each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life each of us has evil within us that we must fight with the help of god how <UNK> when <UNK> says he should have helped more how true for all of us we must defend and protect the innocent the superbly ironic scene in which the once imprisoned priest sentenced to die <UNK> the death sentence on <UNK> who condemned him originally is the stuff of genius i was left wanting something more when the credits rolled maybe less of the unreal <UNK> and more of the inner life of the characters
<START> i know it's hard for you americans to find european films on video dvd particularly from the 80's but please seek out the original version of the <UNK> title <UNK> 1988 and you'll see why the hollywood version of the <UNK> <UNK> up <UNK> particularly at the finale br br i really like sandra <UNK> <UNK> sutherland and particularly jeff bridges but this is just so so lame compared with the original what where they thinking can you imagine seven with a happy ending with gwyneth paltrow running happily into the arms of brad pitt in the finale the whole point the original was such a major international success was because of the shocking finale so why do you accept this kind of remake really avoid this and get the original

to bed at about 10 00 she wound up staying up until 1 30 with us to finish it we were <UNK> i like how the movie starts off at <UNK> funeral right where scarlett left off saying i'll think about it tomorrow scarlett doesn't stay in georgia for long she runs off to <UNK> in her quest to win him back <UNK> is not happy when he finds scarlett in his home so he leaves for the family's plantation

things in this case she is seen by anne <UNK> going up into a hotel room alone with ashley nothing happens but her reputation is <UNK> so scarlett goes to <UNK> with her two <UNK> aunts she soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell <UNK> while in <UNK> she meets many of her o'hara relatives and grows to like one cousin in particular a father she soon gets her divorce notice from <UNK> and then decides she will never tell him about her baby just to spite him typical scarlett br br she decides to go to ireland to make sure <UNK> can never discover

much scarlett has changed and the two finally <UNK> completely and admit they still love each other deeply br br after seeing <UNK> i will say that yes vivian leigh was a better scarlett but i liked the character of scarlett in this film than in the first the reason being that in <UNK> you don't know why you like scarlett she's so cruel to <UNK> and <UNK> and spoiled but you like her lively spirit in scarlett you see how much she has changed oh she is still in the lap of luxury but she's not <UNK> anymore you see how she becomes a true mother to <UNK> and a generous person to the poor people of ireland <UNK> <UNK> does and excellent job at playing this new side of scarlett timothy dalton is not clark gable but at times you swear that you can see original <UNK> in him br br if you just sit back and not compare <UNK> <UNK> and timothy dalton with vivian leigh and clark gable you will most certainly enjoy this movie it's a chance to compare the scarlett of yesterday the one she becomes after tomorrow
<START> it is sad what they are letting into film festivals these days i had to sit through over twenty minutes of this dreary short that wasn't funny at all to get a good seat for a feature film that i wanted to see at a local film festival the festival paired this horrible short with a great feature i am just glad the feature was good otherwise i would have not been a very happy <UNK> br br for a comedy short film it got no laughs the title says it all
<START> i'm not a big musical fan but this is one of the few i really love unlike many other musicals such as the sound of music none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff each song is social commentary <UNK> on war sexuality <UNK> and freedom especially amazing songs are easy to be hard age of <UNK> hair flesh failures 3 5 0 0 walking in space and <UNK> <UNK> totally revolutionary and wonderful i can't wait to someday see it live
<START> a must see br br excellent positive african american love story this movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad more true to life characters looking for love being in love and <UNK> it old story fresh view <UNK> <UNK> was so cary grant in style as the character may have been in a situation but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough almost like a hepburn this is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black man br br this movie is a classic superb acting well written a real love story set in chicago what more can you ask for br br superb black love story br br <UNK> holland
<START> this film is strictly for fans of debbie reynolds and eddie fisher br br i get angry at tcm for showing this mess more frequently than bachelor mother the delightful original i get <UNK> still that some hollywood <UNK> thought it would be a good idea to remake bachelor mother filling it with some lame songs that only serve to <UNK> the flow of a cute comedy instead hollywood could have spent the time money energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original wow what a concept br br bachelor mother the original with ginger rogers and david niven is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with sexuality it is a 1930's <UNK> at the <UNK> office <UNK> of joy the remake with debbie reynolds and eddie fisher is strictly milk and <UNK> it is a 1950's <UNK> with <UNK> br br which cast would you rather watch debbie reynolds eddie fisher and <UNK> <UNK> or ginger rogers david niven and charles coburn for me every member of the cast in the original version is far better than his her counterpart in the remake br br in the original a beautiful young ginger rogers is at her peak david niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled sophisticated and yet <UNK> <UNK> of a wealthy department store <UNK> and i always love to see charles coburn in a movie in bachelor mother he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe br br in <UNK> of joy debbie reynolds is her usual <UNK> self she is fine in this role although her performance along with <UNK> completely changes the tone of the story as an actor eddie fisher is hopeless he is completely lacking in screen presence here he is way too wholesome for this story his acting is completely bland and clueless likewise his singing is so bland and <UNK> that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large the only time he is not completely painful is in <UNK> 8 where incidentally he doesn't sing here <UNK> lame performance alone is enough to ruin this movie <UNK> <UNK> a favorite character actor delivers a competent performance but not one of his best he is more <UNK> than commanding he and fisher are not convincing as a father and son br br do you see a musical for the music the story being merely incidental or do watch a musical for a story with some good music used for <UNK> if the former you might like this lame remake otherwise you are much better off watching the ginger rogers non musical original bachelor mother
<START> this is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever made br br i saw this growing up and it was and is one of my favorites maybe not as popular as fast times but just as great br br there is a serious side to this movie as mentioned by other reviewers it starts as a comedy and <UNK> into a drama about halfway through that's the beauty of it though and what sets it apart you get it all humor not unlike that of fast times drama and a great great soundtrack br br i personally think every kid about to enter high school should see this it would give an idea about the journey their about to <UNK> on <UNK> what kid watching this wouldn't be able to relate to someone in the movie the fact that it becomes so serious halfway though is also cool and just superbly well done you don't even see it coming definitely a lot of surprises br br spoilers don't read anymore if you don't want to know br br great <UNK> humor who could forget the scene between gary and <UNK> i can still hear it oh my big strong <UNK> priceless br br some of the scenes between gary and <UNK> are hard to watch particularly the final scene of coarse there are so so many women like karen out there who would have made the exact same choice she did think about it how many women reject men with hearts of gold like gary for <UNK> i know i've done it and so have many females i know this movie will inspire discussion and despite the countless times i've seen it still leaves me filled with admiration for the film makers and performers everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what's more likely more then one person br br lastly the music used is just great a lot of cars <UNK> lots of obscure now songs from the 80's an 80's <UNK> dream br br but make no mistake it is not the music that makes this movie unique it is the story itself plain and simple one of the best of it's kind and a teen movie classic
<START> bela lugosi as god <UNK> discussed in a movie in the straight laced 1950s by <UNK> this must be an ed wood film br br watching this movie i felt a combination of guilt pleasure and <UNK> all at the same time the story is about <UNK> ed wood himself and his cross dressing alter ego glenda somehow if this movie were made now i could see kevin kline playing <UNK> glenda notice how all the cross alter <UNK> are versions of their male name <UNK> glenda robert <UNK> etc it attempts to <UNK> portray it as the mental disorder that it is rather than as a graphic <UNK> br br somehow wood manages to sneak in bondage and s m sequences into his initial story of <UNK> glenda along with these <UNK> scenes satan himself shows up obviously having a bad hair day the dialog and pace are nonexistent but the film is enjoyable in its context the weird world of ed wood br br <UNK> says put on your favorite <UNK> <UNK> for this one
<START> 10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic <UNK> as the inspiration and music i'll do each one <UNK> br br nicolas <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> music a story about an assassination attempt in 1931 vienna <UNK> russell <UNK> wife plays a man not bad very beautiful and exotic russell is great br br charles <UNK> no story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music br br jean luc godard jean <UNK> horrendous pointless boring no plot no nothing filled with gratuitous female nudity the worst br br <UNK> temple <UNK> buck henry beverly <UNK> and anita morris star in this funny if obvious story about a cheating couple pretty good br br bruce <UNK> <UNK> short lush and romantic very good br br robert altman jean <UNK> dull a <UNK> br br <UNK> richard wagner this has bridget fonda in her film debut beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene br br ken russell <UNK> really strange but ok br br derek <UNK> <UNK> lyrical look at youth and old age very sweet br br the last is by bill <UNK> doing i he has john hurt dressed as a clown lip <UNK> to caruso br br when this came out it almost got an x rating for the <UNK> nudity and the sex scene it was given an r with a strict warning attached saying the r rating would be heavily <UNK> after the film bombed that warning disappeared br br the idea isn't bad and 6 out of the 10 segments were worthwhile worth seeing even if you don't like opera just avoid the godard segment i'm giving it an 8
<START> this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in 1971 the episode starred sue <UNK> of <UNK> movie fame and joseph <UNK> who play a baby <UNK> and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby <UNK> to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby <UNK> is totally oblivious to the <UNK> appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally she <UNK> out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i don't know what purpose it was to make such an <UNK> episode that lasted just 5 minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and <UNK> this one a total wasted effort
<START> this is an adaptation of an edith <UNK> work whose writing is amazing sadly this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century <UNK> and desperation work depicts ward and dalton aren't so bad but alicia wooden performance made me <UNK> she was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story but she stood like a stick the whole movie long and i never believed a word out of her mouth when she asks ward why can't i move you near the end of the film i couldn't help but answer that's what i've been wondering for the last hour and a half
<START> in thailand the americans connor colin and his girlfriend amanda meredith monroe <UNK> in a <UNK> fight and amanda leaves connor alone she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger indeed the mean vampire don <UNK> and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in <UNK> connor joins to a clan of good vampires <UNK> by sang stephanie <UNK> trying to save amanda from the <UNK> of br br i expected that vampires the turning were a good movie the locations and the cinematography are beautiful the very heavy music score is excellent stephanie <UNK> is gorgeous and attractive but unfortunately the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts the story is very short and the unknown marty <UNK> uses long scenes with motorcycle race fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film my vote is four br br title brazil <UNK> a vampires the <UNK>
<START> have you ever read a book then seen the movie and wonder how did they screw it up so bad this is one of those the book by nobody likes a drunken indian was great <UNK> funny this movie is not it seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we cared about the characters this movie which touches on some real concerns about indians makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust or slavery not well done
<START> for some unknown reason 7 years ago i watched this movie with my mother and sister i don't think i've ever laughed as hard with them before this movie was <UNK> bad how sequels were produced is beyond me its been awhile since i last saw this movie but the one impression that it has stuck with me over the years has been they must have found the script in a <UNK> in the <UNK> of a cheap movie studio made into a movie and decided that it didn't suck enough and made it worse i'm pretty sure that they spent all the budget on camera work and the so called special effects and then had 13 cents left toward the script and to pay the actors
<START> as a lesbian i am sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and on tv as a sad person forever <UNK> between suicide and homicide but never destined to find happiness br br if like me you are fed up with hollywood's anti lesbian propaganda you'll breathe a sigh of relief at this delightful offering from the bbc <UNK> is the daughter of an <UNK> house <UNK> who wonders why she can't feel the way she should about freddy one of the local <UNK> who has his eye set on her she falls  and falls hard  for kitty butler a male <UNK> with a visiting theatre <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kitty to london as her br br not everything that happens to <UNK> is pleasant in this story and some of the things she does are not <UNK> clean either but she will win your heart and her story of love <UNK> will leave you with a beautiful <UNK> in your throat at the end br br if you are a <UNK> hating macho man or a <UNK> housewife or some brand of religious <UNK> who believes that <UNK> should die and go to hell this series is not for you but if you have a heart and you believe in love you will cry at the end as much as i did
<START> i loved flash gordon as a child and watching the series again on dvd brings back such fond memories each 15 minute episode features the adventures of our hero flash the lovely <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> dr on the planet with flash escaping death at every turn the shark men nearly <UNK> him he faces the fire monster in the tunnel of terror and he's in mortal peril in the static room br br the characters are still fun buster <UNK> is every bit the blonde <UNK> hero and jean rogers is a delicate and beautiful <UNK> <UNK> princess aura still plots to steal flash for herself king of the <UNK> men still has his <UNK> laugh and angel wings and <UNK> the <UNK> emperor of the universe is still giving everyone the evil eye and the creeps br br this serial probably wouldn't interest children today with its hokey effects oh that spaceship but it's a fun bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time around the actors play it straight and don't play down to kids i appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter <UNK> which had pretty big words in them br br i'm glad this came out on dvd it's a lot of fun to <UNK> this classic sci fi serial
<START> first off i can remember vaguely being told this story in primary school about 6 or 7 years ago so i am sort of familiar with the story br br a lot of that has changed however and there are many differences and mistakes sometimes unnecessary in the film that die hard fans will not appreciate br br however as a whole i really love this film i first saw it near christmas about 2 years ago well the 1st part then caught the whole thing again last christmas probably on the same channel br br i was very impressed at times it may be a bit <UNK> and long but with an engaging story decent acting especially from <UNK> fonda and <UNK> and beautiful scenery costume and little touches of magic make this a really special film which for me really reminds me of christmas br br despite differences from the book i think the film does well to <UNK> new themes and ideas the seasons with <UNK> winter etc with i think a new thief character to represent <UNK> throughout the imagery once you notice is quite startling and brilliantly executed br br i live in the uk so have waited a long time for the dvd and luckily enough i saw an <UNK> showing a series of free dvd's being offered in the daily mail newspaper which i don't normally get so i got <UNK> issue and finally have my dvd if you missed it and want this rare dvd for region 2 i suggest you collect the <UNK> from the daily mail and send them off as your dvd will then be delivered by christmas br br so for a bit of escape into the christmas season this year put on your fire get <UNK> and watch this as you and kids probably will really enjoy this great film if you don't have it it will probably be repeated on channel 4 this christmas so record it
<START> i wish i could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it <UNK> but i can't another species could have come and mutated while i waited for some action for such a controversial man <UNK> lived the most conventional life if you didn't know about the mad theories you could almost mistake him for a <UNK> collector br br the film makers have cast <UNK> as a <UNK> which does him a <UNK> even when he briefly loses his mind due to his <UNK> it wasn't interesting to watch maybe great <UNK> are dull people i don't know what i was expecting a <UNK> <UNK> eccentric with wild hair and eyes <UNK> his love of all things <UNK> the <UNK> of madness <UNK> from a <UNK> brow a long haired <UNK> who to animals a head <UNK> lunatic with eyes lit up like of truth all of the above would have been great this is the movies for <UNK> sake br br but there was none of that no lightning no thunder no wonder no awe just paul <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> fresh from the subtle as breath school of method acting i imagine that someone with <UNK> ideas had a brain like a <UNK> train so why did this film just along <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like a slow winter the disappointment is <UNK>
<START> i find it amazing that so many people probably <UNK> have voted for this movie giving it such <UNK> mostly <UNK> ok the movie was fine funny but it was nothing special on the other hand the only good thing about is the dialogues rather not <UNK> for non <UNK> screenplay is primitive the acting except for <UNK> <UNK> as awful it's too much <UNK> about nothing fortunately it's not included in the top 250 p s the sequel 2 2 is on the way and it's just the same story
<START> this movie was much better than i expected jean peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights to the extent she may have a double doing the action it's hard to tell but peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it and doing it well with a good and serious script this could have been an excellent film but it's basically cheesy still entertaining however not up to a regular jacques <UNK> film but definitely above a regular jean peters film color is typical of this <UNK> time period ie too <UNK> and not realistic the actors for and her first mate and the drunken doctor were good louis jordan was a bit weak i don't think debra <UNK> was right either but certainly jean peters and debra <UNK> were probably the two best looking female stars in the <UNK>
<START> we'll never see this movie broadcast by hbo in the near future if at all if anyone somehow comes across it in a video store just grab it before someone else does because i doubt if it ever will be re released again br br an unbelievable and <UNK> movie about the first attack on the world trade center on <UNK> 26 1993 and how the government <UNK> who's job it is to identify and stop terrorists from doing harm and damage to american citizens and american property completely fell down on the job and <UNK> allowed it to happen br br bone chilling since we all know now that the terrorists who were <UNK> at the end of the movie weren't going to be the end of our nightmare that <UNK> on september 11 2001 br br the film brought out everything that went wrong back in 1992 <UNK> that allowed that first tragedy at the <UNK> to happen still it took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from that first <UNK> attack to be more <UNK> and ready to prevent the second and far more devastating assault on the world trade center to happen i found this movie harder to watch after the events of 9 11 then the video of the attacks of 9 11 themselves br br all i can say about this film is don't watch it alone the very ending itself is so powerful as well as <UNK> that it would leave you in a state of shock in knowing what we know today and possibly in need to have someone who's with you but not watching the movie to call for medical attention
<START> starring <UNK> <UNK> rob schneider lauren holly rip torn this movie is a classic family favorite at least for most members of my family that is one of us rolls our eyes at the mention of this movie and thinks what a stupid movie i'm not that person though i still find this movie highly amusing i just watched it again last night with someone who had never seen it and i laughed just as hard as the first time i watched it it's still very funny to me br br naval captain tom dodge <UNK> is a bit of a black sheep in the navy he's the kind of guy who will play golf while on a sub cracking a ball onto a golf course while they <UNK> past it he's the kind of guy who will get drunk pass out and wake up with a <UNK> and a <UNK> on his he's not the kind of guy that everybody wants to be commanding a sub br br but dodge is at the end of the line he's put in <UNK> to get command of his own sub several times and if he doesn't get a sub this time he's headed for a desk job meaning that's it for naval life the <UNK> decide to give him his own boat but they don't give him a new nuclear sub they give him a <UNK> sub an ancient <UNK> from world war ii his mission is to clean her up and take her out on the atlantic for a war game br br dodge is obviously a little bit frustrated to have such a crappy boat given to him when he's worked so hard to get to the point that he's at so he goes and talks to <UNK> <UNK> torn about it <UNK> explains the purpose of the war game <UNK> <UNK> are still being sold out there in the real world to countries like iran iraq and <UNK> to name a few <UNK> wants to know what would happen if some <UNK> captain in a <UNK> sub came to the states and tried to <UNK> a nuclear <UNK> into one of the <UNK> would they make it dodge and most of the <UNK> don't think so but <UNK> wants to know for sure hence why he has <UNK> this war game mission is to take the <UNK> out to sea then try to <UNK> the u s nuclear navy and blow up the american naval <UNK> in <UNK> battle of course br br so that's about as deep as the plot gets this is not a plot driven movie it's a stupid movie that is just a big gag it makes fun of itself and you are not expected to take it seriously if you're looking for good dumb laughs on a friday night i'd urge you to check it out br br bottom line 3 out of 4 worth a look
<START> secret service agent jay charles bronson has been assigned to protect the president wife the new first lady jill ireland she is a very difficult woman and has his hands full she is the victim of numerous assassination attempts all directed by the <UNK> chief of staff who wants the first lady dead this movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line but also with the lack of realistic locations for example in the scene depicting the <UNK> parade the first lady is in a rolls <UNK> <UNK> with agent and without the president also we know what washington <UNK> is like weather wise in january and not only is everybody top coat less you can even see some palm trees in the 70 degree and sunny weather obviously filmed in hollywood not washington <UNK> this movie is a joke it is not worth your time
<START> i guess if they are not brother this film will became very common how long were they can keep this if we were part what should they do so natural feelings so plain and <UNK> words but i almost cried last night blood relationship <UNK> love <UNK> film in another word the elder brother is very cute if they are not brothers they won't have so many forbidden the hearts of their own at the very beginning the elder brother is <UNK> of whether he is coming out or not at the beginning maybe the little brother being so long time with his brother and even can't got any praise from his made him very upset and even sad maybe this is a key <UNK> <UNK> let him feel there were no one in the world loving him except his beloved brother and i want to say this is a so human natural feeling there is nothing to be <UNK> you may fell in love your just a <UNK> heart looking for <UNK> to rely on
<START> i just want to say that i was thrilled to find these comments about the show i have tried online <UNK> for info about the show in the past with no luck i loved the show i have a hard time getting motivated to exercise but this show made it fun as another comment mentioned that it wasn't so complicated as the routines nowadays it was an ideal <UNK> that got the job done i would give anything to be able to buy a copy of just one <UNK> i remember many of the moves but not nearly all of it somebody please try to get it back on the air and also make it available on dvd it is so great to know i wasn't the only one that loved that show thanks for making my day
<START> i have been an avid <UNK> fan since the late 70's early 80's when this movie came out it was a must to see it and after seeing it i went right over and bought it the movie is great i love the animated action it brings and the music is great yes i bought the soundtrack on cd a recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy
<START> two young friends grow up together in afghanistan the events of their lives drive them apart and one of them has now been living in the usa for a good number of years as he receives a phone call it is clear that he has to return for there is trouble in the air br br this is a film about life lasting friendships mistakes and making up again but also a film about darkness pain and <UNK> from the <UNK> young days of growing up and playing games to the falling apart back to the playing of games this is a slow film but not too slow br br it plays on emotions and that is quite right for a drama but it does so a bit too much for my liking this makes it too much of a <UNK> <UNK> it a bit of the quality it carries it is still good but not fantastic br br 7 out of 10 <UNK> ran
<START> by strange coincidence i've started to watch this move straight after <UNK> de nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than <UNK> de nice so i was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop br br unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> again left me disappointed i don't know maybe it's just problem with <UNK> but since diner de cons i haven't seen any french comedy that i would call really good even when i look at the reviews on imdb only people from france are giving the <UNK> <UNK> high notes br br for me this movie didn't really work in some parts is as funny as real bond movies in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny
<START> without question film is a powerful medium more so now than ever before due to the <UNK> of dvd video which gives the filmmaker the added <UNK> that his story or message is going to be seen by possibly millions of people use of this medium therefore <UNK> an <UNK> responsibility to the artist <UNK> as film can be educational as well as entertaining which <UNK> that certain subjects should be approached <UNK> and with a <UNK> sensitivity and sensibility a film like spielberg's <UNK> list ' for example is important in that it keeps alive the memory of that which must not be forgotten and as history tends to repeat itself spielberg's film can be viewed as a valuable tool in <UNK> a of that tragedy in that same vein this film focus ' directed by <UNK> is important in it <UNK> the <UNK> reality of anti <UNK> which for years beyond number has affected millions of people is still <UNK> prevalent today and like any <UNK> of <UNK> will <UNK> itself if left <UNK> or ignored born of a <UNK> strain it's a disease <UNK> society which could be <UNK> and with it's <UNK> insights into the condition this film is an effective <UNK> that just may at the very least help <UNK> the <UNK> of it and hopefully may act as a step toward <UNK> it altogether br br lawrence newman william h macy served his country in the great war and has since lived a quiet conventional life in new york he's had the same job as a <UNK> director for some twenty years and owns the house located in an average middle class neighborhood in which he lives with his mother kay <UNK> lawrence is the kind of guy who gets by just fine by <UNK> his own business and <UNK> to involve himself with matters that are not he feels his concern br br all of that is about to change however as with the <UNK> of world war 2 lawrence along with the owner of the corner market mr david <UNK> inexplicably finds himself a target of the neighborhood who have <UNK> themselves with the union <UNK> ' a national organization currently taken to <UNK> their fears and hatred upon jews or anyone who even <UNK> like a jew and suddenly lawrence finds that he can no longer just stand on the <UNK> and watch the game being played because now he is the game whether he wants to be or not br br working from an intelligent well written screenplay by which he adapted from arthur <UNK> novel presents a chilling scenario that <UNK> <UNK> the effects of <UNK> upon those against whom it is <UNK> and when one considers the fact that this is not merely a <UNK> situation but a depiction of reality it becomes all the more <UNK> even unnerving and what makes the film so effective is obvious grasp of his subject and his studied presentation which is thought provoking in it's subtlety in the opening scene <UNK> <UNK> character ' and very soon afterward <UNK> it in another scene which <UNK> the audience the opportunity to observe and <UNK> how <UNK> mind actually works the thought <UNK> that direct his life with that in place then is able to take his audience along with lawrence as his problems gradually begin to unfold by so doing he effectively illustrates how the problem <UNK> rather than merely stating the problem and addressing it head on which <UNK> the viewers emotional involvement and ultimately enhances the impact of the film br br makes an important statement with this film which is not only an <UNK> of <UNK> but carries a <UNK> message about <UNK> as well and to his credit he never hits you over the head with it or <UNK> in <UNK> finger pointing to make his case instead he proceeds carefully taking great pains to be as objective as possible with all that he is <UNK> for your consideration his approach is that of a cinematic <UNK> and it's an approach that serves and his film quite well br br as lawrence william h macy one of the best character actors in the business gives an amazing performance establishing the credibility and believability of his character with a sensitive honest and <UNK> portrayal he never attempts to <UNK> the personal flaws of <UNK> nature but uses them instead to create a character that is decidedly three dimensional which not only makes him convincing but serves to <UNK> the integrity of the portrayal what makes it so compelling is <UNK> ability to convey the process by which he <UNK> his own conscience which successfully <UNK> the viewer to share in the experience of his personal <UNK> in the final analysis it's the strength of <UNK> performance more than anything else that makes this film so significantly distinct br br another of the film's strengths is the performance turned in by laura dern as <UNK> hart a portrayal that effectively <UNK> <UNK> work as well as that of dern lends tremendous substance to her character capturing her physically as well as emotionally and her colorful <UNK> <UNK> a striking contrast to <UNK> <UNK> that works extremely well for her character as well as the film itself br br and just as sean combs recently in <UNK> <UNK> made a good case against <UNK> out of hand the acting <UNK> of an established rock star ' meat <UNK> gives a powerful performance here as fred <UNK> next door neighbor it demonstrates too that a true artist will produce regardless of the kind of <UNK> he's given to work with br br the supporting cast includes michael <UNK> kenneth <UNK> father <UNK> joseph <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> meadows mrs <UNK> the kind of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft focus ' offers a memorable experience that hopefully will prove to be <UNK> as well to those unaware that such conditions have existed and still do even in this the land of the free 10 10 br br br br
<START> read the book forget the movie
<START> the idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie especially because it's meant to be funny and i guess heart warming in some weird way the problem is the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross it was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them there was just no payoff also the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that it's impossible to believe they wouldn't have been caught almost immediately especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen <UNK> for days on end and as far as being gross goes i just didn't need to see scene after scene after scene of guys <UNK> along the side of the road plus believe it or not there is a scene where four of the guys are out <UNK> sheep br br all in all i really hated this movie and it's a shame as i almost always love japanese films just not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one
<START> i think i can safely say without really giving anything away that this movie had no robots in it the guys in robot costumes didn't act or speak as such and the evil <UNK> behind the whole plot isn't a robot either br br the whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a <UNK> set i can't even use words to describe the acting br br this couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of star crystal in short it is clearly one of the worst sci fi movies of the 80's and i would be so bold as to say of all time
<START> the bbc <UNK> themselves with the boundaries they crossed with <UNK> the <UNK> in the past they've been <UNK> with dennis <UNK> works but this mini series as it was screened in the uk is superb andrew davies work is top notch i've not read the sarah <UNK> novel but i can imagine he's done it real justice i comment on the most men have watched it for that proved to be a main talking and selling point when originally advertised the fact is it the lesbian side of society in the <UNK> a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys well it was <UNK> took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doors br br you can also look at <UNK> the <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> it actually is as well as <UNK> that many gay <UNK> and straight people go through and comments on this occur and repeat all the time br br if you've not seen it yet either repeated on tv or on dvd get it you'll be in for a treat and even the production and filming of it is perfect just try to hide your in parts like i said is the order of the day and beware a or two br br enjoy
<START> cult <UNK> are <UNK> familiar with the term video <UNK> this was a notorious british list containing all the films that could bring to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences <UNK> for gore buffs this is an excellent <UNK> as it contains <UNK> cruel and <UNK> <UNK> movies faces of death cannibal holocaust <UNK> killer as well as outrageous and ultra sick horror films the burning nightmare city the <UNK> murders keeping this in mind it's quite unusual to see night of the bloody apes listed among the other <UNK> it sure is the blood and violence are so poorly presented i can't imagine anyone would be offended by it and the silly plot about a desperate doctor <UNK> a <UNK> heart into the chest of his dying son isn't exactly what you would call <UNK> real neither all that remains is a fairly amusing pulp horror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze the man ape make up effects are laughable and there's no tension or atmosphere to <UNK> anywhere enjoyable only if you're in the right mood in other words the few sequences showing detailed matches of lady wrestling which one of the lead actresses does for a living are very cool
<START> alright the first time i seen talk radio was in a video store for only 2 00 on vhs believe it or not and i looked at it and i thought it might be about howard stern because i just looked at it for about thirty seconds then just didn't see it again then i went to another store about a month later and i found talk radio on dvd for only 5 00 so i see it was directed by oliver stone and i picked it up so after the film was over i was speechless i have never seen such a film like this here's the main plot then i'll tell ya what i thought of it br br it is about a dallas talk radio host barry a jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and he and is taking everything seriously now a network wants to put his show live everywhere in the u s so <UNK> show gets a lot of interesting phone <UNK> like <UNK> a neo kent a rock n roll drugged kid john rapist and others now some of the <UNK> sound like the same actor actresses but still i think it fits okay br br now what i love a lot about this film is the dark <UNK> and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station the dark music in the background fits very nicely too it has a flashback scene in the film also how he started with radio which i think they did good on br br but the great thing about the film is ending i was surprised by it and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone <UNK> off the air and everything about it is wonderful it also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like dallas one of oliver <UNK> underrated weakest films mentioned but i think it's his best in my opinion br br but definitely get this film if you like films with paranoia feel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background i still watch this film a lot of the times now when i'm bored as matter fact i watched it tonight yeah if ya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film watch it at with the lights off i may sound crazy but it makes the film better br br another thing i forgot to mention is that the reason i don't think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title radio ' it doesn't sound very <UNK> or anything it's kind of plain a better title like the book talked to death or maybe the abusive radio host or something catchy and not plain talk radio or maybe because of universal pictures oliver stone usually didn't do universal i don't think paramount might have been a good company i don't know something about this film didn't do so well but i love it br br sticks and stones can break your bones but words can cause permanent damage
<START> this film could have been a decent re make and gosh knows it tried or ms english tried <UNK> talented actors together with a successful experienced writer director should be a formula for a decent film but ms <UNK> experience according to her imdb bio is exclusively limited to television work and it is <UNK> obvious throughout this film br br i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television to give some credit to ms english many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv and maybe a laugh track would have helped so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini series or a sit com i think it could have worked but this is cinema and sadly ms <UNK> talents didn't translate i <UNK> at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half <UNK> meg ryan is her usual <UNK> cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent she has made films where she doesn't recreate her <UNK> <UNK> role and done them well but not here <UNK> <UNK> seemed to simply go through the motions such a great talent and yet such a poor performance i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see what worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the <UNK> and no one helped ms english get the changes <UNK> or subtleties right if only she as writer director and producer had reached out for some assistance i think it could have been good but it was not br br it's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time money this new <UNK> cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate a few movie <UNK> are having a meeting the <UNK> reads let's remake a classic with worse everything
<START> for the record the 1949 version of the blue <UNK> is not the original film as many have stated br br this story was filmed in great britain in <UNK> just after the novel was written as much as i'd love to see the 1949 version i'd thoroughly enjoy an opportunity at seeing the true original release of this story on film br br granted the 1980 film with christopher <UNK> brooke <UNK> and the two youngsters was filmed with beautiful cinematography the acting didn't seem all that great when i first viewed this film but after having viewed this a few times it becomes obvious that two children growing up on an island without adult <UNK> would indeed have a simplistic way of approaching life whether it be in their language appearance or daily activities br br although some have been fortunate enough to view the 1949 blue <UNK> i cannot help but wonder if there is anyone living who can remember the <UNK> release of this story to film
<START> among the many <UNK> here for this production there was one individual whose comments asked if he she were the only one who wasn't that enthralled by it i e giving this film 3 stars however the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story and other production of same well this person isn't the only one who didn't like this production include me but there i part company even with him her if you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again i'd watch it certainly but i'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it i'd much prefer being locked into <UNK> <UNK> or having to watch paint dry on a wall though further i wouldn't want to see this story again anytime anywhere or in any alternative presentation sometimes you feel like comedian george pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a <UNK> and this is one of those for me i liked angela lansbury in a favorite movie of mine long hot summer and while not a huge fan of the show enjoyed murder she wrote but here i not only didn't care for the story or other aspects but i found <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> singing and everything else about her over the top performance perhaps the most annoying presence in any movie or presentation in any other media i've ever experienced it was like an <UNK> <UNK> of audrey <UNK> equally over the top cockney at rex harrison in the earlier portions of my fair lady but that was incident to the plot presented for light comedic effect and mercifully brief this was anything but brief and to me seemed as if it had gone on for about 10 hours <UNK> <UNK> explanation of <UNK> at work if i hadn't been with friends with the necessity to remain my viewing would have been brief i laughed though at the seinfeld episode where <UNK> <UNK> everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked the english patient my friends somewhat regarded me the same way when i interrupted their <UNK> over this movie give me some dragging <UNK> <UNK> over a <UNK> board anytime instead
<START> and boy is the <UNK> <UNK> a female <UNK> is taken over by the spirit of a recently deceased ninja <UNK> down to her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> juice on her body so her boyfriend can <UNK> it off performs a seductive dance then goes off to kill the policemen who killed the ninja she's possessed by only to be hunted down by a one eyed ninja master just like in real life eh <UNK> only by sho <UNK> martial arts choreography and his <UNK> to put his obnoxious kids in this one you really have to see this to believe it it's the ultimate mix of totally at odds genres
<START> i was totally disgusted with this unnecessary sequel to the <UNK> adventure a movie which i have given a great comment about br br this film is unbelievable from the word go i agree why were no other <UNK> <UNK> around and <UNK> the one that rescued the original survivors had just <UNK> over the boat that michael caine sally field are on that was the only rescue crew hard to believe br br the acting is generally poor and the show looks cheap i really hated the waste of talent from some good actors br br don't watch this film unless you must catch sally michael as lovers br br
<START> from today's point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 or x in the us the film has a sexual yet sublime erotic story to tell but the pictures are rather innocent throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in the fashion the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting and this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing
<START> house of dracula isn't all that bad of a film and is rather decent at times br br spoilers br br arriving at the home of dr <UNK> <UNK> stevens in his <UNK> home count dracula john carradine <UNK> seeks a cure for <UNK> he starts work on a potential cure involving blood <UNK> the wolf man lawrence <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr arrives at his estate looking for a cure to <UNK> working with the two patients he discovers a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory and after searching the area he finds the frankenstein monster glenn strange buried nearby becoming obsessed with <UNK> it dr keeps <UNK> dracula and <UNK> <UNK> and after demanding that they get their treatment instead of him working on the monster they turn on each other in a climactic showdown br br the good news this was a rather decent film there is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative this is the first film to openly <UNK> the idea of <UNK> as a blood disease and one that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of <UNK> fluid something that would be taken up by later genre works but rarely as directly as this there's even a <UNK> slide of the <UNK> that is believed responsible for the condition it works in some rather nicely used ideas and comes across as a rather nifty idea even if some of the execution is a little stale the fact that each of the creatures has at least one standout scene is a nicely done idea the wolf man has a marvelous scene where he transforms inside a prison cell to the <UNK> members of the search party and goes crazy <UNK> initial appearance of appearing as a bat and flying toward a prone figure sleeping and then appearing in human form looks really impressive the monster rampage is well handled and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused the large bat that dracula transforms into always looks decent for once and is quite realistically done it's a thoroughly decent affair br br the bad news there are several things that weren't all that great about this one the fact that the film combines so much potentially <UNK> plots and ideas that it really doesn't know what to do with them there are several different back stories that have to be <UNK> together and which should be clear enough to mix well together and seem coherent this really doesn't have any of that the plot is rather flimsy and doesn't really give a treatment to any of the stars and instead concentrates on one then another and then includes all three in the ending the monsters only seem to get engaged with each other for the smallest possible reason makes it a big distraction the ending is for once a big let down and seems entirely like it was changed at the last minute there's a few other small things that weren't all that spectacular and pretty much also contribute to this br br the final verdict it's quite a decent film and manages to get through most of the time with an entertaining style nowhere near the classic status of each <UNK> debut features but it's a nice enough watch for fans of the monsters and of universal films in general br br today's rating pg violence
<START> i am biased because i appear in this film but i loved it and i am only in about seven <UNK> minutes and am not nearly the most interesting part of it the film is an honest and intriguing account of a noble independent group of filmmakers trying to make a lovable movie it is also an account of <UNK> expectations and fallen <UNK> the interviews are well <UNK> together in the editing the different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of one person also the interviews are shot in a pretty interesting fashion keeping the film visually satisfying definitely a worthwhile film i hope it gets around
<START> this is a cute little movie that provides pretty much what it promises some good entertainment after all when a movie <UNK> it features top <UNK> <UNK> you have to figure that it is not a likely candidate for the best picture oscar those guys are <UNK> not actors your next clue is that the movie doesn't star nicholas cage or jennifer aniston i e you shouldn't expect to see the current <UNK> names it was meant to be just plain old entertainment and in that regard it is every bit as good as a lot of the old <UNK> i have seen through the years br br so what do you get with hell to pay you get 100 minutes of good old entertainment you get a chance to see some stars from past years who act pretty much like what they did in their prime but a little older you get to see some good <UNK> <UNK> in major roles and a few <UNK> <UNK> in the background it was a lot of fun for me seeing people that i have shot with visited in their homes and who are my good friends get to do something that a lot of people only ever dream about they're in a real live honest to gosh movie they're doing something a lot of wannabe actors and wannabe <UNK> will never get the chance to do and i think that alone makes it worth the watch br br admittedly not everyone is a <UNK> member and so i saw lots of fun and humor that others may miss but it is still good old fashioned entertainment and frankly there are a lot of movies in the theatre right now that i wouldn't give a <UNK> to see so save the money to go see <UNK> mountain get hell to pay and watch some real <UNK> have some fun
<START> this version is very painful to watch all of the acting is very stilted but especially that of norma <UNK> who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a <UNK> check out the <UNK> version with joan crawford robert <UNK> and william powell which is much more entertaining
<START> i thought it was going to be a lousy movie honestly i mean rupert ron acting in a movie different from harry potter was actually really difficult to picture it but as the movie started it showed that this guy does have talent i mean is the best actor of the <UNK> trio for reference have you seen emma watson trying to act or what about <UNK> acting both lack experience even though they have acted in a million harry potter movies ben his character is a very shy boy incapable of showing his true feelings about everything his despise about his over <UNK> mom and the <UNK> anger towards his father who is unable to step up and confront his <UNK> wife julie <UNK> was absolutely brilliant her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past while she tries to remember <UNK> is absolutely wonderful also it appears that many youth is wasted in religious nonsense acts
<START> i absolutely love this movie i just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday this movie brings up several questions one is who are the monsters of this world to be different is just that different the real monsters hide behind masks of <UNK> they are those that everyone considers a nice quiet bloke who didn't bother anybody or they are worse they are the characters such as played by men who draw pleasure and power from <UNK> up people and creating their own books of blood i love the <UNK> people with gifts and those that may be for people to look upon this movie touches on and explores what is normal who are <UNK> and what fear does to some even though i gave this movie 10 i am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed <UNK> my other complaint was why didn't they ever make a second film i for one would have loved to see a <UNK> of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end
<START> a poor basketball movie a gruff coach with a dubious background comes to a small indiana high school basketball team in the 1950's and <UNK> the boys to victory by breaking them down first and then building them up br br not a bad subject photography ok but the plot is totally predictable no real sub plots nothing added to make the movie exciting you know what is going to happen from the very beginning suitable for 4th <UNK>
<START> i've seen all 3 now i just can't believe how bad <UNK> is not in comparison to the others but simply on it's own merit or lack of br br i can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10 i gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10 they were thought provoking and beautifully done i gave this movie a rating of 1 if a 0 or negative number was available i would have given it that rating instead what a total waste of time it was watching this movie i thought after the first 30 minutes that i should turn it off but then i figured that it was just a very slow starting movie i thought the same thing after 45 minutes then 1 hour etc then i realized that it wasn't going to get any better br br it's very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities don't take my word for it watch it yourself be sure to see the first two movies before this one if you see this one first i can just about guarantee that you'll never want to see the first two but they are definitely much much better than this piece of work br br the best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end that's when your <UNK> on this earth is complete and you can <UNK> minutes in <UNK> for the suffering that you've endured watching this film if god is <UNK> <UNK> he'll be more generous
<START> i often wonder how movies like this even get made and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them br br with it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along adding twists and turns when he liked no matter how ludicrous they were the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as jo <UNK> roy <UNK> fashion <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> yeah right br br every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped acting was awful <UNK> for and awful suits for a <UNK> <UNK> locales the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion screenplay etc etc just one word rubbish br br for those people who love <UNK> and his movies watch it as for me i'll never get those two and a half hours back the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent
<START> <UNK> blows all the female cast members out of the water including the official love interest <UNK> <UNK> br br i would have loved to see this movie play out as power trip <UNK> is simply <UNK> whenever she is on the screen she does sensual beautiful and menacing to the power of 10 watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold br br lena <UNK> is cast in the <UNK> role of the older woman which is hugely <UNK> she looks fantastic and at <UNK> according to the imdb still looks stunning br br the story unfortunately is very limited plot wise we've seen it all before etc br br the most heart wrenching is death scene especially keeping in mind what happened to <UNK> after filming br br all in all a remarkable vampire movie
<START> i saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel they had advertised it as an awful movie and so i was drawn to see it and i was not let down br br a group of 18 19 year old go to an <UNK> site at an old <UNK> castle in <UNK> to try to <UNK> the myth of the <UNK> <UNK> strange things happens something is in the forest and people start disappearing br br the main thing about this movie that really bothers me is that the story is supposed to take place in <UNK> where i happen to live there were so many places in the movie where the hollywood style <UNK> danish reality it really made the acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyes br br you never see the characters interact with any of their surroundings its feels like a mini hollywood in <UNK> and it takes away the credibility of the movie when at one point you hear someone speak old danish it sounds exactly like modern day swedish really bad research considering the director is from <UNK> br br the characters in the movie used <UNK> and <UNK> and that's really funny since <UNK> is about the size of your backyard where you are there is never more than 50 <UNK> to the sea and 500 <UNK> to civilization and if you are at a castle there are going to be tourists everywhere we see a lot of <UNK> of <UNK> in the movie and sometimes we see what appears to be north american <UNK> the story did not exactly appeal to me maybe because the acting was so bad when the characters see the <UNK> creatures for the first time they are not even scared i guess their acting skills were <UNK> to display realistic emotions at the end there is an unexpected twist but it didn't impress me since i didn't really care br br the <UNK> creatures are cheap but they had the potential to be scary unfortunately they fail since we get a good look at them standing in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle also there are no really scary scenes since the <UNK> creatures are mostly just standing around br br anyway conclusion <UNK> the facts the movie is your typical b horror flick i guess people from other countries can enjoy it more as long as you are unaware of reality it doesn't matter just like i think of usa as one big action movie set everyone else can think of <UNK> as a forest with a castle and some living dead people in a <UNK>
<START> the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when i'm making fun of it jamie <UNK> spears only got the acting job because of her big sister and i don't think anyone could argue with me on that there is no expression in her face ever even when she smiles just watch the show and you'll see what i mean now let's talk about the show <UNK> 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows i've ever seen as a lot of people have already said <UNK> brooks is absolutely perfect everyone loves her she's a straight a student and all the boys think that she's hot is a <UNK> school full of rich kids that gives all their students flat screen <UNK> and <UNK> computers serving kids <UNK> from the <UNK> bar in one of the <UNK> episodes <UNK> is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her and acts as if she doesn't even want chase to love her then when she into <UNK> <UNK> room to prove her friends wrong she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca <UNK> of course freaks out probably because she likes the attention from chase anyway only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is <UNK> 101 you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is
<START> dumb meaningless movie should appeal to southern <UNK> teenagers with <UNK> <UNK> on retarded and the average bush <UNK> noble <UNK> plays the lead in this <UNK> script for what it is and uses a generous dose of <UNK> this and <UNK> that and <UNK> the ending which i anticipated to save this hollow story was the biggest letdown leaving me hanging and wondering why br br it's a story of cat mouse or more like bully vs victim br br don't waste your time unless you like hearing the phone <UNK> every 2 minutes and constant <UNK> and screaming throughout this <UNK> minute piece of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the concept for this movie was quite good but somehow the execution failed on many parts there aren't many horror movies that i can think of that used dolls that looked so realistic especially when these dolls start <UNK> their eyes or moving hands so much could have been done with this premise there were a lot of scenes where there was room for tension and suspense and i really was expecting creepy things to happen but never did the movie managed to be scary one of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable i actually thought that they did this on purpose in order to surprise us with some wonderful twist sadly this doesn't happen well at least not in the way that i hoped for the cast also failed to make it all believable it would have been nice if more background was given on the characters in the beginning when we get introduced to the main character it seems that she and other characters are invited by some sort of artist but it also is apparent that they don't have an idea themselves what they are invited for of course this is part of the mystery but it does seem unlikely if i got an <UNK> without having a clue what the deal is i simply would not go furthermore most characters aren't real likable with the end result that you never actually care for them another flaw is that the director <UNK> from the basic premise which is scary enough and brings up new elements that never get explained and aren't even relevant to the doll master mystery overall this movie has been a big disappointment to me if you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls go see dead silence
<START> the thing has to be one of the all time great movies of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much back in 1982 it just blew my mind i'd never seen anything like that however although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific it was the story itself the music score the claustrophobic atmosphere of the as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic br br movies don't get any better than this in the opening scene with the the <UNK> chasing this <UNK> you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam yet when you see them continue their chase at the us base you then think that the <UNK> are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever yet this is <UNK> by the menacing opening music score that sets the <UNK> you just know that something is not right at this point it's a mystery until 'the <UNK> reveals itself br br however the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of agatha christie who <UNK> i e ten little indians movie sci fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien the <UNK> between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown br br after 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in the thing don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982 but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast
<START> i cannot understand why so many people did not like this film robert de niro was on top of his game delivering his lines with such <UNK> one has to believe this is his everyday demeanor granted the film seemed to take on many buddy film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept it goes without saying this film was genuinely funny from the police dog to the fact eddie murphy didn't annoy the heck out of me this film is a real keeper <UNK> russo also <UNK> out the rest of the cast perfectly establishing her role so it does not <UNK> with the budding relationship between de niro and murphy
<START> first of all i'm upset there's no choice of a 0 out of 10 br br i was bored tonight and while flipping through the channels i see dr <UNK> with there being nothing else on i decide to watch it expecting it to be just another crappy horror movie with a similar plot to cabin fever br br man was i wrong dr <UNK> made cabin fever look like it should have won numerous academy awards may i remind you cabin fever contains a scene of a little <UNK> boy doing <UNK> kicks off of a <UNK> screaming <UNK> characters who leave their dying friend in a tiny shack to bleed to death and shawn from boy meets world <UNK> <UNK> a hole in a girl's <UNK> br br so needless to say dr <UNK> was a big <UNK> pile o crap it wasn't even funny crap it reminded me of a horror movie i had to make in <UNK> grade called the <UNK> except for the fact that the <UNK> had a better script we wrote it about an hour before filming better actors plots bloody scenes and camera work i was hoping to get some laughs out of a poorly made horror film but instead i could only watch in <UNK> as i thought to myself was this made by <UNK> <UNK> br br the acting was horrible the events and different little subplots were thrown together and didn't make sense and the gore and violence was very minimal i liked how that from a small stab wound people died instantly and the only weapons the killers had were small pocket knives if you're going to make a horror movie at least give the killer s an insane killing device br br also what the hell was the point of the <UNK> girls <UNK> their <UNK> good way to bring in some scenes of girls running around in their <UNK> even if they have no relevance to the story whatsoever and i must say my favorite line was when the blonde says to dr <UNK> i'd like to introduce you to someone my inner bitch her inner bitch then proceeds to grab a garbage can throw it at dr <UNK> miss and back up in terror of the killer br br well that was a long one but i felt that i needed to express my feelings on how absolutely horrible this movie was i know that everyone has their own opinions but if anyone rates this movie higher than a 2 they should be shot to hell br br seriously
<START> this movie is the latino godfather an unlikely mobster bridges the gap to some unlikely <UNK> and forms an empire i enjoyed the action and <UNK> along with the <UNK> acting and colorful characters this movie is no oscar winner but definitely entertaining hey who needs an oscar anyway br br has got some balls to direct act i think he produced it too this movie reminds me of another filmmaker who likes to do it all robert <UNK> keep it up is there a sequel in the works there are a bunch of strings that need to be tied son comes back and <UNK> <UNK> death
<START> it's great to hear the 3 or so comments that point out what <UNK> <UNK> for women the title alone <UNK> away any supposed <UNK> women have in the media industry or society <UNK> them to two dimensional cartoon caricatures of how men think women should behave it is a post modern moronic farce it might as well be called who stays at home and knows her <UNK> br br on one hand it could actually be some sort of parody on the u k 's <UNK> trash press representation of celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a <UNK> society so women can <UNK> stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and own the image that has been created for them by <UNK> desire <UNK> that would be to ironic and clever i also sound like i should be <UNK> it br br <UNK> is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously just like an even cheaper cruella de <UNK> she just needs some <UNK> condescending yet at the same time self laugh to show off her true acting range oh she does right anyway it just about sums up whom this is aimed at either who think its an up roaring send up of <UNK> proportions or people who think its <UNK> finest actors <UNK> stop watching this <UNK> of a <UNK> and get a life br br its utterly sexist and is of such low quality that maybe those who enjoy it think they are in on the joke do the actors really care or understand what they are <UNK> its so <UNK> to women and men they are not all self <UNK> selfish football loving <UNK> <UNK> who think women are nothing but another <UNK> to be put on display for the public it's so <UNK> i am sure ms would easily stand up to them in her real life and twist them round her finger as so easily done in <UNK> br br but of course its doesn't really matter i mean its only a t v programme after all so please let it stay <UNK> it's dreadful and will only be looked back on in the same disbelief that <UNK> cell block <UNK> was so <UNK> remembered for br br how did it come to exist it sure ain't subtle or complex it could only come from the same mind set who read magazine and think its alright to look at soft porn and do as many women who bow to their will and <UNK> patriotic and racist comments whenever their football team <UNK> wins it's totally crass
<START> there's nothing new in this movie nothing you haven't thought about before nothing you haven't heard before the story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of people can be <UNK> in many ways and this movie has chosen the most <UNK> and <UNK> one one of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it isn't neither a movie nor a documentary the director has used the of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it was a movie the result is weird and finally i read in previous comments that stated that people who don't like this movie are anti gay i'm pretty sure this comments come from people who consider themselves <UNK> but don't tolerate that other people don't like this movie this is a funny world
<START> a conversation about how jan michael vincent is a lush led me to <UNK> re visit this mid 90s <UNK> entry a kid is traumatized when he sees an ice cream man <UNK> down in the 1950s and he grows up to be a psycho ice cream man clint howard something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice cream blah blah blah br br director norman credited as paul norman made a career of doing porn before this and went right back to it afterward that is what you get for having all murders happen off screen and for casting a skinny kid as a fat kid and making him wear a fat suit just cast a fat kid also there is a scene where vincent <UNK> <UNK> to a group of escaped <UNK> surrounding him he was either totally drunk and was frightened for his life or the filmmakers captured his have i really sunk this low shame full on despite being low budget trash this did line up a few good names including david <UNK> olivia <UNK> david warner and the people <UNK> own doug how you can make a boring slasher with that cast is beyond me
<START> i saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars shelley winters and <UNK> <UNK> and no matter how many times i watch it i can't help but not to cry br br this version was obviously a set like the 1959 was but there were so many mistakes in <UNK> spiral <UNK> items that did not exist in that time period existed in the film doris roberts sad to say cannot play drama she a comedic actress and that will not change james <UNK> was a horrible mr van and mr <UNK> a college professor of mine rather then the dentist he was supposed to play in the original film anne walked the <UNK> to go to <UNK> room that seemed to take her more then a minute in this crappy remake it took her under 10 seconds the first reviewer was correct this remake is just that a remake what was the director thinking casting comedic actors in a drama role like that i'm sorry but james <UNK> cannot play drama max <UNK> was better in deep impact then this movie the <UNK> mrs frank was just that <UNK> i couldn't stand her <UNK> and comparing to the 1959 version i like her better she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother out of 10 stars i give this remake 3 don't waste your time get the 1959 version and a box of <UNK>
<START> being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film i was eagerly <UNK> a laugh a minute roller coaster ride alas br br where to start on this mess i think its a good start to say that its hardly <UNK> and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they <UNK> and decided to leave out of the final cut br br the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and <UNK> which i suppose is good if they want to portray the guest house the 2 <UNK> attempt to run but to me its just puts an even higher on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created br br the acting at times is pathetic <UNK> is wasted as the loony mrs and i've seen simon pegg have much better <UNK> br br i'd recommend guest house <UNK> to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible <UNK> much more but to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true <UNK> and eddie action you have been warned
<START> when you look at <UNK> best movies you will more than likely find that the photography was performed by gabriel <UNK> he is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed his master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of if added to his participation we add the direction of luis <UNK> you will never find such a pair of <UNK> anywhere else in the world this story was written by <UNK> greatest writer besides <UNK> de don de la <UNK> the story in itself is superb a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very christian life but as always there are people that do not accept this he wanders through many places preaching his christianity but finding most of the time people that do not accept him but besides the splendid story it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that <UNK> sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you <UNK>
<START> didn't have much <UNK> for this film but was pleasantly surprised very well made film very well cut doesn't really get to the height that human traffic did but it's a very good effort well directed and i thought the lead actor put in a superb performance in fact the only really bad performance in the film was from tim <UNK> who is supposed to be the name br br cool film surprised it hasn't done better than it has i'd never heard of it until i saw it at a mates br br i'm not a <UNK> but i imagine people who are will really like this film
<START> a woman who deals in art starts to have a passionate love affair with a man named john they make love everywhere they go and they play sexual games the problem i had was that was all they did there was no plot at all to this movie or i just didn't see it the hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie but i wanted something else to happen perhaps he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret i just needed something and all that there was was a bunch of love making scenes not that's it was bad or anything i just wanted more things to happen in the movie perhaps a <UNK> was sleeping with him too anything i was greatly upset that this was all that there was mickey rourke was so hot back then i wonder what happened
<START> for me reviewing movies is an <UNK> of my love of film and of horror cinema in particular the reviews i've written thus far have been for films that i love respect and admire and i have eagerly rewarded them with glowing <UNK> and perfect ten ratings a life long horror movie fan it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films and to hopefully have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out i only recently began reviewing films for the imdb and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites <UNK> those which i believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre however the existence of films like <UNK> day is without pun a thorn in my side completely devoid of any merit whatsoever this 1981 <UNK> of <UNK> ideas is <UNK> directed poorly acted and in every sense an <UNK> embarrassment to horror cinema during the brief couple of years before and after this movie's release we saw the appearance of domestic and canadian films such as halloween ii prom night terror train madman my bloody valentine the <UNK> just before dawn final <UNK> and hell night among others these films though of varying degrees of quality clearly <UNK> to achieve something in terms of story line plotting acting direction and overall tone not every movie released during this <UNK> season of the slasher era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original halloween or friday the 13th but these films were all well made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema <UNK> day an abysmal farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team was directed by <UNK> freed whom one can only hope will never again attempt to the horror genre with such a travesty the task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre this movie fails miserably on every possible level not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances dime store special effects an irritating musical score and most of all a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense a pointless exercise in how to waste film <UNK> day is an utter disgrace to horror cinema
<START> i had the misfortune of seeing this effort on television a few years ago suffice it to say michael gross phones in his performance and <UNK> is the least convincing thief psycho ever if you have a couple of hours to kill watch it and prepare to laugh
<START> this movie is horrible you won't believe this hunk of junk is even a movie was better then this and was pretty <UNK> bad too a bunch of stupid teens crash in a desert find an old run down <UNK> and end up <UNK> off <UNK> badly stop motion animated <UNK> <UNK> my french but the acting was bad as hell the person who wrote this probably didn't even know what a spider is because he had the <UNK> living in a colony serving an alien queen ripoff queen spider <UNK> do not live in <UNK> this movie is a piece of <UNK> at the end the marines suddenly pop out of no where and kill all the spider without even being called if you see a copy of this movie at a video store it in <UNK> and throw a match at it
<START> movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever <UNK> falls into the latter category this is the type of thing that should win academy awards a brilliant visual <UNK> of film that is both depressing and uplifting instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of <UNK> <UNK> director paul <UNK> <UNK> three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on earth the day he tried to lead the japanese military into rebellion in the name of the emperor failing to do that he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of <UNK> the three short story adaptations allow a look into what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays ken is magnificent as <UNK> despite his <UNK> he comes off as very sympathetic a man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does this makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful of the three story adaptations temple of the golden house and runaway horses it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional it also is the story that most closely matches mood in his final years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of november 1970 this review cannot be complete without a mention of philip <UNK> striking musical score not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to it's visuals paul <UNK> crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter have the <UNK> at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears <UNK> a life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant
<START> <UNK> is about an enormous <UNK> designed not to keep enemies out but to keep its own people <UNK> br br <UNK> is about a very long border <UNK> <UNK> with silent <UNK> and automatic firing br br <UNK> is about the denial of the basic human rights of life liberty and the pursuit of br br <UNK> is about the fear and pain that <UNK> so many br br <UNK> is about one attempt to risk a crossing through the border br br <UNK> is about a loving father whose only desire is to give his boys what should never have been taken away from <UNK> br br <UNK> is about a disturbed mother who wants her babies and her husband br br <UNK> is about a caring husband who wants his family to be together but in a better <UNK> br br <UNK> is about children who want to be free to reach at anytime the br br <UNK> is about a hot air balloon <UNK> and built by two br br <UNK> is about a balloon which could go just high enough to crash or catch fire and br br <UNK> is about two determined men who want their family to climb into a hot air balloon and <UNK> away to br br <UNK> is about the fear of getting caught by an evil br br <UNK> is about a sensible man who can't let bad dreams stop <UNK> br br <UNK> is about an icy policeman who wants every <UNK> tower on full br br with exquisite music by jerry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes us realize the true value of <UNK> br br final thoughts br br there are a few moments in everyone's life certainly in public lives that can define a person br br for those of us old enough to remember the reagan <UNK> seeing the clips again in the wake of his death makes it seem like those events happened just yesterday or last week the voice the expressions are all so familiar but for a large <UNK> of people these events might as well have happened fifty years ago if not more they are part of the distant past president reagan is a name and not much more president <UNK> is another name and not much more so how can we remember these two men who had such a huge impact on their country br br reagan and <UNK> worked together to tear down the berlin wall and to steer their <UNK> nations away from nuclear
<START> this is truly one of the worst movies ever made and i don't mean in a so bad it's good kind of way eddie murphy is a great comic and it is a testament to how bad this movie is that it nearly killed his career the writing and direction are inept the sets and staging about as imaginative as a brady bunch episode and the acting shows just how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with if it weren't for the costumes which aside from eddie murphy's ego seem to account for the major part of the budget you would swear this thing was slapped together by a bunch of high <UNK> wasted on <UNK> that anyone could find this travesty in any way funny or entertaining is mind <UNK> it's probably no coincidence that the misguided souls who are <UNK> this stinker are barely <UNK> but if your idea of hilarity is della reese getting her <UNK> toe shot off then by all means put aside your <UNK> cup and go rent this movie
<START> this was shown on a <UNK> channel so i didn't realise it was made for tv even so i like some of the movies on lifetime lifestyle here in uk but this was awful the family were so cheesy love you mum love you even more honey then after they were broken into for the second time 10 mins later they were at it again love you mum big cheesy smiles etc she phones her husband and tells him not to bother coming home they were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead have a <UNK> living next door who needs help she has her teenage daughter and a cat not for long to look after her br br however as a comedy i'd give it a good 7 i might even show it to my friends next time i have them round could be great fun after a bottle of <UNK> or 10
<START> this is quite possibly the worst sequel ever made the script is unfunny and the acting stinks the exact opposite of the original
<START> if we consider three films with a similar subject which are this one which was made in 1930 'the covered made in <UNK> and made in 1950 the distance between 'the big and 'the covered is only 7 years whereas the distance between 'the big and is 20 years this is amazing because it shows how much movies evolved in those 7 years and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to come 'the big trail is technically close to but ages apart from 'the covered the story is about the <UNK> going from the <UNK> to the west in <UNK> <UNK> power sr is the man leading the <UNK> he is a rough and mean guy john wayne is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks not giving him a chance to be the wayne that we are used to <UNK> <UNK> is such a proud lady that you wonder why wayne just does not forget her <UNK> walsh was a master at showing <UNK> and cattle moving through the west he directed 'the tall <UNK> in 1955 which has a lot in common with 'the big
<START> it's <UNK> but then what else did you expect the heroine is <UNK> younger sister complete with wicked mother sister and brother in law the hero if you can call him that is an <UNK> <UNK> and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic <UNK> br br the cast settings and wardrobe were all very attractive and i thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was the movie was <UNK> filmed and <UNK> a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout <UNK> sang <UNK> and provided the film with some of its best moments br br if you love <UNK> steel you will love this film if you love <UNK> romance you will love this film i did not i was able to sit through it but it was close
<START> i walked into the movie theater with no expectations for the film i was about to witness everything is <UNK> i walked out with a joy i have barely come to feel with american films the directorial debut of actor <UNK> the film follows a man on his journey through the past accompanied by an eccentric group including a <UNK> dancing barely english speaking punk from the his grandfather who believes he is blind and their crazy dog the first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely european flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters while the second half of the film <UNK> into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust this little movie brings out so many emotions and so many colors with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of <UNK> but also of relationships and connections the acting is incredibly powerful the story mysterious and interesting and the artistic appeal of the cinematography to die for with some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes everything is <UNK> managed to capture my heart
<START> i was very willing to give rendition the benefit of the doubt when it came to all the negative press i had read concerning it even about three quarters of the way through i still thought it was <UNK> and a bit incoherent but otherwise a solid tale reaching its conclusion and then the bottom fell out not wanting to necessarily ruin the film for anyone but the conclusion <UNK> everything you held to be fact about what and when things have been happening on its no particular reason whatsoever except to maybe tell the world yeah i'm cool and i know it i love a good twist i love a good ah ha moment but only when it is relevant to the story at hand the complete on the part of the filmmakers serves no purpose on the overall tale <UNK> didn't need to be parallel and they didn't need to be separated by a week all the revelation did was destroy any merit i was about to give director <UNK> hood and screenwriter <UNK> sane which may be a good thing because looking back it wasn't really as solid a movie as i initially was going to <UNK> give it credit for br br it is an admirable thing to try and get the term rendition out into the film going <UNK> consciousness but it needed a story that <UNK> deeper into the <UNK> and politics involved rather than <UNK> over those issues for a tale of a woman in distress over her husband's disappearance and the angst filled rebellion of a daughter against her <UNK> father i understand that the bottom line film needs a human quality to grasp onto and for that reason i don't fault it for going that route my only <UNK> is that we don't get enough of what the title says we should be getting instead we are shown numerous plot lines all <UNK> brought to the <UNK> before being sent back into the <UNK> <UNK> of our consciousness never to be returned to so much is going on that you forget what you are supposed to be caring for the wife the <UNK> the cia agent the victim the senator the middle eastern daughter and her <UNK> boyfriend at the end i really just gave up and let the film take me where it would which ended up being someone totally different than what it first laid out br br everything that occurs happens as the result of a bomb explosion this bomb is at the center of every story thread and finally ends up being so <UNK> that you can't believe how huge the waves it spread were the old <UNK> wings <UNK> quote is in full effect because one boy's mission for revenge ends up destroying the lives of so many whether by death destruction physical and emotional abuse or career suicide no one really escapes <UNK> however at the end of the day only the story about the man who has been <UNK> to egypt for torture is really interesting we are led to believe he is <UNK> innocent from the start yet he is <UNK> etc in order to <UNK> any information he might have when those in power include a man with no compassion or reason to stop until something is <UNK> whether true or not and an <UNK> without the guts to <UNK> or stop it the situation lends itself some intrigue as to how it could possibly end the three actors involved all are the best parts of the film and prove once more that the movie should have concerned itself with them for the entirety br br i don't want to <UNK> people like reese <UNK> the <UNK> wife or her <UNK> employed ex played by peter <UNK> because they actual do a good job with what they are given even meryl streep her <UNK> accent and alan arkin don't detract too much however it is the trio of jake <UNK> cia agent <UNK> and omar victim that truly shine is brilliant as the egyptian trying to stay sharp as a razor during working hours yet compassionate and worry filled as a father attempting to locate his daughter this man is brutal but he is because that is what his <UNK> calls for and why he is relied upon to find answers never gives a false second during the pain and suffering inflicted upon him whether he is lying or truly knows nothing about the terrorist who has been calling his cell phone we totally buy into his plight and desperately wait to see how the situation turns out as for <UNK> someone who seems to have one performance recycled throughout his career with varying degrees of success he finds a part that suits him the demons entering his soul throughout the ordeal he is forced to be a part of wear on his body and mind causing both <UNK> and a need to <UNK> the two feelings <UNK> with each other until he makes a final decision and his stoic <UNK> demeanor suit that battle perfectly br br it is just too bad that the one plot line working never finds itself as the main <UNK> point despite being the <UNK> of the film with all the clutter around the edges we as an audience get <UNK> around too much <UNK> into a sense of time and sequence and then slapped in the face as it all <UNK> in more of a laugh on us then a bet you didn't see that coming i felt cheated and unfortunately that is the lasting effect i have taken from the movie had it been more straightforward i might have enjoyed myself more but as is one can still take some <UNK> from the severely flawed whole
<START> so here's a bit of background on how i came to see this movie as you probably know this is the original french film that was then remade <UNK> surprise by hollywood as wicker park well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released simply because a i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park and living in chicago i didn't see why they called it that it was filmed in canada for a start b i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes done purely because hollywood thinks we're too bone <UNK> to read a few subtitles i am <UNK> the remake of <UNK> affairs by the way and c i can't stand josh <UNK> <UNK> said there br br however i came across on tv the other day probably about half an hour in and i have to say initially it made no sense at all until about half an hour from the end when it started coming together by the end i was really surprised to find myself really into it and then the ending just seemed so good a perfect combination of story passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i've ever seen heard br br since then i've heard a lot about the <UNK> vs wicker park argument and looking at i still say it has <UNK> all to do with chicago but there seemed something about it that i liked so when it was on again i watched it again unfortunately still missing the first <UNK> i've still yet to see it and i still thought it was pretty good heck even josh <UNK> seemed good but i was curious about <UNK> and wanted to see what all the fuss was about so i waited and waited to catch <UNK> somewhere somehow netflix let me down so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland and i've just watched it br br it's really kind of weird but a good weird a classic french film great acting is an absolute gem sorry but she acts monica <UNK> off the screen in every scene vincent <UNK> was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works and i've seen jean <UNK> in a lot of movies and i just love him the scene where alice <UNK> him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his been run over was excruciating but i can honestly say having seen and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy as about 75 of the rest of the movie had been maybe in a different order but come on the scene with the coffee in the glasses word for word you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of <UNK> i can literally say i was blown away hmm a bit like poor old <UNK> was through the <UNK> window really so be prepared if you've seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie because you'll either be disappointed or <UNK> at a piece of french movie history a prime example of how you can watch a movie think you're going to watch a <UNK> happy ending and get <UNK> from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end definitely catch this movie oh and while you're at maybe not too near the same time but down the road take a look at wicker park it'll surprise you too
<START> have you ever wondered why these guys seagal stallone willis et al manage to survive all those <UNK> in which they're <UNK> i think i've got it figured out the enemies always miss and the hero doesn't br br here seagal has a pistol and a half dozen <UNK> firing at him from a few feet away one of the <UNK> has a shotgun or maybe two of them have it doesn't really matter there could be a thousand <UNK> <UNK> away at him and seagal would still emerge with his <UNK> intact br br and when it comes to <UNK> a <UNK> combat forget it the <UNK> may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but seagal with his skill in <UNK> or or or play do or whatever it is <UNK> them aside with a few <UNK> blows not only is he a master of these <UNK> skills but his physical strength is <UNK> more than once he <UNK> <UNK> long bones as easily as we would break a <UNK> one he breaks a guy's spine over his <UNK> br br i'll tell you something i'm getting into the spirit of the film here because seagal uses that line i'll tell you something several times along with what's that supposed to mean these guys are fully deserving of <UNK> in any good <UNK> they are all black speak with <UNK> may can accents wear <UNK> that look in dire need of a <UNK> they torture and murder with <UNK> and here's the worst part they're <UNK> that's right they practice voodoo br br actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film they got the <UNK> of the ritual pretty well <UNK> smoke <UNK> spitting the <UNK> chicken they only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer they should have read on voodoo br br otherwise the plot <UNK> to the usual conventions what was done to <UNK> by the voodoo <UNK> in the deep is done here to a friend of <UNK> what was done to john wayne when he was stuck between <UNK> in is done here to seagal himself at the movie's very opening when seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his <UNK> career so he's now happily retired and when we are introduced to his friends and family i tried to keep track of his to see if i could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or <UNK> to generate his quest for revenge br br the acting doesn't really require much comment but charles the <UNK> cop played by tom wright is really pretty good wright has considerable range here he's an associate of dubious <UNK> rather sinister but in the <UNK> wars he has a comic part that he <UNK> perfectly br br the never flew as movie villains i don't know why exactly it's a small movie market and if you go to stick to bay however if you want to see <UNK> voodoo drug dealers as <UNK> and if you're in the mood for another typical standard action flick this should be a satisfying view
<START> steven seagal is a thief who <UNK> in robbing drug dealers giving to the poor and unfortunate <UNK> <UNK> the robin hood anyway <UNK> wants to go straight for his girl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so he takes on a job as the driver of an <UNK> car for a max stevens kevin <UNK> wasted in an <UNK> role max <UNK> to have the millions for himself and his <UNK> associates with the intent of using his <UNK> bruno robert to bring him the money but <UNK> has other plans escaping the police hiding the money and <UNK> bruno who had a loaded gun pointed at head threatening to shoot him if he didn't drive after <UNK> capture by <UNK> a huge dump truck <UNK> passes out charged with the murder of police among other things as a result of the damage caused by the high speed chase <UNK> is imprisoned and many wish to know where the money is <UNK> joins forces with an <UNK> ice a leader of one of the many gangs in the prison breaking out with the plans of finding max and <UNK> every member of his corrupt <UNK> soon <UNK> agent rachel <UNK> sarah becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss <UNK> nick <UNK> who claims there's drugs involved also <UNK> into the plot is desire to save a children's hospital about to close and <UNK> has mysterious dreams regarding max br br seagal and cut up with each other speaking in <UNK> while spends time trying to help <UNK> <UNK> the possibility her boss is in <UNK> with max character is an odd duck allowing rachel much <UNK> despite the threat she is to his career <UNK> shows up for five or so minutes tops which is a shame <UNK> <UNK> escapes prison and finds each and every rich associate of <UNK> inevitably discovering his <UNK> after cracking a few <UNK> <UNK> some <UNK> and breaking some bones speaks in his <UNK> speech and seagal tries to answer him in kind providing some unintentional laughs as you'd expect a lot of people get shot and seagal doesn't break a sweat it's interesting seeing seagal in prison among the <UNK> helping out when a group of plan to take him out
<START> br br this is the best mock documentary of a dog show that i have seen in a long time a very long time well lets face it ever isn't that part of the charm the idea of actually going to the trouble to make a movie mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find odd in the first place even if there were no big laughs one would still be <UNK> at the thought any movie that attempts something new scores highly in my proverbial book i loved the dogs too
<START> the opening of <UNK> a <UNK> resembles a <UNK> <UNK> music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie br br in terms of what theo br br in terms of everything but especially excitement i doubt if there's ever been a more <UNK> slower moving movie than this one yeah okay it's a european art house movie so i wasn't expecting charles bronson to massacre <UNK> of bad guys but even so i did expect some substance if not an actual plot br br the film revolves around professor <UNK> von visiting <UNK> <UNK> visits <UNK> and goes on a <UNK> <UNK> eats in an expensive restaurant <UNK> looks out of his hotel window and if it's excitement you want <UNK> has a flashback br br bad enough if this was the entire movie but it gets worse because <UNK> notices a pretty boy teenager so you've got a middle aged academic <UNK> after some teenage boy he has seen some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger great idea for a movie i don't think so either and thank <UNK> it remained a yawn fest instead of some sleazy <UNK> to gay porn br br i notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to it i can only be <UNK> and <UNK> in my view and say that the only subtext i could relate to was the physical and emotional <UNK> of <UNK> but it wasn't caused by the <UNK> beauty of the teenage boy it was caused by watching such a boring and <UNK> movie
<START> a <UNK> collection of western tourists in africa suffer the misfortune of their plane breaking down so they're compelled to hop on a bus to travel across the desert to reach the nearest jumping off point back to civilization not surprisingly the <UNK> <UNK> ends up not working and they find themselves way off course coming to a stop at a deserted ghost town that had been a <UNK> during the fighting in wwii they find some <UNK> useless in terms of re filling the tank of their bus a <UNK> room full of half <UNK> <UNK> in tin <UNK> and a native <UNK> who views them with indifference the one fellow amongst them who appears to have something on the ball in terms of <UNK> techniques goes off to get help they are to remove the <UNK> from the bus and burn them if he's not back in five days hopefully someone will see the black smoke br br does this sound interesting well sure even if it sounds a lot like the flight of the phoenix or any number of films in the deserted island genre which is why it's surprising that the king is alive is number 4 if anyone is still counting in the ongoing dogma 95 series which if i remember that ridiculous dogma 95 <UNK> of <UNK> correctly <UNK> that genre films are strictly <UNK> <UNK> well anyway you can tell it's gonna try and be all arty and stuff in order to compensate for the fact that it's a genre flick yep it doesn't take long for one member of the group a <UNK> old stage actor to start <UNK> down from memory the various roles from king <UNK> on well rolls of paper the idea is that performing the play will help while away the time all of which really goes against the <UNK> advice to stay optimistic didn't the old actor ever do a dinner theater performance of the odd couple just once in his life quite apart from such an activity being a <UNK> waste of precious time and energy br br this movie is so bad i really don't know how to continue it's so <UNK> stupid so full of absurd situations and characters that it <UNK> rational criticism it may be a <UNK> moment to offer full <UNK> i despise this so called danish film movement to an almost irrational degree i think my face even turns slightly red at the mere mention of dogma 95 first of all if the name of your movement has the word dogma in the title you've already lost me secondly in this particular instance the <UNK> on the of individual artistic achievement is a recipe for arch <UNK> when you consider that the filmmakers here are <UNK> one of the greatest works of the greatest individual writer who ever lived but <UNK> the dogma crowd believes the works of shakespeare were actually penned by a of <UNK> <UNK> like the earl of <UNK> francis bacon walter <UNK> and the queen herself br br hell i may have forgiven the whole enterprise if it had played the scenario for <UNK> purposes attacking the precious dogma now that would be <UNK> but the movie takes itself very seriously and soon <UNK> into the clichés attendant upon the genre in which it <UNK> belongs people turning against each other the men growing <UNK> the inevitable deaths of a few of the principal actors all with a straight face is this the promised end well not quite we also have to endure the abysmal transfer of <UNK> for this is another rule in the dogma 95 <UNK> of <UNK> hand held digital video only some friendly advice to the danes your movement is in trouble when your finished product has worse visual quality than an average high school <UNK> home video <UNK> belongs in an <UNK> bag of tricks right alongside his own <UNK> <UNK> and artist are <UNK> words mr von trier not every jackass with a 100 hand held can be a filmmaker pass it on and by the way allow your dogma directors to be credited for their films while you're at it the fact that the writer of the king is alive receives credit while the guy or girl actually filming it doesn't is just a wee bit <UNK> br br <UNK> 1 star out of 10
<START> please if you're thinking about renting this movie don't if you're thinking of watching a couple of <UNK> clips don't if i had my way nobody would even have to read this summary br br the acting despite being one <UNK> the high points of the movie was still pathetic the director was <UNK> a <UNK> the witty one liners were something you'd expect from a room of highly paid anti social 7 year olds that eat paint <UNK> for breakfast br br the problem with this movie is that it tries to be a movie like evil dead 2 do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies in that it's so bad it's funny but it also tries to be funny at the same time and fails so <UNK> to do so that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag <UNK> in an to save itself br br i could go on for much much more <UNK> just how awful it really was but i think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it if you need me i'll be off trying to <UNK> myself so that i might feel clean again
<START> oh why did it have to end like this laurel and <UNK> last film from the <UNK> <UNK> up <UNK> theme with <UNK> credit to hal roach to the closing nice mess i couldn't help it <UNK> this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves in between their relationship is now solely constructed of uncertain acting <UNK> dialogue and half hearted slapstick people <UNK> king of new york but <UNK> final bow out was nowhere near as as this br br what really hurts to someone who loves laurel and hardy is the appearance of the two comedians the video cover i'm holding shows them at their prime all <UNK> smiles and glowing skin with a <UNK> on the back that reads the photograph on this <UNK> is for <UNK> purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film necessarily it doesn't even come close the actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that <UNK> the <UNK> with ollie <UNK> overweight this is not <UNK> or <UNK> fat as he would normally appear but ill looking and on the verge of <UNK> he would be dead seven years after this film was made after a series of <UNK> stan meanwhile suffering a <UNK> problem and looks <UNK> as his weight has <UNK> drastically every time something bad happens to him such as getting <UNK> between a <UNK> and a table you fear for his life even ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed he would last for another fifteen years after the <UNK> of this film eventually passing away from a heart attack in 1965 it's <UNK> to think of such <UNK> performers growing old and dying painful deaths and it's <UNK> watching their <UNK> both in health and in performance on screen when i and i'm sure almost everyone else likes to think of laurel and hardy i think of way out west busy bodies or our relations seeing them in such physical ill health and performing dire routines at the dog end of their career is a <UNK> on my happy memories of them br br the warning signs are clear right from the opening credits which list not only four writers but also someone to come up with the concept and a credit for gags so if monty collins was writing the gags then what were the other four writing and in that case why was monty collins paid a <UNK> given that there's no evidence of a single gag in the whole film over 40 of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in when i saw the bat scene i wanted to <UNK> up and die so great was its childish <UNK> yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed unable to speak english not only does this make the film disjointed but also it severely stan and <UNK> reactions to their co stars <UNK> directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing this totally <UNK> the <UNK> 2 million that was spent on it frankly it looks terrible and while a dvd release might clean up the picture the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their hal roach work br br stan and <UNK> friends and <UNK> are charisma free <UNK> who stand out greatly against laurel and <UNK> outdated <UNK> this is another major problem with the film in that none of the supporting characters are funny or <UNK> in to the <UNK> innocent mentality the dubbed <UNK> shown to l h you the fat one makes them stand out as isolated social <UNK> rather than <UNK> sub there is evidence of some darker political satire though duck soup this ain't and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic perhaps more relevant now than it ever was a film that looks at the problems of <UNK> and the american <UNK> suddenly becomes most <UNK> in 2003 sadly however beyond an amusing scene where stan is elected the people this doesn't really go anywhere and this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges or is a laurel and hardy movie where rape is directly implied and stan threatens a man with a bottle only to accidentally glass someone in the face your idea of a good time after all the years of stan and ollie sharing a bed we also get a definite reference with stan accidentally kissing him ollie <UNK> off the kiss in disgust also worrying is the <UNK> that stan and <UNK> illegal immigrant friend <UNK> ends his life being eaten by a lion mind you i never thought i'd see a laurel and hardy movie where they were due to be <UNK> either the need for the <UNK> and unfunny narration is a further <UNK> to how messy the whole thing is with the american release the same version available on video <UNK> out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it br br almost completely unwatchable this <UNK> made relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to <UNK> the reputation of stan and ollie avoid at all costs
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comedy is best remembered for featuring a young buster keaton fresh from splitting with his family's vaudeville act in his film debut buster gets quite a substantial part in this film and it's quite a funny one overall the butcher boy has lots of laughs and is an example of pure old fashioned slapstick done well though it would seem to come from the brief era of two reel comedies when filmmakers still imagined in one reel segments as a matter of course br br the first half of the film takes place in a general store with <UNK> as the the butcher boy of the title it's an excuse to mine the many possibilities for fast physical humor that a general store provides and <UNK> really shows himself to be a 300 pound <UNK> <UNK> subtlety skill and grace in his performance of what might have been <UNK> slapstick routines that raise them to a different level a running gag has him flipping a large butcher knife casually so that it <UNK> accurately into it's proper position stuck into the cutting board and i'm still stunned that <UNK> really seems to do it each time there's also a really nice gag that sees him <UNK> on his scale and confused as to why his cuts of meat <UNK> so much br br buster keaton is a boy who comes into to buy some <UNK> and performs <UNK> in a foot stuck to floor routine that follows apart from the odd and almost unsettling half smile his <UNK> attitude and body language make him recognizable immediately as the buster we know he even has his eventually <UNK> <UNK> hat here destroyed for the first time when filled of course with <UNK> br br the second half of the film moves into more situation based comedy and <UNK> and his rival al st john dress in drag to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> school a lot of the humor also comes from the generally surreal and mysteriously laugh inducing sight of these two odd <UNK> wearing drag and trying to be girls buster is in this segment too but mostly stands there in the occasional <UNK> helping st john br br the ending of the butcher boy becomes a little <UNK> frenetic but on the whole and beyond its historical curiosity interest it's a well done comedy that gets just the <UNK> laughs it is going for
<START> i would like to know if anyone know how i can get a copy of the movie that's the way of the world it's been about 30 years since i've seen this movie and i would like to see it again earth wind fire <UNK> the nation <UNK> with their inspirational music and themes it was unfortunate that this group didn't take off like their counterparts in the early 70's but as previously stated racial tension existed in the united states which <UNK> exposure for the african american musical groups it is good to see that earth wind fire continuing their success i would like to add this movie to my collection someone please help me if possible thank you for your attention <UNK> shaw
<START> honestly awful film bad editing awful lighting dire dialog and <UNK> screenplay br br the lighting at is so bad there's moments you can't even see what's going on i even tried to playing with the contrast and <UNK> so i could see something but that didn't help br br they must have found the script in a bin the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a jean claude van damme film this one manages to hit an all time low you can't even laugh at the br br the directing and editing are also terrible the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it <UNK> through the plot that is so weak it's just unreal br br there's not a lot else to say other than it's really bad and nothing like jean claude van <UNK> earlier work which you could enjoy br br avoid like the <UNK> frankly words fail me in <UNK> this film
<START> first of all let me say this film isn't for everyone it has a very strange subject matter a <UNK> living alone and living a boring life discovers a young man in a park just across the street from her <UNK> she notices him sitting out in the rain and invites him in to dry off warm up the man does not speak and the woman assumes he is deaf mute still she is fascinated with him and sexually interested in him he finds her odd and continues his silence although we find out later that he isn't mute at all and that he reports to his sister everything that is going on between him the woman i won't give away the rest of the plot if you can find this film watch it you cannot take your eyes off of it what makes it so interesting well it is totally unique i've never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very uncomfortable especially when you find out what this bland boring obsessive <UNK> is capable of you won't forget it soon
<START> obsessed i have every season of <UNK> girls and i think the reason i love it so much is because of how smart the script is its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on if you missed you missed it and its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks i think <UNK> girls is one of the <UNK> shows on t v shows of its time its fun because they talk so fast you can't get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is br br and you can relate to the characters also their so real and there actors are superb from the witty to the <UNK> luke to the immature kirk the show is just amazing i definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with there family this is definitely the show for them there is only one word that can describe <UNK> girls classic
<START> the late director john <UNK> directed his first feature film the young stranger after starting out directing live television dramas in new york city this film came on the heels of the success of rebel without a cause in 1955 james macarthur made his feature film debut as a troubled teen with a movie producer father played by james <UNK> who doesn't establish enough of a relationship with his son kim hunter plays the mother who tries to bridge the gap between her husband and her son the film uses the popular juvenile <UNK> angle of the time to tell its story macarthur gets in trouble at a movie theater with an <UNK> theater manager played by <UNK> <UNK> macarthur in turn has to deal with a police sergeant james gregory bent on teaching him a lesson the material could easily have turned exploitative laughable and sensational like any number of others of the period did however under the sure handed direction of <UNK> the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and <UNK> dynamics the dialog is realistic and most of the scenes hold up surprisingly well some of the scenes with <UNK> as the theater manager and gregory as the police sergeant are a bit heavy handed and dated the performances are uniformly good though which is necessary for a film of this nature and about this topic to succeed this is an impressive feature film debut both for macarthur and <UNK> of 4 stars
<START> to me this movie was just plain confusing slow and uninteresting why did the aliens choose to communicate through ants it makes no sense the ending was muddled and made no sense whatsoever in the end i was hoping that the ants would kill everyone br br avoid this one at all costs not even mst3k could save it
<START> i wish i would have read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before i rented it a waste of money a waste of time very little dialog the dialog was hard to understand in every way the storyline and plot were both weak the only thing that was nice at all was the cinematography br br the characters were interesting at the same time you will spend so much time trying to figure things out because of the lack of dialog that you will be <UNK> the movie a lot br br do not watch this movie it was a mess and will leave you feeling like a mess br br you will say what the heck was that when the movie ends
<START> this was an interesting movie half comedy half political thriller it had a lot of good elements although it was a little predictable br br robin williams stars as tom <UNK> a popular comedian with a hit show in which he gives political commentary think daily show with john stuart during the <UNK> of one of his shows a female in the audience tells him he should run for president that followed by a few jokes taken seriously were all that was needed to get the ball rolling and start political career br br he runs <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> equally he is straightforward and honest and becomes increasingly popular but maybe not popular enough to actually win he's clearly the underdog in this election br br meanwhile a corrupt <UNK> company has created a program to make voting much <UNK> and easier for the common people but there is a <UNK> the <UNK> is discovered by a young lady named <UNK> who is <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> with a lie that he fixed the <UNK> before the upcoming election br br election day comes around and lo and behold <UNK> is <UNK> the winner big surprise <UNK> knows that he is not really the president he didn't win <UNK> she decides to tell the president but complications <UNK> her company went as far as <UNK> her in order to silence her in addition to that she quickly takes a liking to <UNK> br br the plot takes a few twists and turns before reaching it's slightly predictable conclusion but it never got boring robin was great as usual and christopher walken often stole the show as manager turned political <UNK> and best friend br br it's an entertaining film and it has a good message i recommend it if you're in the mood for dark satire or something that makes you think overall i give it a 7 10
<START> i have been waiting to see this film for ages and i finally have as soon as i heard the title i knew that this film would be my favourite film ever and when i saw it believe me i wasn't disappointed br br this film had everything dance love and patrick <UNK> there was so much in it and it dealt with important issues that were at the time 1960's such as abortion br br the dancing in this film was fantastic just like the acting was <UNK> was brilliant just like grey was too br br although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you haven't seen the last scene it really does take your breath away as the whole choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly it had you dancing at the end of the film and it really wouldn't surprise me if it influenced people to take up dancing br br overall dirty dancing is a film not to be missed and even if half the actors are in the where are they now period the actors will always have this superb film in their career
<START> there's only so much that i can take of <UNK> films especially nowadays where the trend is sex action and slapstick comedy which i hate the fact that <UNK> man made me think and made me <UNK> during the movie was a big plus it's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great especially the cinematography i think that <UNK> deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie <UNK> the fact that there's only so few <UNK> movies that i really like i think laurel did such a great job in this movie i truly truly loved this movie technically and character development wise the plot was complex and that's what made it terrific
<START> i had great expectations surrounding this movie not as it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1 2 but high enough and when i saw it on cable they were all <UNK> starting by the acting poor almost mediocre an astonishing waste of good actors and talent and the story itself since when does a 5 men squad go out on <UNK> on a supposed zone to suicide <UNK> one big mistake that costs the film <UNK> very good actors do very poor acting here like sean penn that recently repeated the irritating way of talking on am and michael j fox that wastes a good opportunity to beat charlie sheen on performing just but the most irritating character was diaz played by john <UNK> another stupid waste of fine talent by the director that was a cheesy scared and insecure kind of person even more irritating that jar jar <UNK> yes you heard it the battle sequences are average the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence with michael j fox trapped by his feet on a <UNK> tunnel mr de palma has a weak work here and if it <UNK> for films like and <UNK> these ones excellent films i would consider him a director too much publicity bad filming br br 3 10
<START> i read all of the other comments which made this movie out to be an excellent movie i saw nothing of the excellence that was stated i thought it was long and boring i tried twice to watch it the first time i fell asleep and the second time i made it to within six minutes of the end and gave up i suppose that it was mainly my fault going in with great expectation but i don't think that this would have completely ruined the movie for me the movie was just bland it had nothing that was spectacular or unique to it the plot was not half bad the action sequences were non existent the dialogue forced and the movie just went on forever i would not recommend seeing this movie
<START> up at the villa 2000 1 2 br br warning you may find some spoilers ahead br br it's hard to know what is the point in up at the villa a gorgeous but shallow period piece one of those made with the only objective of <UNK> oscar nominations for best costume design and art set direction one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome it has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year a good looking intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her she has many difficulties but ultimately finds her happiness in the arms of a man that is not the one that she had an accomplishment with in this case our lady is in <UNK> some time before world war ii she is an english widow engaged to a rich but old man whom obviously she doesn't love one day she meets another man who has not a good reputation but for whom she falls in love of course there is her friend who will help her for better or worse and a third man who commits suicide here in the <UNK> room setting up a <UNK> situation for her guess how the story ends br br up at the villa is not a bad film i was always quite interested in the story but never got excited the problem is not the slow pacing but the screenplay adapted from a novel it needs something more <UNK> exciting twists and suspense every time you think the story will get warm it gets <UNK> again if you think there is a conspiracy involving the mean police chief of <UNK> well there is but it doesn't change almost anything in the story it just keeps going and going till the predictable ending br br as i said up at the villa is not bad if it is a bit bland it never gets sappy and too sentimental the acting is half and half but surely convinces <UNK> scott thomas made some really bad choices after the english patient the romantic drama the horse <UNK> and the dull irritating random hearts up at the villa is <UNK> better than those pieces and <UNK> is also better but she can do more than that sean penn is good as always even if his character is a big dude anne <UNK> is a terrific actress the graduate my god and here she doesn't let her character become ridiculous now the supporting actors are pretty bad jeremy davies is <UNK> irritating br br the directing is good but not <UNK> it was interesting to know that the director is the same of angels and insects also starring <UNK> scott thomas another so so period drama but more <UNK> than this what matters here are the visuals <UNK> is wonderful the costumes are great the scenery the music br br in the end up at the villa is an average romantic drama but of course it could have been much better it is watchable and interesting but don't expect a suspense film it is not this film kind of fails because it wants to have some mystery something to behold however there is not much to say mainly because of the shallow screenplay now about the oscar nominations don't worry it will probably get them
<START> this movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet <UNK> it jumps around through his past through his last day and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section it captures the flavor of the man his work and of his times the difficult 1960s br br i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the <UNK> from his works the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazing stylized beautiful and effective they could be used as for any set designer i woke up at night dreaming of the golden <UNK> br br the stories were powerful <UNK> of the nature of man and of art after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist br br i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history
<START> this movie was suspenseful and fun to view as i am a fan of these type of movies i did enjoy this the premise is kind of scary but the fact that i didn't rate this a 10 was because the movie was a little over the top in some areas br br spoilers br br <UNK> nobody could identify this girl i understand the concept of <UNK> <UNK> but i find it hard to believe that somebody anybody wouldn't have been able to id this girl as angela <UNK> that was over the top and so was the scene where she walked over to <UNK> desk and started <UNK> this was overall a really good movie suspenseful and keeps your interest dennis miller was great as allen really believable <UNK> was good as the lonely reserved computer worker the bad guys all <UNK> br br i think the premise of the movie was really different and scary in today's times who knows what could happen but some of the over the top scenes prevented this movie from being a 10 8 of 10
<START> got the chance to see this at a friend's house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget not that this ever bothered me anyway since i love low budget sci fi like dr who <UNK> 7 and dark star hell even <UNK> wasn't a big budget affair so whilst money helps it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good br br the story is straightforward at first with a group of <UNK> paid to <UNK> a prisoner through space their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet they then discover the prisoner has made it too he's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems br br the effects except for the <UNK> are <UNK> and add to the film without overwhelming it computer effects look a bit dodgy at times but serve their purpose well and add to the story <UNK> a futuristic feel to the proceedings films like i robot could have <UNK> from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and <UNK> special effects for a plot like all too many of hollywood's offerings br br whilst none of the actors get oscar material it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesn't <UNK> its welcome the characters don't get fleshed out much but then they didn't in predator either which it resembles in feel big man mike mitchell is a good stand in for arnie and is a good combination of brains and <UNK> br br some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end but i like it unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all and i'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further br br a cracking little film from an <UNK> team done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour if this is what they can do on a <UNK> i'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash and hope the film industry and the talentless <UNK> critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first br br recommended
<START> why what a disgusting joke of a supposed movie from the poster it looked like a cute movie what a disappointment who the heck is the male lead he looks like an old retarded retired reject cop i am a cop and i can tell the man can't act go back to being a cop no screen presence why did they show his bare ass so as if he is mel gibson hell no put the filmmaker out of business this guy has no business making a movie i seriously doubt women or gay men find him attractive whoever cast the film is a no talent hack who cast no talent <UNK> in the lead it's great that us white guys are <UNK> getting the asian women but why an ugly white guy why not dean cain or brad pitt as the white boyfriend why to asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what i see don't get it must be low self <UNK> br br the only hot girl who can act in the movie was the kate <UNK> why was there one hot white chick among all the rest of the ugly asian chicks who think they are hot and can act br br only two actors in this movie the host of the poetry at the end of the movie and the one hot white chick in the <UNK> house <UNK> young and kate <UNK> should have been the leads in the movie br br the asia character was ridiculous looked like she was trying too hard to be some kind of ghetto sexy black girl key word here is trying br br gina you can't act and you are not hot enough physically for this kind of role you need to play character roles and be more humble in your self presentation br br i think the actress is gina i looked her up on the imdb and she is a great asian actress if that is the case i don't want to see what the bad asian american actresses are br br no wonder hollywood doesn't have asian american actors if this is the best they got they were supposedly winning some kind of asian film award give me break it looked like they just made a movie for the sake of putting a bunch of asian girls in them they aren't even hot gina you are not hot stop trying play character roles and improve your acting you are not a leading female type br br if this movies makes money pigs can fly sorry for being so blunt but i feel that these actors actresses need to either get better or work on their craft for the exception of the two actors i mentioned who should have played the leads i say this in love for all the asian lead girls in the film please do what your parents say and go and be doctors lawyers and <UNK> and do acting on the side for fun hopefully that is what you are doing now i am not trying to be mean but hoping this will be read and push you people to either get better or go do another business there was not even a message <UNK> in this movie br br i would not be surprised if soap girls was secretly <UNK> by members of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> special department of asian american hate propaganda of the <UNK> br br otherwise asian people must hate themselves seeing this film makes me as the viewer grateful that i am not asian you folks are pathetic have some self respect you asian people
<START> i have seen this film more then once actually el <UNK> was one of the best feature films that i have seen in a great deal of time br br there was a big cast jennifer <UNK> faye brad <UNK> and <UNK> who really <UNK> like a real star in this part of <UNK> br br i heard this film was shot for under two million dollars i have seen films shot for 33 million that cant compare to the quality and production value br br <UNK> why are you not getting offers and more film work excellent job i cant wait to see the sequel and i hope it has the same action br br jennifer <UNK> has made a cult classic character with br br <UNK> moves <UNK> in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40's and 50's so sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like ben stiller getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show a great film br br go go go kick some but in sales el <UNK>
<START> this show is sheer entertainment and doesn't try to be a greek drama it certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists but it's immensely engaging and fun las vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with anything and everything does happen there the actors in this show are extremely <UNK> and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week the show is also very funny the humor <UNK> from the characters and situations not just thrown in <UNK> it's a well crafted show in that regard it certainly makes me look forward to friday nights and i'm glad i now own the first two seasons on dvd
<START> although many audio <UNK> of great musicians like <UNK> survive the cinematic or <UNK> record is limited indeed this is why musical offerings like they shall have music are such rare gems while with modern eyes and ears one can <UNK> about the plot the <UNK> viewer should put this film's unique <UNK> in their proper perspective the plot was designed to appeal to both young and old audiences of the era but it remains enjoyable to this day a important aspect of the experience of watching classic films is to see them through the eyes of the <UNK> of that era br br i must take issue with reviewer who complains about a film that is in black and white or who feel <UNK> to report that their students express such <UNK> these are juvenile complaints which reflect a limited historical perspective for the teacher this should offer up an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in cinematic history color can in fact get in the way of a good storyline or the music for example the black and white photography of john ford's <UNK> is like the still photographs of adams an artistic masterpiece br br as for being wooden i could not disagree more if you want blatant emotional <UNK> go to a rock concert the role of a classical musician like is to move the audience not him or herself emotion is conveyed through his playing not through his body language he had a rare ability to <UNK> every emotional nuance out of the music and transfer it to his <UNK> it is the <UNK> who should be moved not the artist br br incidentally one reviewer asked about seeing on youtube playing the 1st movement of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with frank <UNK> in the audience this is from the <UNK> film <UNK> hall not they shall have music <UNK> hall is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists in their prime we are blessed that there were film producers who at least in these limited instances chose to showcase these artists in was still an era not totally overwhelmed by the lowest common <UNK> tripe we get today
<START> i was telling a friend of mine about the time my grandfather actually picked this horrible piece of crap for us to see one night at the theater he never picked another one again it was that bad anyway my friend then told me that her father did some of the writing for this garbage i thought she was kidding it turns out she was serious she had never actually seen it and she said that it put a quick halt to her father's writing career i told her not to waste her time but if she did actually break down and watch it she would see within the fist minute why this ended her father's days as a writer i mean even for the 1980's this crap is bad beyond description i mean joe <UNK> as terrible tucker and why in the world would two cops care one bit about a house full of ghosts and the movie poster a ghost with his tongue hanging out what is that about nothing about this makes any sense well i told my friend that this crap not only ended her father's writing career it ended the careers of everybody involved or at least none of them ever fully <UNK> from being in this garbage of a movie let's just say that i will forever <UNK> my friend for revealing to me that her father was a writer for this movie that alone should tell just how bad this is
<START> whereas the movie was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted the script was dull plodding and nothing we have not seen before not once in this film did i ever get the feeling that these people were really in danger no noticeable climax and a very standard resolution i believe these type of movies have been overdone and should be given a rest after all didn't everyone on the planet see <UNK> list
<START> i've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times and it truly gets funnier every time perhaps what i enjoy most is the tired character <UNK> that the movie offers us the somber all american male protagonist his blonde girlfriend the theater nerd with glasses a brunette girl the <UNK> jock and brunette girl 2 however we're then presented with two magician martial arts experts with <UNK> driving a <UNK> if anyone can explain that please contact me among other highlights are bobby <UNK> portrayal of the jock character <UNK> and his trademark line that's why i keep her around in watching <UNK> performance it comes as no surprise that his career quickly <UNK> into the realm of soft core porn spoiler also after multiple viewings i still have absolutely no idea what that big demon at the end says at any point it's just <UNK> noises oh well that's probably for the better and lastly why are all the demons so <UNK> is wet skin scarier it certainly didn't help in this film
<START> the <UNK> of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies then there's the robbery itself a <UNK> thirty minute nail <UNK> that has never been <UNK> followed by what is probably the <UNK> most <UNK> example of <UNK> among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel and we have what is <UNK> the greatest of all heist movies br br this was a tough and <UNK> film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and <UNK> today it displays some of the edgy brutality of <UNK> earlier <UNK> force there isn't a <UNK> moment or duff performance in the entire film and <UNK> captures the <UNK> of seedy <UNK> and <UNK> back streets like no one else and the final drive through paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic closing sequences of any movie a classic
<START> ok i normally don't add comments on movies but i finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of <UNK> t and <UNK> with incompetence that i just had to warn people about <UNK> valley exorcist is loosely about a wife beating <UNK> priest and this <UNK> family of horse freaks and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was <UNK> by the priest but in love with the <UNK> ranch hand gets possessed along with a heroic god <UNK> mexican <UNK> who once <UNK> in a <UNK> the wife beating <UNK> priest manage to save the day but not before the <UNK> demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him all in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless i could get very <UNK> with this part but why waste my energy on this movie sh t i've ever seen any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be <UNK> so that they cannot <UNK> the earth with their useless <UNK>
<START> i have seen many possibly too many straight to video no budget slasher films and have developed a taste for the good ones or the ones that are less <UNK> as ridiculous as that sounds <UNK> dr <UNK> is what i kindly like to refer to as absolute crap nothing about it is enjoyable the acting sucks the characters suck the killer sucks the gore is minimal and sucks it is about a group of college friends who drive out to a newly discovered family cabin owned by the parents of one of the kids it is meant to be a relaxing <UNK> but little do they know that a <UNK> ill former plastic surgeon gone bad along with his two female <UNK> search for <UNK> <UNK> to save the doctor his name is dr <UNK> since he rides around on a motorcycle and of course chops this is just a terrible movie not worthy of anyone's time enough said
<START> what can you possibly say this is the uncut hardcore musical alice it works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the <UNK> and whilst one could wish for a re <UNK> version i guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer pretty much a delight throughout there are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not it also could have been and today would have been too camp no a very fine effort that is amusing <UNK> and just sexy enough fine performances particularly the <UNK> <UNK> in the lead and was that an richard prior as the prone knight being <UNK> if <UNK> ridden
<START> i went to see passion of mind because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances i e <UNK> doors me myself i etc br br but this was the worst one i've ever seen i had to force myself to sit through it i didn't even stay through the credits which is <UNK> of for me br br the magical realism was completely missing because <UNK> moore was grim and the lovers she was two timing were guys who usually play villains though each was kind of sexy and appealing br br there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the <UNK> lives with a <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> complex maybe the magic shouldn't be explained for this genre to work br br originally written 5 28 2000
<START> when <UNK> hear two popular villains characters will be fighting they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end there's freddy vs jason in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other and more similarly to this there's godzilla vs insert name here but the very generic <UNK> vs python is just a horrible title and an even worse premise obviously the movie's a d list picture but at least come up with a more compelling name maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it with a name like this you know what you're getting in to br br a group of military men women including a 20 something year old sexy scientist woman are left for dead by the military on an island inhabited by a giant <UNK> dragon as long as they can make it off the island and to the boat they'll be fine but no there's a giant python <UNK> the ocean and the way off let's hope all these guys can make it off the island and that the python and <UNK> don't <UNK> each other in some sort of horrible special effect battle br br really this movie is bad in almost every way the acting is pretty bad or maybe it's that the special effects are so cheesy that the acting is unbelievable because no one believes that these people are in any danger with creatures that look like they were made on an early 90s computer nonetheless this movie is actually pretty funny the creatures are so clunky looking and the actors really give it their all pretending like they're in danger br br i'd like to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh <UNK> but i can't this pg 13 rated film actually <UNK> itself out every time a curse word comes a parrot noise <UNK> out the word even words that can be said on network television how <UNK> ing cheap that they <UNK> out words and with a parrot no less eventually these parrot noises got to me and i couldn't help but laugh at the incompetence br br this movie is bad from the silly beginning to the ridiculous night of the living dead style ending but it's also kind of funny as a horror movie it fails miserably as an action movie it fails slightly less but still pretty bad and as a comedy it shines br br my rating out of 95 mins pg 13 for some violence and out <UNK>
<START> what a terrible sequel the reason i give this film two stars instead of zero because it's a movie that has violence and gore and <UNK> yet it is planned out poorly and this god awful sequel was done by none other than bum bum bum bum mick <UNK> the <UNK> that brought you the remake of the shining which nearly got kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made <UNK> is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of the fly the fly which was a wonderful movie but <UNK> movie nearly ruined john <UNK> career anyway if you really want to see the crappy <UNK> trilogy in order don't that's the mistake i made rent the first one or the third one or better yet don't <UNK> to that level at all this movie sucked so bad that i can't believe it please avoid this crap shame on you mick
<START> i'm very disappointed first of all the german <UNK> is bad maybe in the original version with subtitles it would have been better but the whole movie looks like if the director saw <UNK> <UNK> and black cat white cat and tried to produce something in this style too but failed in every aspect it's an <UNK> mixture of a weird unbelievable story and very childish gags no atmosphere no life extremely primitive sex humor i voted 2 because 1 is the worst and the other point for she's really cute sorry i like movies but this one is really superfluous
<START> the seasoned actors in this do know how to act and have proved that before but the director who also wrote and produced this travesty is incompetent on so many levels o k it's low budget but i know films students with lower budgets and lesser known actors who can do much much better for example since there were people involved who should know better some of the gun <UNK> were totally out of place and never existed in those days the stunt work was clumsy the story stale and hokey if some one gives you a copy of this use it for a coaster by the way i love westerns and have known many stunt men and even went to high school with one of the actors so i was looking for it to be good
<START> david <UNK> copied <UNK> and such an <UNK> copy the film isn't even 1 2 as funny or amusing as the original it's boring with forced stories like the lara track of having a child and no <UNK> plus there is an <UNK> stupid don and david tries to choke drama too but the film looks disjointed boring br br songs just pop in so does romance and everything <UNK> some funny govinda scenes the dance before <UNK> nothing else is worth mentioning the last few scenes are quite funny but there tend to get too long br br david's direction is as bad as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he needs to change his style or attempt something good music is saving grace some songs are good but the situations seem forced br br govinda looks overweight and seems too loud and screams his lines in initial <UNK> but he gets into the groove and gives his best in the office and the scene with salman in his cabin and towards the end br br salman just plays himself and his <UNK> tone plus his fake style of acting is a headache br br lara is <UNK> <UNK> is fake as usual br br the kid overacts
<START> this movie was terrible it was so very terrible br br most annoying was the way the trial was <UNK> the defense attorney is allowed to <UNK> on and on when questioning a witness without the <UNK> making any <UNK> he attacks the children brought to give <UNK> with cruel and repeatedly yells at them that they're lying these just aren't things that they subject children who have been sexually abused to the trial is silly and it ruins the whole movie law order has spoiled me for courtroom accuracy <UNK>
<START> the great james cagney top billed in big letters doesn't show up till the movie's second third and probably has less screen time than dudley <UNK> who plays the <UNK> <UNK> school <UNK> but when jimmy arrives as a deputy <UNK> of something or other out to <UNK> <UNK> schools he <UNK> the air with his hands and jumps on the balls of his feet and <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> first national dialogue with all the <UNK> and expected <UNK> the psychology in this crisp <UNK> one of <UNK> many efforts to <UNK> its place as the socially conscious studio doesn't run deep <UNK> is bad just because the script requires him to be and there's the quaint notion that juvenile <UNK> will turn into <UNK> kids if they're just given a dash of <UNK> but it's made in that spare fast style that the studio <UNK> in and it never <UNK> frankie <UNK> who got into all kinds of <UNK> trouble during a brief <UNK> as <UNK> favorite rotten street kid is an ideal <UNK> a handsome charismatic <UNK> with a <UNK> nose and a hate filled stare that could <UNK> steel no kid actor today can touch him
<START> not confusing in the sense that gee this movie is really complex and thus hard to follow but confusing in the sense that gee this movie really has no idea what it's doing br br dream of a warrior is a hong kong south korean collaboration but it's all utter nonsense a movie about parallel <UNK> mixed in with time travel mixed in with love story mixed in with silliness br br the film has the type of concept that <UNK> the mind again not <UNK> the mind because it's so great and complex but <UNK> in the sense that it's so ridiculous and one can't <UNK> of anyone ever coming up with such an awful premise to begin with br br nothing in dream of a warrior makes sense and that's because the whole movie should never have been made it is quite awful the only saving grace is the actress who plays the female warrior not the female lead br br 3 out of 10
<START> it is so bad i can not tear myself away i keep asking myself why why with every scene br br there is no continuity but then again if you want to make a very overtly homosexual movie with a <UNK> attitude towards all things big big <UNK> big boys big planes then you don't have to worry about things like plot or character i am <UNK> and very concerned that the looks so much like richard <UNK> it seems wrong to put a <UNK> look alike in such a terrible movie but i can't tear myself away this movie is the first movie i've ever reviewed that is how <UNK> bad and bizarre it is it motivated me to join this site i have counted 50 main characters perhaps if i was stoned i could follow this but as it is i feel like i'm in some kind of never ending bad dream where it is always 1988 and we were the greatest on earth
<START> i didn't see this movie when it originally came out but there has been a couple songs sharing the title and the term still gets used from time to time and i figured there must be something to the flick so i <UNK> it up and gave a view now i would like the <UNK> hour and forty five minutes of my life back it seemed much longer there was nothing particularly bad about the movie the acting was good no large plot holes of course there wasn't much plot to have holes in there just wasn't a lot to the movie there was some chemistry between the two but nothing compelling about their relationship nothing interesting about their story near the end when he attempts to chase down the train to catch his fleeing romance neither my wife nor i wanted him to catch her honestly we figured they were better off with out each other and if they did get back together we really didn't care so what's that say about this love story when even a 25 year old sappy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship i should have left this one in the missed category br br logan www com <UNK>
<START> this is one of my three all time favorite movies my only <UNK> is that the director peter <UNK> had too many cuts showing the actors <UNK> instead of together as a scene but the performances were so great i forgive him br br albert finney and tom are absolutely marvelous brilliant the script is great giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during world war ii and therefore what it was like in the 30s as well lots of great subtle touches lots of broad <UNK> <UNK> all of it perfectly done scene after scene just blows me away and then there's the heartbreaking climax
<START> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it has also given us watchable films such as and the odd angry shot unfortunately for everyone involved in this <UNK> the boy won't be joining appearing in either list br br i was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on bbc 2 late at night the <UNK> didn't even mention the movie's name so i was expecting something so <UNK> <UNK> that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief it did drop in disbelief i found myself not being able to believe that the <UNK> thought this was going to be a major international hit br br the problem lies with the cast and the script i do know that australia with its small population doesn't have a large pool of actors so i'll be <UNK> for the most part but this doesn't stop my criticism of nick as steve for this type of comedy to work you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor and i'm sorry to say but nick g just doesn't have the skills i'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he's been in so perhaps he's much better at other performances here however he's just plain irritating unconvincing and i lost count at the number of times he <UNK> for the camera the jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and getting back to the script it seems very under developed i mean who thought a running gag about a female of work who's having it off in the back of a <UNK> was funny to begin with you do get the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said look mate this <UNK> not nearly good enough go and make it more subtle and structured br br i've been harsh and <UNK> has been called for in this review i gave the movie four out of ten and it would have only got three if it wasn't for the one genuinely funny sequence where steve is watching a current affairs show only for himself flashing up on screen and <UNK> a <UNK> this shows that the screenwriters were aware of comic timing and social comment such a pity that they didn't come with a much better written movie
<START> as a documentary this is laughable in a campy sort of way a <UNK> collection of re created biblical <UNK> mixed in with <UNK> interviews of so called experts think of it as an which pushes jesus instead of <UNK> masters br br however the detailed <UNK> scene is in terms of historical accuracy superior to similar scenes in such widescreen hollywood <UNK> as ben <UNK> king of kings and the greatest story ever told rather than dragging his entire cross to for example john simply carries his <UNK> across his shoulders to his <UNK> arms nails aren't driven through his <UNK> but instead through his <UNK> his feet aren't nailed <UNK> but one is placed over the other so that just one nail need be used incidentally <UNK> prior to his <UNK> ranks <UNK> in the book <UNK> the hundred great scenes of men being whipped in the movies br br of course and the two thieves wear modest which probably isn't true to the shameful reality of roman <UNK> but <UNK> must be made curiously the good thief is <UNK> on the left hand of jesus which goes against a long standing tradition just why this thief is played by a <UNK> overweight man is however a mystery especially in view of the fact that the bad thief is something of a hunk
<START> ok why complain about this movie it's fiction deal with it if you want to see the biography go watch it this is an original <UNK> version of what happened in <UNK> people who are obsessed will complain about this as they do every other <UNK> of the facts sad but true i think making kane <UNK> the man in which the film is named after was a great idea i thought it wasn't so good at first i'll be honest but that just made it even scarier if you like kane <UNK> ed <UNK> or movies based on real events i think this is a good movie but if you're obsessed like some other people stay away from this movie and all others
<START> watched this film with an audience of 5 in total had a choice between <UNK> and realized then i should have gone for <UNK> a typical plot india v <UNK> but just isn't <UNK> as you have <UNK> in the middle an indian super hero goes on a mission to save the president of india from some <UNK> rebels who are involved in a mass drug <UNK> <UNK> i left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place the songs were also awful the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects but unfortunately they are outdated too br br overall avoid it if you can has to be the worst film i've seen this year
<START> this movie has a few good performances going for it and that's all it has going for it the leads especially <UNK> are appealing although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a <UNK> the material that is the problem i feel as though the screenwriter director watched the entire run of <UNK> in one sitting then sat down to write a script without catching any sleep it really did remind me of <UNK> a thoughtful young woman finding herself finding love with a shake them up and see what happens approach to the characters and their relationships except that while i usually enjoyed watching <UNK> this movie left me cold the writing is just awful it's amazing that the cast could come off as well as they did as the dialogue is dull at best at its worst it becomes trite stilted and amateurish there is nothing original here with plot elements recycled from gimmicks that weren't so brilliant to begin with angels and fortune <UNK> come on for the first half of the movie i <UNK> for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience by the second half i just wished for it to end already my <UNK> to the cast who deserved a better vehicle for their talents
<START> those wishing to see film noir remakes should not see this as as a remake you will always be disappointed instead enjoy a gripping performance from dennis quaid and visual imagery to <UNK> the colour <UNK> from the film literally not <UNK> as the plot <UNK> pace and the dialogue is crisp and gritty the opening dialogue is clever and the viewer is carried along by a sharp screenplay and a real original film noir feel
<START> no no no no my entire being is revolting against this dreadful remake of a classic movie i knew we were heading for trouble from the moment meg ryan appeared on screen with her ridiculous hair and clothing literally looking like a scarecrow in that garden she was digging meg ryan playing meg ryan how tiresome is that and it got worse so much worse the horribly cliché lines the stock characters the increasing sense i was watching a spin off of the first wives club and the ultimate hackneyed <UNK> in the delivery room how many times have i seen this movie only once but it feel like a dozen times nothing original or fresh about it for shame
<START> focus is an engaging story told in urban wwii era setting william macy portrays <UNK> who is taken out of his personal circumstances and challenged with decisions testing his values affecting the community laura dern macy and david <UNK> give good performances so also the good supporting ensemble
<START> i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time i have seen it well over 100 times actually had to buy a new copy as a result of it is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in i highly recommend to anyone wanting to <UNK> the high schools days again buy a copy now it is a classic
<START> 1980 is brilliant it's got all these qualities that made the late 70's movies so great it is proud of its <UNK> and not ashamed of being over the top br br what really matters here is the journey not the destination ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality will never realize that is about the struggles <UNK> and <UNK> of these young people not about their careers br br ironically enough none of the very talented actors of made it in hollywood marked the end of an era the end of artistic freedom and <UNK> and the beginning of <UNK> and political correctness it's the last statement of a generation that had a voice of its own br br 10 10
<START> this is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night if you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you the <UNK> of a real cult classic it has everything you would want to see in a horror movie a beautiful girl a hero the <UNK> a monster truck and of course a family of mutant satanic killers this one is full of blood guts and gore i strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of monster <UNK> bad but funny one liners and our hero eating eye ball <UNK> not as good as the evil dead but a close second just remember warning do not eat before viewing this film
<START> <UNK> is a <UNK> film about well <UNK> and his army of kung fu killer women led by queen <UNK> he fights to get his club the total experience back from willie green by <UNK> their kung fu abilities and their devotion to him i liked this movie because of the witty dialogue and also the use of <UNK> ray moore's ability to <UNK> to his brothers in rhyme
<START> kramer vs kramer is a near <UNK> drama about shocking <UNK> of the two subjects of a failed married couple meryl streep in the <UNK> of her trademark <UNK> sensitivity plays an unhappy stay at home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her <UNK> husband in a fantastic performance by dustin hoffman to find another role for herself hoffman is <UNK> having absolutely no idea what to do with himself having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning br br hoffman <UNK> <UNK> this husband as such a <UNK> load of <UNK> he is restless relentless and <UNK> but even though the positive side to those three <UNK> should include just the opposite he is <UNK> <UNK> on whatever he turns his head to he's been focused on his career in advertising and when he is left to raise his son billy all by himself chaos in immediately he's the one throwing temper <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> halfway through an activity after awhile as he befriends his neighbor and former friend played by sexy jane alexander hoffman his <UNK> enough to understand why his wife left in the meantime his <UNK> energy towards raising billy and he loses his job br br the custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey <UNK> even if the ending is a little <UNK> for the audience the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to <UNK> after the magical 1970s
<START> for years i've had a distant memory of watching this film i looked on the net to find it somewhere and couldn't find it anywhere so i thought it must have disappeared br br until my <UNK> showed me a box set she sent off for in the daily mail and i though <UNK> there wont be anything decent in there but to my great surprise there amongst other gems was the water babies i hadn't been that excited <UNK> long long time its a great light hearted film the songs aren't memorable probably if i was a child during the time it came out i would have stuck in my mind more sadly it was just a film i watched at my 10 years ago when i was a little <UNK> and watching it back now the animation is terrible and the re <UNK> voices they do to get a <UNK> to the sound in films is totally off but who cares when your a kid you never think of those things even if they lead boy is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of <UNK> br br great classic kids film
<START> i was in this movie as an extra in the dallas filming in july 1975 some of the things you see today and take for granted in movie making were <UNK> in this movie the movie premise the costumes the special effects the acting it all was ahead of its time it opened the door for movies such as star wars the terminator the matrix and x men movies now people look at it and they say well this does not add up to this new special effects story it did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days it did have a story and a wonderful cast and a hell of a director the places it was filmed like the world trade center and the building and the <UNK> worth water gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film the director michael anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and it was my first film experience the first of six films i have been in just because it was filmed in texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of <UNK> art watch it again and appreciate it more this movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy well my hand is <UNK> i got to run <UNK>
<START> i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space br br the story begins much like any other mario game mario receives a letter from princess <UNK> <UNK> him to a celebration at her castle in the <UNK> kingdom upon arriving at <UNK> castle mario finds <UNK> and his son <UNK> jr attacking the castle with their <UNK> <UNK> kidnaps princess <UNK> and then lifts her castle up into space in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet mario is found by a talking star named and is taken back to the home a floating space station here mario meets many other and also meets their leader a woman named <UNK> <UNK> tells mario that <UNK> has taken away the space <UNK> power stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to mario to help the find them and save <UNK> thus the adventure begins br br the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other <UNK> each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic mario <UNK> the best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the is used in many unique ways in this game you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well <UNK> the shooting stars you can also point the remote at the screen and use the <UNK> to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the <UNK> it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some <UNK> games br br my only minor <UNK> is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you <UNK> at 4 lives still these minor problems aside it's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging this is the type of game that we've been waiting for on the <UNK> br br a perfect 10 out of 10
<START> this is absolutely the best 80s cartoon ever maybe the best cartoon of all time it had everything action adventure thrill and much more br br i can't imagine how hard it was for ruby spears company to make this great cartoon there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it for example just the <UNK> down scenes were hard because i wouldn't call the 1980s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the <UNK> down scenes were excellent br br the cartoons will never be the same as they were before that is why i hope that they all will be released on dvd specially the as it's my favorite i have the whole complete set of <UNK> episodes on dvd r but it's not the same because if they were released on dvd the people in the world would be able to buy it and see the dvd's in almost every store which means a lot to the fans my good friend ted made this <UNK> to either get the show back on tv or better on dvd that is if we get many <UNK> to get them back on dvd br br so please help us by <UNK> the <UNK> at http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK>
<START> for a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million this little movie that could deserves a <UNK> we award interesting premise aside from the usual meteor stuff with solid by a cast of familiar faces 2 thumbs up advice to the other reviewer don't be afraid to say you liked something
<START> <UNK> visconti the artist with the sword courage should be the first word associated with his entire <UNK> film theater music <UNK> artistic cultural personal a legacy with powerful consequences and endless <UNK> he introduced the <UNK> through the work of an american novelist james cain in he gave anna <UNK> the most extraordinarily beautiful close ups of her career he gave us <UNK> <UNK> and maria but the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain adam low and the voice of <UNK> <UNK> what a terrible fate br br for those interested there is a <UNK> minute documentary by director <UNK> a man who really knew visconti titled <UNK> visconti a portrait it is out on dvd distributed by image entertainment
<START> as long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a <UNK> <UNK> and not intended as a serious release it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is i even liked the theme music br br and if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by joel or mike and the mst3k <UNK> this is it watch this with a bunch of smart ass wise <UNK> and you're in for a good time have a <UNK> <UNK> up some large <UNK> and enjoy br br of course <UNK> a copy requires buying a <UNK> or <UNK> it as but if you're here on the imdb then you're most likely <UNK> enough to do so good luck br br and look for my favorite part where dr doom informs the <UNK> that they have 12 hours to <UNK> with his wishes and he actually gestures the number 12 with his finger while doing so it's like evil <UNK> street <UNK> boy br br and of course mrs storm <UNK> just look at you the four is just so heartwarming you'll laugh you'll cry br br so if you love <UNK> sci fi this one's fantastic for you
<START> the critics were like a movie that will break your heart etc so a friend of mine and i had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie br br i'll make it short and leave it up to others to write about its content this movie tries to touch you to reach your heart but it fails at least for me and for my friend too br br everything that happened happened only on the screen it was always there not here where i am i thought most of the time hmm <UNK> happening on the screen but it's only on the screen it's not real br br movies which succeeded much better in touching me east of <UNK> 1955 terms of <UNK> 1983 jerry maguire 1996 babe 1995 <UNK> 2002
<START> i rarely shut a movie off after the first 10 minutes but that is what i did with this one what turned me off was it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin of as many b actresses as possible and nothing else really matters br br don't get me wrong i like pretty actresses and sex scenes and <UNK> movies have their own scale of merits but this director does nothing else right br br for example take the scene where the two cops of course one guy one gal and of course there is all this supposedly witty banter between them are talking over while standing over the first dead body the camera pans between them for each line there's more than one screen <UNK> between them and you end up wondering whether you're <UNK> from that or the clueless dialog br br well it might have gotten better after the first 10 minutes but i wouldn't know i <UNK> the sucker bet and found something better to do
<START> imagine 24 completely <UNK> given free license to explain the situation in any detail needed and showing how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill prevent and you have an idea of how good this tv series is people in the us have known for a long time that showtime is the new hbo they are making far better cutting edge powerful shows and this is no exception the show takes the viewer all the way through the creation of a sleeper cell to when an attack is attempted taking in important <UNK> such as faith religion funding means and needs to the <UNK> there is much to be <UNK> about the muslim faith here unlike on mainstream shows like 24 where the terrorists are merely <UNK> who the good guys shoot their purpose and <UNK> here are fully examined what gives the show more <UNK> is the latest technology the cell fbi uses and the authentic shots in europe the us and the middle east no expense is <UNK> to tell the story accurately the cast are relatively <UNK> but the acting is superb with the aid of a <UNK> written script that constantly keeps the viewer on edge with many unexpected twists and turns this show has not got the credit it deserves and ironically is a bit of a sleeper hit itself must see for anyone at all interested in this genre
<START> the fact that this <UNK> series could <UNK> dozens of comments much less hundreds of speaks volumes as to the decline of western or at least american civilization br br read <UNK> you morons or at least dave barry or <UNK> and <UNK> br br chuck norris wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes <UNK> hours viewing this poor <UNK> <UNK> the boards and <UNK> lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service br br please don't watch this show spare your few remaining brain cells
<START> a good idea let down by heavy handed production br br quite a bit of the dialogue was <UNK> because of the level of music background sound and this didn't help this reviewer nor did the <UNK> accents pretty <UNK> at times towards the end i lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue br br this movie didn't know whether to be a farce or a black comedy and they require different approaches some of the incidents were laid on so thick that they only <UNK> a <UNK> some were so unbelievable even for this sort of plot that they made the story just not worth following br br the acting was in the main good although the american just came over as a clone of the back to the future mad scientist the little boy was very good br br i did watch it all the way through but god knows why i can't remember laughing once
<START> the things that i find irritating on screen the things i <UNK> about and annoy the people who try to watch movies with me are those moment where the writer director set designer on screen <UNK> or whoever doesn't think it through to the end and by a single act of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> all the other work done by everyone else who has worked on the movie that moment of wait a bloody minute what just happened that stops the narrative dead in its tracks not that this film's narrative needed a lot of stopping because anyone who has ever seen it will know that narrative drive has pretty well frozen solid before the end of the opening shot there are several of those moments in this movie and you get so long to think about them too the film is two hours long and the scripted dialogue probably ran to five pages there's a lot of time to <UNK> its <UNK> br br the movie is set in a frozen earth another ice age has set in and the whole world is dying it's cold very cold it's actually very cold on the screen the movie was shot in canada in winter and there are <UNK> and real snow and people's breath <UNK> from their mouths in every scene time and again we are reminded how cold it is people wear big hats and layers and layers of clothes and <UNK> around like over dressed people must have been a horrible shoot my <UNK> comes in a sequence when our hero <UNK> into a room of a hotel <UNK> up in the middle of the night by voices coming from the room next door he <UNK> a conversation of vital importance to the <UNK> plot through an large <UNK> in the wall <UNK> the two rooms i'm not questioning why there is a convenient <UNK> in the wall between the two rooms what got me annoyed was the fact that the <UNK> had not been <UNK> up by the long term tenant with the <UNK> visitor if you are trying to keep warm the last thing you need is a huge <UNK> hole in your wall that leads into an <UNK> <UNK> room trust me i live like this i watched this film sat on my living room <UNK> under a <UNK> with a hot water bottle my breath was <UNK> as much as the actors' if that <UNK> great hole was in my wall i'd block it up with something maybe not the best choice of movie to watch in an <UNK> room in <UNK> but boy did it make me notice the lousy <UNK> in the film
<START> j s <UNK> directed a little known <UNK> <UNK> in 1982 called the <UNK> and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films including the rubbish 2001 vampire movie the <UNK> his latest feature film wicked little things boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster that i seem to remember <UNK> a couple of years ago in relation to a film that tobe hooper was meant to direct well i guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie <UNK> movie and so turned this one down i don't blame him for it either the plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once <UNK> to her late husband however what they don't realise is that around a hundred years earlier a group of children that were being used as <UNK> were trapped down a <UNK> naturally that's not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now <UNK> the area in search of br br the film is essentially a collection of clichés from the youngest kid with an imaginary friend the mother who <UNK> it and all the usual zombie rubbish j s <UNK> attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes mostly involving kids but its not enough the story doesn't play out very well at all either and really did remind me too much of the earlier <UNK> and that's not a good thing although <UNK> is actually a better film than this one the acting is nothing to write home about either <UNK> is decent looking as is <UNK> daughter <UNK> taylor <UNK> but neither manages to provide an interesting performance chloe is slightly better than the usual child actor the plot is given hardly any credibility and indeed the screenplay can't even be bothered to explain the reasons why the kids attack the locals it all <UNK> down to a typical and rather dull ending and overall i have to say that if you know your horror movies then you can feel free to skip this one
<START> catherine is a french director who loves to <UNK> her audience she takes us along to witness how a film is done on location the movie in production seems to be based on herself since the person at the center of the story is <UNK> a woman director much like ms <UNK> acts as the alter ego of the real director br br <UNK> reaches an <UNK> at the start of filming not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras <UNK> has problems with the two principal actors especially the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie the lead actress is no angel either br br movie making ms tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art first there is the writing period in which in this case <UNK> has written a screen play that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer director didn't think about there is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact what appeared clever in the written page doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera the actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man br br the <UNK> anne is marvelous as <UNK> the director she makes observations about the production the actors and the crew that fit well into the story being told <UNK> colin and play the lead actors with all the <UNK> that some actors bring to a movie set <UNK> has to <UNK> their <UNK> in order to get what she wants in the end ashley plays leo assistant br br sex is comedy allows ms to give us her own take on films in general this is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical style
<START> i recently purchased this on dvd as i hadn't heard of it and like robert <UNK> br br obviously this movie is not going to have hollywood blockbuster special effects in saying that though the special effects were decent enough and the acting was fine also br br i found the movie to be enjoyable and do not regret buying it at all at almost 2 hours long it is just the right length for this type of movie br br do not expect thrilling explosive action from beginning to end though it is a fairly well balanced movie with a decent enough storyline
<START> this movie was one of the worst i have ever seen not including anything by or with <UNK> shore i couldn't believe that a film could actually be this bad br br <UNK> has to be the single worst actor again not including <UNK> shore to ever star in a movie the temptation to hit the stop button during this movie was huge in fact if there was a throw in the trash button on my vcr i would have been inclined to press that br br do yourself a favor and do something more interesting than watch this movie like watching the grass grow or watching golf on tv
<START> this is the fourth full length feature film by marc by the third <UNK> mans empty hands i promised myself not to cut my <UNK> anymore but this time round the plot is completely different a kind of homage to <UNK> 1940 2001 a <UNK> journalist the visuals in the trailer are stunning a <UNK> river <UNK> in <UNK> and the promise that marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother none of both professional actors convinced me at last six weeks after its release abandon yourself in this very unusual road river film learn almost nothing about <UNK> but his most poignant legacy his constant fight against <UNK> of what we chose to forget <UNK> de look for battle of the at the <UNK> was lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half hearted democracy nobody has done much to remember the legitimate side of the spanish civil war and those who fought it this film is about the lonely people <UNK> the same places with very little conscience of what took place there 70 years ago this film is about the landscape
<START> i suggest that in the future any movie made by the sci fi channel and subsequently released on dvd must say that it was indeed made by such channel as i would not buy this stuff if i had known this fact not that this was all bad but when you have fade out for commercials in the middle of your movie it just ruins the flow of said film this in turn makes the movie rather more boring this one had an interesting story however the light hearted and extremely generic soundtrack distracted one from the film as did most of the bad actors with the exception of <UNK> and linda carter the story vampires are on the attack in south america of course the rules of vampire movies are not in effect which the usually aren't in any of the movies about vampires i have seen lately with the exception of the blade trilogy group of soldiers are sent down to battle said squad another team is sent to meet up with the team and to track down the ex wife of one of the soldiers why she is not just his wife who knows as this part of the plot really goes no where still we get an interesting boat ride some nice jungle scenery and a lot of blood this fact however does not save the film from being way to jerky in its presentation and really dull seeming at times i don't know maybe it was the cgi blood and smoke and whatever they have to make cgi now even though old effects look better and don't cost that much more i mean cheap italian zombie movies could do a bullet hole without cgi why can't we now
<START> the story has little to do with jack <UNK> original novel i thought the acting was very unnatural the dubbing was done very <UNK> and the story itself contains a fairly large number of inconsistencies and loose ends apart from that the pace of the movie was <UNK> slow at some parts
<START> jean pierre <UNK> is a director i've only recently gotten <UNK> with i need to see bob le and le <UNK> again to fully grasp them but in watching le <UNK> the red circle supposedly based on a saying in <UNK> i realized i was watching as <UNK> and absorbing a crime film as i had seen in a quite some time though his film has dialog it is mainly to keep the film's scenes rolling along <UNK> to the plot what kept me on the alert even in seemingly mundane scenes sequences was the emphasis on the characters' movements or behavior <UNK> <UNK> has his story laid out and he is careful to take his time to tell it this could seem boring to some but it does seem to work since he puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters <UNK> over plot br br yet look at each of the four main players <UNK> <UNK> as corey just released from prison scheming a new heist <UNK> maria as <UNK> escaping on the <UNK> from hand <UNK> custody meets corey by luck <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> an aged pro with many years of experience with weapons a friend of <UNK> and andre as mattei an experienced investigator who is on the look out for <UNK> and on his <UNK> with internal affairs each of these actors plays their parts with <UNK> <UNK> and they each have their own kinds of moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities might be besides as criminals and cops the heist sequence gives little hints for example like how <UNK> cops a feel off a female statue while passing down the <UNK> or how <UNK> takes out a <UNK> and merely has a <UNK> of the <UNK> and what a dream this guy creates even <UNK> movements involving a photograph of a woman <UNK> interest br br as absorbing and cool the story becomes and as great the skills were to make it happen via cinematographer <UNK> the editing and the musical score by eric it's the people on the screen that gain fascination in how they stay true to their <UNK> and ideals not a film to be missed by french new wave <UNK> and modern day crime movie buffs might want to take the <UNK> minutes to <UNK> up the atmosphere of <UNK> work a suave piece of film making that still ranks as one of my all time favorites
<START> i saw this series on <UNK> in 1980 in college and i still can't get it out of my head although i have never seen it since i remember every cast member the casting was perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original roots
<START> let me start off by saying i love japanese cinema literature and culture generally i've seen many japanese movies and enjoyed them but portrait of hell aka makes itself ridiculous the two characters who dominate the action the evil lord in his <UNK> bubble and the stubborn crazy artist are pure types with zero subtlety or nuance and all their actions from cartoonish extremes the film wants to show horrible scenes of violence and raw emotion but many of these scenes are so over the top they actually become laughable and the overall feeling is that of a made for tv movie that went off the <UNK> if this rarely screened movie falls in your hands or comes to your town spare yourself and give it a pass
<START> if you want to see a true thriller rent this it's not from the director or screenwriter of scream doesn't feature overacting <UNK> tv actors passing off as stars and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza instead you'll get a top notch edgy very strong in violence yet thrilling
<START> first of all i would like to <UNK> that i consider this one of the funniest films i have ever seen i have watched it almost 10 times just because i've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless <UNK> of this film to other unsuspecting victims it has the captivating essence of a hand held camera recording of a distant <UNK> seventh birthday it has all the writing of a wwe match and most of all it has the <UNK> of a face <UNK> along a sidewalk this movie is a masterpiece br br the film begins with an almost <UNK> <UNK> of three drunken teens in the desert this scene convinced me that i was onto something big when i picked this film from the dvd rack being drawn to the box because of the graphic of a <UNK> yelling the word <UNK> on the front of it the scene contains such <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> spaghetti intestines vain attempts at humour and <UNK> dinosaur puppets that repeat throughout the course of the movie this movie is a masterpiece br br the film contains <UNK> backdrops and prop use that causes one's mind to melt at the thought that someone could just have so little shame when it comes to creating a film an example is when a truck in the middle of the night is <UNK> beside a cliff wall the very next day they find it in an open area the driver couldn't have driven it there since he had his face bitten off by an <UNK> i will explain why it's <UNK> in a second so my only guess is that either the <UNK> drove it the <UNK> the driver was <UNK> did it or jim <UNK> doesn't think very highly of his viewers hell in one part they expect me to believe that they are walking down a main street at night when the road doesn't have <UNK> the fire is <UNK> placed next to a phone booth and there's only a single street light yet still i feel compelled to watch and re watch this film just so i can find more things that will make me giggle the next time i watch it this film is a masterpiece br br the directing on this film is horrific long extended pauses strange cuts to characters that weren't even in the general <UNK> of the conversation people discussing things casually while facing the camera and in turn making them face the wall they can't even give the dinosaur a coherent species flipping between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber <UNK> puppet distinguished by the intensely long fat <UNK> claw this film is a masterpiece br br the editing is prominent on this film this is not a good thing i am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films masterfully crafted into a single piece of crap but there has to be a limit sub plots end as abruptly as they began explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not being limited to well not being explained at all and an ending that felt like driving a muscle car into a brick wall without a seat belt you just never know what is going to happen because the film doesn't follow a coherent structure this film is a masterpiece br br now i'm going to just have to mention a single scene the greatest one that occurs near the end this is a spoiler but not really the final scene contains a showdown between <UNK> rex and sheriff <UNK> it is like the showdown between <UNK> weaver and the alien queen in aliens except without all the emotional power budget epic battling it pretty consists of <UNK> <UNK> the dinosaur with a piece of construction <UNK> a white <UNK> in a space of several minutes through a series of <UNK> slipped in cuts the director manages to turn that white <UNK> into a yellow <UNK> <UNK> looking piece of <UNK> now as i said i know that this film is made from scenes from other films but what two films warrant a showdown with a t rex in a construction vehicle this film is a masterpiece br br this film gets a 1 10 for quality of film making but a 10 10 for how much it makes me laugh and enjoy myself
<START> anyone who has seen the piece of steaming <UNK> poo called <UNK> understands my title and i feel for you this movie wasn't just bad it was painful the book was stupid the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible dylan walsh <UNK> has it julia roberts dumped your ass cause this movie blew so bad huge <UNK> killer <UNK> talking <UNK> hmmm sounds like a hit oh tim accent is so bad in this movie i would prefer being deaf i recommend this movie to <UNK> looking to <UNK> after a heavy meal or patients who just need that one more reason to die if this is faithful to the book i would say lets have us a good old fashion <UNK> book burning and destroy every copy if future generations look back and find this garbage how would we explain ourselves listen to the others who hated this movie don't watch it run away do not watch this movie if you think it is full of action or suspense or cool effects you are wrong if you think it blows more <UNK> than nicole ritchie you'd be right so if you still are going to watch <UNK> i mean <UNK> i say do it after you just took 50 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the director loves the actress and it shows the actress <UNK> the character whom we love at first sight and sound the character loves her jealous husband and he loves her his childhood friend secretly loves his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes the love tragic and ironic his wife is jealous of his childhood friend and thinks her <UNK> are out of secret love for her husband br br then there is a murder and the investigating police lieutenant who loves only his <UNK> racial son and <UNK> being taken from his company by the above characters who have had some unpleasant contact with the deceased and are all lying to one degree or another <UNK> the mystery with some of the most precise and authentic <UNK> detail ever captured on film br br and then there are the <UNK> of a post war paris where coal is in short supply music is filled with erotic longing and <UNK> memory and innocence has long ago been washed away by the rain br br all of this in a <UNK> of <UNK> whose tricks don't always work dogs who walk on their <UNK> feet and express music criticism hungry news <UNK> and exhausted cops br br and then there are many of the finest actors of their generation who have been through some very bad years directed by to come full circle a man who is in love with his lead actress and who with full justification was a respected friend of <UNK> br br i've seen this film often and i love all of them and it
<START> <UNK> is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography for this alone the film is well worth one's time the stark wide open <UNK> and <UNK> of eastern montana are captured in the spare muted earth tones of <UNK> or early spring the gigantic grey <UNK> <UNK> peck <UNK> is the film's protagonist the film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of western landscape the dialogue can be trying at times yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film the 1950's period works so well here and is executed so well i think that the passing years will be kind to this film
<START> thirty years prior to the deer hunter came this movie an excellent <UNK> on the effects of war inflicted on the american family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives a truly ironic title the best years of our lives is anything but since those times have <UNK> into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved br br truly an ensemble cast despite the top billing of myrna loy the best years of our lives focuses more on the stories of the men al <UNK> march comes back to a household that has <UNK> changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his <UNK> wife <UNK> myrna loy fred <UNK> upon returning cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to marie a happy go lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him homer <UNK> on the other hand has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world including the girl he loves and her family thinks he is a freak of nature br br at almost three hours of length the film never seems long and drawn out there is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot <UNK> by nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing not a performance rings false though the <UNK> are those of dana andrews as fred <UNK> harold russell as homer <UNK> and virginia <UNK> as marie <UNK> even then every character has his or her moment on film and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in american films including the ones made around world war one which did not <UNK> in such topics while there is never any overt violence it's all there in the haunted expressions of the three male <UNK> faces in the lot where the planes now <UNK> ready to be turned into junk and therefore in the cynicism of the store owners who couldn't be bothered to employ these shell shocked men who had seen battle or even worse to <UNK> them into wondering what was it all worth for this is the film in which coming home and born on the fourth of july are <UNK> to at a time when america <UNK> from war films to come up with this when the end of the second world war was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest film making
<START> rented the video with a lot of expectations but it was a disappointment the story didn't make sense the plot was very weak and the special effects well i think even i can do better with my home computer sorry missed a change here
<START> i had the misfortune to catch this on a flight recently i had the bigger misfortune of having it played on my return flight as well obviously attempt to get some arty <UNK> the movie is a <UNK> because of her lousy acting ability a better actress might have made this work but a simple look at the face of moore shows the <UNK> within at least she's not ruining american literature this time out
<START> when i saw the preview for this movie i figured to myself here's another dumb tv movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera but when i saw it i was surprised <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stars and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man now and eric close but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community at first she is <UNK> by his <UNK> that he is innocent and her love for him but as time passes she continues to be suspicious of him br br while this sounds like the set up for another boring melodramatic tv movie it is really much better than that because the characters are well acted by <UNK> and close and the movie's script allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than you'd expect these aren't just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist only to move the plot along but real three dimensional people and we find ourselves really caring about them and the movie is smart enough that it is able to provide an exciting involving climax to the story without <UNK> to dumb action scenes mindless cliches or cheap melodrama instead we share in the main character's inner conflicts and fears and are given a realistic portrayal of how she might be able to resolve them and do the right thing br br if you get a chance to give this one a look please do so it's production values are not exactly top notch it is a tv movie after all but if you can look past that there is an excellent story to enjoy
<START> this film is more than the story of it was a joint polish french production filmed at the time of the beginning of the end of the soviet system it probably helped <UNK> the <UNK> union activity it is more about <UNK> in the 20th century than the french revolution <UNK> began the end of the system this film itself is historical by it's very existence the rest is history br br aka <UNK> leaders aka when one watches this film one must remember the <UNK> which began in <UNK> br br actually it could be useful for seeing the <UNK> struggle within the only <UNK> left
<START> i was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script susan sarandon plays the part of a <UNK> irrational and <UNK> mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together she <UNK> her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in hollywood the daughter is dubious but at first she has no choice the bond with mother is <UNK> strong br br in time the girl sees that the mother is off into <UNK> of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground she sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome seductive guy who loves 'em and leaves 'em she sees that the mother doesn't get it so how can she look to her mother for <UNK> br br the mother directs the girl to a drama try out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly by night mother this causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is <UNK> but the lesson takes hold br br there is character growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is <UNK> to let the girl go it is a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parents however emotionally <UNK> have to let the child go and become her own separate person
<START> fate leads walter <UNK> to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number 23 as the story unfolds in real life and fiction <UNK> must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end br br the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is <UNK> by a weak execution the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time the second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful br br joel <UNK> is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker he has the movie <UNK> in style but he just can't get a good focus he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace he switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying the actual book in the film that's titled the number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey <UNK> it which just bored me to tears when carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery at this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension we <UNK> wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished br br the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey was clearly just <UNK> through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts logan <UNK> was pretty bland as was danny huston overall the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills rating 3 10
<START> an epic story of hope <UNK> by budget and limited artistic ambition seeing as <UNK> <UNK> produced this i expected something haunting and lyrical instead we get a typical norwegian co production revolution with al pacino anyone where quite possibly good intentions are <UNK> by a dreadful screenplay and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes the me tarzan you jane english dialogue between the non english speaking protagonists is particularly <UNK>  one could <UNK> whether nick nolte and tim roth ad <UNK> their own as they almost sound like real people the story is loaded with <UNK> we are expected to believe that can speak a <UNK> of english after having spent his entire life living as a <UNK> slave his <UNK> but unfortunately not <UNK> command <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> camp without the benefit of night classes coincidence is <UNK> i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third he tracks down his mother in ho <UNK> city almost immediately after <UNK> into his thirty year younger half brother who <UNK> <UNK> him mum gives him a gold or something similar of great value as they part but this is never referred to again his relationship with me dead inside <UNK> is supposed to provide the obligatory love interest but feels as artificial as <UNK> and cameron in gangs of new york br br the voyage in the <UNK> bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human <UNK> <UNK> indeed the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable is the jerky hand held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions incidentally a boat cruise from <UNK> to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast without stopping for fuel or supplies is certainly an epic journey the beautiful shot of the new york <UNK> echoes <UNK> use of magic hour but i want to know why the coast guard didn't show up perhaps they were watching the super bowl or something of course manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas with the same flair he displayed in ho <UNK> city i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick for <UNK> of how a story about the <UNK> <UNK> could be structured and shot on a small budget check out michael far superior in this world
<START> the first movie of this series was well written and original this show drags on poorly written gags boring flashbacks not the comedy that i expected even the young folks found it boring there are certainly bright moments historical elements and some good acting but overall i can only recommend this for dvd tape at home
<START> is this a bad movie don't take my word for it consider the following press reports of people who tried to watch this movie br br <UNK> while he was watching this movie the brain of mr harold of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> itself from his skull at over 200 and <UNK> to <UNK> across the floor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> mrs louise robbins of <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> year old retired <UNK> committed ritual with a <UNK> knife while watching this movie br br <UNK> ms <UNK> of columbia south <UNK> gave birth to a severely <UNK> baby while watching this movie although she had not been pregnant br br <UNK> while watching this movie together mr and mrs lawrence wells of san <UNK> california <UNK> <UNK> with such force that mr <UNK> left was later found <UNK> in the wall of a house in <UNK> county br br there have been many similar incidents br br of those who did not suffers more serious effects such as those detailed above at least 75 became <UNK> violently and understandably insane after viewing this movie of the remaining 25 most had already been insane before viewing the movie the remainder were either blind and or and deaf or in a <UNK> <UNK> state br br i'm not saying don't rent it if you want to i'm just <UNK> what was in the papers
<START> in the 2nd of his historical martial arts films chiba portrays his real life <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the film even <UNK> incredible feat of killing a raging bull with his bare hands <UNK> did this feat over 50 times in real life dynamic fight choreography featuring authentic techniques ironically this is one of the rare sonny chiba films in which he doesn't tear out or rip off body parts of opponents a must see for sonny chiba fans definitely one of his top 5 films
<START> christopher <UNK> first feature film <UNK> critics who saw it when it first came out shot on a <UNK> budget of 6 000 this is a student film with real class the film is shot in black and white and features people who you assume are friends of <UNK> appearing in the movie this is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good you could see jeremy and alex <UNK> appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago br br <UNK> thriller much like <UNK> does not play <UNK> it shifts the scenes around much like pulp fiction the writing is fantastic it is a great <UNK> thriller but because the <UNK> order of the film is <UNK> around it makes it even more interesting i thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent br br for a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all this is so good it is superior to most that hollywood studios offer and nolan after three films this the superior <UNK> and the not quite as good but still excellent insomnia has <UNK> himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times i can't wait for batman br br this film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch it is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising i also thought that the score from david was also excellent very atmospheric and had a <UNK> quality to it he has gone on to <UNK> <UNK> other films br br overall i would recommend this i intend to get all of <UNK> films this is a low budget gem br br
<START> this movie is over hyped i am sad to say that i manage to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that i will have to force myself real hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie it's totally stupid and very fake the robot in the movie looks like a man wearing those steel suit and the acting is really bad especially the one playing the character alien he is totally annoying don't waste your money watching this sequel to the popular gen x cops i'd rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie 1 out of 10 if possible i'd give 0
<START> like most people i was interested in more solely because of the pink <UNK> soundtrack which has turned out to be the only pink <UNK> album that i still listen to after all these years it was quite a surprise to run across the film in a local video store in a <UNK> <UNK> version it was an even bigger surprise to find that it is a pretty good movie br br visually it is quite beautiful especially when the two main characters are <UNK> on the rocks on the spanish island of <UNK> and the use of the soundtrack music which as far as i can tell is exclusively by pink <UNK> is excellent it was a joy to watch the film with my copy of the album alongside me mentally <UNK> off each track as it was used in the film dave brief a spanish piece was the only one i didn't hear and several tracks are used quite <UNK> especially main theme and <UNK> that latter track is tedious on the soundtrack album but works very well during the title sequence of the film <UNK> at least once later on maybe now i can appreciate it on the album now that i have some visuals to <UNK> it in my mind br br the plot of more is a little hard to take at times especially in the early going when the film appears to be merely a vehicle to demonstrate the <UNK> of those involved in making it but eventually the film proves that it has much more than that to offer as the plot becomes more focused why does <UNK> take heroin why does anybody take heroin fully knowing the possible consequences the film does not attempt to answer that question directly but <UNK> heroin use seems a logical <UNK> of his single minded pursuit of pure pleasure br br i strongly recommend this film to any pink <UNK> fan who has an appreciation of the vastly underrated more soundtrack i also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in sixties <UNK> and how it was portrayed in the media i have no idea how realistic this movie is since i am too young to have experienced the sixties <UNK> but it does seem to capture the spirit of the times in a way that no other movie does
<START> i can't believe that i actually sat thru this entire film a friend rented it because the jacket made it sound good in it's defense the jacket was correct there was a supposed haunted room that someone slept in overnight from the jacket it sounded like this was on par with freddy jason or maybe the shining it couldn't be <UNK> from the truth br br if you are a fan of <UNK> and or <UNK> films you may enjoy it if you're looking for a good fright movie or a couple of thrills go rent jason vs freddy iv you'll have a much better night
<START> might contain spoilers br br ok lets conclude this movie in one word bad two words really bad now why do i think that let me explain br br <UNK> leads a special <UNK> team <UNK> of four persons that get assigned to <UNK> an lethal virus after some arms dealer stole it from a lab they do this by attacking the arm dealers in mid flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting however <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> because one of the terrorist knew his name after <UNK> the team members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved after deciding they cant trust their bosses they decide to once again steal the virus and try to lure out the possible <UNK> br br in theory this is a plot that could have worked in a low budget movie that just aims to be aired on tv however the plot is <UNK> and the movie ruined in several accounts firstly the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes second the acting is really bad or the actors are directed to act as there aren't many emotions change of facial expressions at all etc i was especially disappointed in <UNK> that i believe can do so much more but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough action hero in addition though i am not by any means any expert on the subject i totally believe i could <UNK> a better <UNK> <UNK> team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week this seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and <UNK> as possible this go for good guys bad guys and <UNK> as well then i sincerely doubt the scientific and technical <UNK> if any of the film for example i have <UNK> <UNK> over my hand and i didn't break instantly br br don't know how to conclude this really but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do sorry can't be any <UNK> than that do not watch this movie it is not even so bad it is funny 2 10
<START> this is a 100 improvement over the <UNK> of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time this is a john hughes movie meets the devil's rejects i really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the <UNK> of the series i thought jennifer <UNK> played <UNK> really well and brad <UNK> in <UNK> shoes once again really makes this movie shine actually they're the only good parts of the movie i got rather bored with <UNK> <UNK> and nick scenes it's as if they were thrown in there as a <UNK> and someone to save the day but <UNK> and <UNK> were great to watch and i really liked the black humor to it i thought it made the movie stand out more if you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out br br 7 10
<START> frank clint eastwood is a secret service agent plagued with guilt over the assassination of president john f kennedy while he was on duty thirty years later and the current president is entering a re election campaign but he is receiving death <UNK> and has been called in to assist in what should be a routine research operation john <UNK> plays the professional assassin and master of disguise who is tracking the president and using the past he begins to torture in a psychological duel of cat and mouse br br <UNK> eastwood and <UNK> russo all give wonderful performances in this top notch thriller the direction is excellent and the entire picture is charged with tension and intrigue throughout br br a must see for thriller fans 8 10
<START> here's a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game turkey shoot <UNK> and the running man br br certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work generally bland action sequences a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout br br take for example towards the end of the film when our hero manages to <UNK> the compound of the villains he initially kills a <UNK> and leaves him in his <UNK> upon discovery of the said corpse the villains response bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all  they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the <UNK> br br however i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody <UNK> even if his screen time is very limited br br not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b movie <UNK>
<START> think like a dinosaur was an well produced executed show of the series the actor <UNK> as michael <UNK> plays an <UNK> well and convincing protagonist role you can actually identify yourself with him and his feelings on what to do to the girl whom he has fallen for because he's been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until <UNK> comes to his life with a <UNK> fear of performing the task of being transported he then <UNK> her and let's her know it's all going to be alright which ends up being an deception to both of them more so something bad occurs and she prototype comes back and her clone is sent to the other <UNK> planet although the <UNK> and micheal have yet to find this out when they do it's up to michael to decide to either kill her or to let her live yet what happen to him prior upon meeting her <UNK> was very much related to what happen to his wife his wife died similarly this show <UNK> and sorrow thru out most of it after the show you're left <UNK> about what should have been done and you're stuck with the 50 50 of what's right from wrong hence the balance <UNK> being solely there is no one br br 10 10 highly recommend watching this show
<START> out of the handful of alternative titles in english the is definitely the most appropriate one since this is basically just a shameless rip off of william <UNK> classic horror film in which they replaced 13 year old linda blair with the 19 year old stella only so that she could <UNK> show her ravishing naked body i'm not sure what exactly satan tries to accomplish here but he exclusively seems to possess the young girl to play sexual tricks on her poor <UNK> around the clock and tries to seduce priests and even her own father into having sex with her the young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious <UNK> student with an odd looking boyfriend driving a stupid yellow car and loving albeit <UNK> parents when she takes a peculiar <UNK> home to <UNK> the ancient <UNK> comes to life and no less than satan himself played by <UNK> <UNK> of jungle holocaust and planet of the vampires starts to torment her the overlong masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three quarters of the movie and then finally director mario begins with the actual <UNK> that final segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish the priests don't really do anything apart from saying some vague <UNK> but somehow seems <UNK> all of a sudden there isn't much gore the dialogues are horrible and the producers seem to compensate every little flaw by adding more sleaze this is one of the strangest italian exploitation efforts of the seventies why the hell are they referring to the rocky horror picture show but definitely not one of the best if you fancy <UNK> of the exorcist i recommend demon witch child beyond the door and the <UNK>
<START> while many people found this film simply too slow and simplistic i really connected with it there is no plot as such rather the film takes the form of a human survival story about three people trapped up a tree with a man eating crocodile lurking somewhere in the water beneath them br br personally i thought the acting was mostly very good despite the roles being quite demanding at times and i felt a sense of warmth for the characters the situation they were in was quite terrifying and i really felt nervous for them i found the whole film quite nerve <UNK> because of the sheer <UNK> of their situation and the constant threat to their survival br br the crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film and believe me i have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies the creature moved well and had real menace and although the audience i was with didn't seem too keen on the film as a whole they still jumped and <UNK> whenever the crocodile appeared br br script wise i would have made a few changes particularly towards the end but this was not a major problem for fans of slow burning survival horror set within the <UNK> of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately i think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed
<START> take a cliché story and insert steve <UNK> need i say anymore this truly is as bad as you would expect sheriff tom <UNK> <UNK> and anna attempt to <UNK> a group of useless inept kids into a winning soccer team lacking originality and direction from the <UNK> it's quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film despite my <UNK> about acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than previously <UNK> i thought this type of story of <UNK> battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called <UNK>
<START> with all of <UNK> europe under his control hitler <UNK> for the last <UNK> in his way before heading for north america great britain with an overwhelming edge in aircraft <UNK> looks <UNK> on paper once in the air however the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> by blowing the enemy out of sky air at a seven to one rate the battle of britain <UNK> on for a over a year as the island nation is <UNK> but <UNK> providing crucial time for their american allies to produce more arms for the inevitable struggle br br using more staged footage than the three previous documentaries in the why we fight series the battle of britain has a more propaganda like feel to it with the <UNK> some with <UNK> <UNK> music score scenes <UNK> obvious to <UNK> in an ironic twist amid the <UNK> caused by german air attacks <UNK> seventh <UNK> is employed to <UNK> the visual suffering the story itself is one of remarkable courage by a <UNK> nation who refused to <UNK> under to the devastating attacks inflicted upon it by up until that point an <UNK> war machine it is the 20th century version of the 300 <UNK> br br there have been more <UNK> <UNK> and better looking commercial efforts done on this battle since this film but the <UNK> and motivation the battle of britain provided then will always make it a more valuable document of england during its finest hour
<START> this could have been great the voice overs are exactly right and fit the characters to a t one small problem though the look of the characters mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same the same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as or weight size it looks kind of odd to see a really big guest <UNK> voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here if i am not mistaken kathy <UNK> did a voice over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny br br there is a few other problems one being the family plot the simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into here we get too much annoying <UNK> like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off as you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the simpsons or even more married with children br br if i should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it's <UNK> peter <UNK> is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others lois should have been named lois lame because she is sort of one dimensional seth green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show br br so what more can i say there isn't exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the simpsons has done for almost two decades
<START> i bought this video on a throw out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was <UNK> as an award winning brit sex comedy i guess i should have read the <UNK> print i rarely write a <UNK> review but here goes br br these actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors the theatre going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their <UNK> br br i repeat is the joke about <UNK> the actors' other highly respectable on screen <UNK> with this trashy flick can the reference to the austen classics <UNK> and and <UNK> and <UNK> be anything else how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars are we meant to simply take it as a lay down that all actors are gay and thus letting their on screen affect our <UNK> is accepting their private homosexual <UNK> in our faces too i'm sorry but i don't think so i say no to this one
<START> i saw that this movie was coming out and could not wait to see it i have to say i was very disappointed with it this would have been better as a mini series the whole show seemed very rushed they did not explain things very clearly at the end they showed john paul ii alive and well and the next scene he was dead never any explanation as to what happened we all know what happened in real life i think abc dropped the ball big time on something that could have been great in all i think this movie was a <UNK> it seemed like a drunken monkey jumping around from one point in john paul's life to another point never explaining how or why things happened such as when his older brother leaves it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and that is why he left home also when his father dies all we see is his father lying on the floor and that was that i was very disappointed with the over all movie
<START> although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing <UNK> this remains the best film made about <UNK> the music of max <UNK> is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song <UNK> owen which was a favourite of <UNK> is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de <UNK> flows like in no other off their films together and director <UNK> walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best
<START> there is no denying it sci fi on tv is difficult there are so many problems that the genre brings with it like the need for a good budget solid writing decent acting perhaps the budget and the script writing is the <UNK> where i feel most attempts have failed so does surface succeed not completely but more so than most br br the way i see it a good sci fi show doesn't really need a lot of cgi to work nor does it need a ton of money what it needs is the capacity to create a larger than life feeling the feeling that there is more than meets the eye something to make me curious and willing to try and figure out how it's going to end adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying <UNK> is what makes or breaks a show like this one br br surface had a couple of flaws first of all it's basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been nor is the revealed story as exciting or daring as i hoped in the beginning also the tv feeling is very present much of the time all the way from the crappy cgi that <UNK> from decent to awful to the rather shifting quality in the acting department also it feels sometimes a bit too family oriented in that it takes the edge of sometimes and becomes almost <UNK> but aside from these flaws it's an enjoyable show maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci fi shows out there but it manages to keep me interested the whole season and it offers a couple of nice <UNK> between shows as well the ending for me is not that appealing i don't like shows that end without ending so to speak leaving the story <UNK> it's especially unfortunate in this case since the show seems to be canceled after the first season it is as of yet <UNK> br br hbo is to me the <UNK> for quality television their series have the best actors the best production values and above all the most solid writing this is not hbo quality but it's good for what it is good enough to want another season without a doubt
<START> i first saw this movie in <UNK> new guinea in 1967 and have remembered it since although i have never seen it since that first time br br just how easily good people's lives can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still does is a memory that will haunt me forever br br the movie is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by anthony quinn is superb br br this movie should be in all college studies about man's <UNK> to man
<START> i can't believe this movie has an average rating of 7 0 it is a <UNK> bad movie and i saw it when it was fairly new and i was in the age group that is supposed to like it
<START> so far only the first episode has been shown and a great fuss has been made about the lesbian sex scenes but for those who bother to look past that they will find an incredibly beautiful love story and one that has in this episode ended in an <UNK> climax cliffhanger i have found the story so powerful that i have been inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series has been based
<START> an <UNK> look at the relationship between <UNK> and the space time <UNK> this film the and laws and there relation to <UNK> theory of general <UNK> br br the film is <UNK> directed exposing details of the man <UNK> as well as his work black holes interviews with his family are a little too long so sadly there is less development of his theories and ideas br br a philip glass soundtrack superbly <UNK> the film only one other man could <UNK> such haunting <UNK> jean michel <UNK> br br overall i would highly recommend this movie on the basis of <UNK> of and his adequate explanation of an event horizon
<START> 1 the largest amount of money spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's stomach the ones that were supposed to be intestines 2 ken <UNK> is in it 3 ken <UNK> gets destroyed he doesn't die which is sad 4 it leaves you wanting more <UNK> 5 the makers of the film are the kind of people who don't care what their monster looks like just give him a 30 mask good enough for me 6 the scarecrow runs a chick over awesome 7 the film makers don't actually make their actors sing or play the guitar 8 the scarecrow uses a <UNK> pole as a <UNK> and <UNK> the dude who doesn't actually play the guitar or sing 9 the scarecrow can choke a dude in like 3 seconds 10 it makes you actually think of all these things and write them down for other people god what am i doing
<START> i saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on hbo and i loved it it was so hilarious i have seen it too many times to count i love the <UNK> brothers and the pitiful ugly dog my favorite quote form the movie is it's so ugly it should be put to sleep i also loved it when the little sister <UNK> the girls on the back and their faces stick that way i love john cusack and <UNK> moore in this movie too they were great this movie brings back memories of my college days when i first saw it i rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over my college roommate and i just couldn't get enough of it who couldn't love this crazy movie i want to buy a copy on dvd does anyone know where i can get it
<START> i taped this as a teenager in the mid 80s based upon the synopsis in the cable guide the <UNK> hunt aspect <UNK> to me having no knowledge or expectations of the film what a pleasant surprise when i viewed it this was such a fun film and i remember watching it repeatedly i thought that the concept was well executed i enjoyed the harmless competition between the different groups and i thought that the <UNK> hunt itself was quite clever sometimes it seems that people have far too great expectations for movies not all movies are going to have a <UNK> message or stellar acting production values or special effects sometimes movies are just meant to entertain and be fun and this one succeeds on both levels it was so nice to read the comments from the actors who played the twins i haven't seen this movie in years but if i did i think i'd have just as warm and enthusiastic a reaction to it as i did as a teenager even as i type this snippets of the <UNK> yet appropriate theme song are running through my head when midnight madness starts to get to you it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do
<START> i really enjoyed <UNK> camera with dom <UNK> and i was surprised to see that after the years suzanne <UNK> have the co star of the show but that was the only positive side of the show the whole studio the intro the <UNK> all that give the new meaning to the word pompous br br well that would be ok if the <UNK> weren't so <UNK> <UNK> i mean come on the best you can do is show few men that have problem with getting <UNK> out of the bottle suzanne <UNK> walking with halloween basket in july ice cream place that sells only vanilla i've seen few episodes and each time it was horrible they were posing like it's the greatest show ever and then fill the time with scenes so dull that i really felt embarrassed to watch even the people in them looked bored and that just can't be good
<START> drew barrymore is such a great actress when it comes to these kind of movies she stars wonderfully and gets away with the quirks and jokes romantic comedies like this suit her and i believe that she's done her best so far check out her other romantic comedies you'll see what i mean
<START> if you are going to see this movie by all means don't go into this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely hilarious because you will be let down yeah sure its funny at times but i would consider it a political thriller <UNK> as a comedy the performances are very good especially by jeff goldblum as the head of the election company even though he has limited screen time he makes a lasting impression of course robin williams is excellent laura <UNK> is very good too what a surprise she is one of the finest actresses in hollywood and one scene in particular shows this this film makes you think what if a comedian ran for president and actually won would the country be better off or would the country <UNK> into a million pieces
<START> the good news is that the circus is in town the bad news is that's right over bugs <UNK> underground home he wakes up as his place shakes like an <UNK> hit it when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants <UNK> by etc br br to be more specific the <UNK> cage is place exactly over hole the lion <UNK> food and by process of <UNK> figures out it's a rabbit bugs curious what all the <UNK> is about winds his way through the tunnel and winds up in the <UNK> mouth br br i'll say for thing for <UNK> he is totally <UNK> at least in this cartoon and at least for 30 seconds when he comes to his senses he runs like crazy and we get a lion versus a rabbit battle the rest of the way once again bugs faces dumb <UNK> one he calls <UNK> but lion is fierce and bugs will need all his wits and somewhat fake <UNK> to <UNK> off this beast br br about half the gags are stupid and the other half funny but always fast moving colorful and good enough to recommend i mean it's not everyday you can see a lion on a <UNK> or doing a <UNK> dance
<START> i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14 br br i was really annoyed with my little cousin as she was very hyper that day so i saw a film on the disney channel and put it on and told her to watch it br br she is 6 and she loved the film some bits she didn't get like the ending but i didn't get that either y was eddie the star of the video shoot i thought it was <UNK> video but she did enjoy it br br i noticed the mistakes such as at the end jordan was not actually playing the guitar but she never br br it is definitely a film for if you are seriously bored or 10 and under br br it <UNK> my cousin down well br br although all she did was sing for the rest of the day then
<START> the producers of this picture are <UNK> it's not by crazy artistic momentum that x and z are <UNK> in the titles considering that the word means <UNK> in hungarian by the way david is the word for god in hungarian hum is that so br br let's consider this movie as 'a history of <UNK> science fictional sibling both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres thriller and drama in the 2005 one and fx ed as <UNK> science fiction in the one we're looking at right now everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details the nod to phil k dick who wrote in the days of <UNK> pat by creating a fast food restaurant the nod to stanley kubrick by using <UNK> <UNK> pattern as <UNK> became hal one letter down in the <UNK> in the 1968 movie in <UNK> 40 becomes 60 one letter up when <UNK> up <UNK> the nod to david <UNK> by using witty kind of formula <UNK> to ' <UNK> <UNK> and by taking another medium for central theme of a picture tv in <UNK> video games and virtual reality in in 1983 you <UNK> a tv set in 1999 you're <UNK> by a game welcome to canada br br the nod to good taste by getting peter cinematography howard <UNK> music and ronald <UNK> editing a team that wins for everyone born in the early 80's with a super a <UNK> or an <UNK> stick in the hands this movie rings a bell enough with the <UNK> the plot jennifer jason leigh stars as a game designer who creates a virtual reality game that <UNK> into the <UNK> minds as we can see on the movie main details page that's the story in the story to me this picture is about a <UNK> young couple <UNK> the <UNK> new virtual <UNK> presentation session to destroy its <UNK> i assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality if there's such thing as reality jennifer jason leigh is always playing a game designer in the game they're in and the end of the movie is the reality with video games freaks <UNK> big hairy dogs plastic <UNK> <UNK> and stuff and <UNK> <UNK> what you see is true they play during an hour or so in this game there's a game in which plays genius <UNK> and jude law a marketing <UNK> associated with game they play because is very concerned about her health the thing you plug your nervous system in in order to play she has to plug herself and in then wins the game and back in the reality they kill <UNK> <UNK> br br playing and is about facing your essence face your <UNK> while its creating a virtual reality you'll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game by playing the game the girl playing the <UNK> turns into a br br what game would have played to feel his abstract da term to be truly engaged in the world br br and what about yes <UNK> god is dead and you know what willem dafoe stands for him god the br br yes we do <UNK> a narrative for ourselves and losing this thread we follow from one day to the next <UNK> people as personalities <UNK> the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who engaged it truly and we could sometimes get some neat stuff a perception of <UNK> in <UNK> in reality
<START> one day someone said lets <UNK> the <UNK> squad we can make it hip cool and all that <UNK> it'll make a <UNK> then they actually made it and as you are watching it you can hear your <UNK> cringe in agony as it twists and <UNK> into a <UNK> from the pure horror of it all any movie ever made has something on this id rather meet wayne <UNK> and sing <UNK> with him in a gay bar in <UNK> and drink a virgin bloody mary than ever watch this again may god have mercy on my soul
<START> i thought this movie was really awesome one of <UNK> best i am also a fan of michael <UNK> so i thought he was so hot in this movie why all the bad reviews i would want to watch this movie over and over again if i could i also loved the ending this movie clearly has shown a smile on my face i was also surprised that james franco and jessica alba were in it i love them both so i also <UNK> this movie at the end when drew is making the huge comment about the truth it really told the truth of what sometimes happens in high school again the movie was amazing <UNK> a 10 10 hope this comment was very useful to any imdb readers
<START> this film spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana however the plot and visuals are so insane that it seems more like the poster child for <UNK> br br plot the heroic struggle of michael as he battles his drug addiction while being subjected to the <UNK> brought on by the likes of <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> there's a good message but it's <UNK> by the fact that the writers have taken a rather stale <UNK> idea and tried <UNK> it into 30 minutes this includes a song sequence where you're told that there's a million rational ways to say no such as i can't smoke pot i have <UNK> br br the writers can't make up their minds what to do with the characters they've brought in <UNK> free at first we see they all have to hide from the human characters but within five minutes we see them all running around in plain sight without anyone <UNK> soon they begin <UNK> with the human cast and the only one who's even slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drug <UNK> it's the little sister who talks to her teddy bear <UNK> by the way further there's the little drug demon floating around because you know <UNK> don't give kids drugs he too is ambiguous while he might be symbolic of michael's addiction and hence is not supposed to be seen by other people he goes and <UNK> little corey to get her into drugs so i guess he's <UNK> moving on br br the whole plot finally <UNK> in some insane sequence in which michael is in what would appear to be the saturday morning carnival of souls aka a theme park from hell where the various cartoon characters beat him up and ignore him and stuff for example miss <UNK> eats him in a <UNK> and <UNK> him out if the writers were not high when writing this i must recommend they try getting high because they can't get <UNK> than this of course the film ignores the fact that michael's been having <UNK> for two years by this point so why this <UNK> sequence would <UNK> him is beyond me br br i realize i'm completely <UNK> on this film but i actually just saw it again because i went through the trouble of tracking it down on ebay because of it's sheer <UNK> of being a bad cartoon the level of unintentional humor is is brilliant take this scene for example michael's dad is rooting through the <UNK> for a beer he notices many of them missing and mentions it to his wife the ever <UNK> mom tells him don't worry you probably just <UNK> them last night watching football while we're obviously supposed to be learning that michael is drinking beer in addition to the pot and crack we instead read further in and realize hey kids it's okay to have chemical as long as you're a grown up scenes like this are worth the tiny price tag of this film oh <UNK> and the fact you get to hear simon the <UNK> say marijuana
<START> shadows <UNK> the smell of new <UNK> streets like no film before it this kick off of <UNK> directorial work is as atmospheric as political and the initial spark for a <UNK> in american cinema br br maybe it <UNK> for watching <UNK> first work in a double feature with another debut <UNK> <UNK> bout de <UNK> both films shaped the cinematic production of their countries beyond decades and both breathe a peculiar <UNK> and which was later rarely achieved by those filmmakers in their career br br shadows tells from three <UNK> american siblings ben ben <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and hugh hugh <UNK> the story is set in the new york jazz <UNK> and the driving <UNK> on the soundtrack play a main part for the <UNK> sometimes almost <UNK> atmosphere which draws through the entire film there's not much happening in the plot the everyday life of the three siblings is defined by problems in love relationship or in their jobs but on both levels <UNK> <UNK> without <UNK> cassavetes simply describes the <UNK> of racial <UNK> in public and in private life it was regarding to the cinematic depiction of racism a breakthrough film in the us br br this film owes also a lot to the performances of the three leading actors which were all almost completely unknown before especially ben <UNK> established with his energetic portrayal the image of a new self conception of young urban blacks in america an image which <UNK> spike lee's films of the 80s and 90s <UNK> none of those three <UNK> extremely talented actors was able to start a big career afterwards hollywood wasn't and isn't ready to <UNK> expand its star system and that is why <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> only found small artistic in tv and independent films later on br br perhaps shadows is one of the less beautiful films ever shot and one of the most beautiful ones at the same time a film of shades and spaces with a camera that merely watches the stream of life in the crowded street <UNK> bars hotel <UNK> apartments inducing an intriguing <UNK> through new <UNK> vibrant streets
<START> our story two u s navy deep sea <UNK> search for silver <UNK> hidden beneath the ocean off the <UNK> coast our proof extremely dull entertainment at its best with no plot in sight jim brown is completely wasted provided his help in producing this 70s war turkey richard <UNK> is in his usual form don <UNK> and richard <UNK> are among those who gave special thanks in their <UNK> bombs away
<START> few movies have <UNK> expectations and upset me as much as fire has the movie is pretentious garbage it does not achieve anything at an artistic level the only thing it managed to receive is a <UNK> in india if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the <UNK> controversy the <UNK> would have been more <UNK> br br now that i've got my distress out of my system i am more able to <UNK> the movie br br from the <UNK> the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start <UNK> in english the director of course did not make the movie for an indian audience however it <UNK> its international audiences by over <UNK> it watching the character of the domestic help <UNK> in perfect english is too unreal to be true br br next we get regular glimpses into <UNK> dreams these scenes are not very effective they coming up as jarring and <UNK> the flow of the movie i'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story i felt that the <UNK> was lost br br the love scenes felt <UNK> and are probably meant for audience <UNK> rather than being a powerful statement in any case they do not achieve either of the two br br the names chosen for the women <UNK> and <UNK> are names of <UNK> <UNK> and hence been selected to shock the audiences however since the film wasn't meant for indian audiences in the first place the shock through name selection is not meant to achieve its goal which is absurd br br the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject br br the acting felt wooden although <UNK> <UNK> brought some life into the role the others were wasted i always thought that <UNK> <UNK> was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film the male leads were outright rubbish br br in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one please
<START> this movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies i have ever seen danny de <UNK> plays owen perfectly <UNK> is excellently portrayed and was one of the highlights of the movie br br at the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles larry teaches a writing class and owen <UNK> after larry trying to get him to read his story owen eventually asks larry to kill his mother and in return owen would kill <UNK> ex wife the whole movie was really hilarious br br one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when owen writes throw <UNK> from the train larry gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot it turns out that owen wrote a children's pop up book br br i would really recommend this movie i gave it a 10
<START> i saw this movie while surfing through <UNK> and late night 80's sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning i must say i didn't expect much and i didn't get much although rose is hot her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscar worthy to say the least this movie has its ups and downs and does have a nice couple of twists at the end but in all honesty it was awful not even a typical slasher movie no gore no sex no nudity no real violence just bad acting i'd give it a 3 out of 10
<START> this was an excellent movie fast paced well written and had an intriguing plot the special effects were innovative especially in the opening scene the training segment got a bit silly but overall it was a tense movie
<START> excellent documentary that still manages to shock and <UNK> unfortunately times haven't changed much since this was made and it is thus an important piece for all freedom conscious americans to see
<START> okay it was very good but best picture please not even close <UNK> was better capote was much better good night and good luck was much better <UNK> mountain well that should have won the academy voters seem to act like the current day <UNK> please just a little of everyone but don't dare take any <UNK> positions that's why we have a complete moron in office in the us br br this has been the worst <UNK> presentation and forget 1987 since way before that hollywood is so afraid of it's bottom line that it can't be set straight many voters apparently didn't even see <UNK> mountain get real and get with it br br this was the most pathetic year since i have been watching in the mid 60's and i was only two br br wake up whoever you are hollywood is mainstream and that's what happened to the box office in 2005 king kong the last star wars film another batman film a re make or whatever of charlie and the chocolate factory and much more to come in 2006 br br at least there were original best pictures i e <UNK> but heard that one before capote great <UNK> <UNK> should have won even though now we know reese can sing like a cash carter etc <UNK> was a much better picture than crash that film has been done since the early 1960's and we have to make that the best film what a horrible oscar night and a horrible year to end with in 2005 and another boring year in 2006 at least the <UNK> for best picture went to <UNK> and what about the horrible song that won pathetic i think we only have about 20 years left as america or the usa before someone comes in and changes up things a bit maybe it will be china since they own so much of this country or india because they have all the high tech jobs and are the largest <UNK> country in the entire world br br america has become the land of the fat the pathetic and the stupid trash can be found in more places than florida west <UNK> south <UNK> and in the mid west br br drive through a local <UNK> or <UNK> king for goodness sake order all you want until you get a heart attack put yourself out of your misery
<START> sometimes but very rarely a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult this movie tells several stories so well simultaneously that it was the first few times a movie i could not watch to <UNK> it was too real and the characters so strong that watching it became a personal struggle seeing these three men and their families deal with their <UNK> one in particular often hit me too hard now i have watched in its entirety without <UNK> several times and i realize what i always suspected this movie is a masterpiece the writing the acting the <UNK> of several stories without being even the least bit choppy everything about this movie is exceptional seven academy awards no wonder it certainly must have deserved them
<START> this film easily rivals the emotional strength the dramatic impact and the top notch performances of 12 angry men i rented it on a <UNK> and was amazed that i had not heard of it before br br i do not know if this was <UNK> directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as the some clever camera work surrounding the character <UNK> plays all suggest a natural eye br br the interplay between martin and <UNK> contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and <UNK> a variation on her characters in at play in the fields of the lord she is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time br br there are some moments where i feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between <UNK> and his ex girlfriend almost seem written for another film <UNK> comes off as another character all together but those are minor complaints br br this film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences i rate it 8 out of a difficult 10 br br
<START> i saw this movie on tv and loved it i am a real disaster film fan and this one was great the cast was made of some really interesting people connie is always great and william <UNK> is in a league of his own he can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can the story line is great too the thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen and to use this time line to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea and this movie brings it out in such a way that is almost totally believable
<START> this is one of the worst films i have seen in a while br br the problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film <UNK> or an exercise is <UNK> as a result it fails on all accounts br br the acting is atrocious the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointless br br <UNK> kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isn't a good thing sure he has an intense and <UNK> look but ultimately he can't actually act just look at how he <UNK> when his mistress leaves br br really don't watch this film some say it needs repeat viewings i say one is too many
<START> the daytime tv of films seldom have i felt so little <UNK> to characters seldom have i been made to cringe by such dire dialogue <UNK> london thirty somethings <UNK> round lurid bbc sets <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> avoid this film as if it were your <UNK>
<START> another <UNK> comedy set in the park it seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park as so many of <UNK> and <UNK> films are set there and while this is yet another one it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed it br br <UNK> is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting mabel <UNK> i think she's supposed to be a little younger though in her mother's eyes she is too young to be interested in men well <UNK> does not share her feelings and soon he and mabel run away for some innocent fun things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen <UNK> finds it and gives it to mabel as a gift and many problems result br br decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film
<START> i believe i share the same psychological <UNK> on the world with <UNK> he is polish i am dutch yet we share a <UNK> mind the world is not void of the <UNK> amidst total coincidence hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet prime minister so that as a social and cultural <UNK> pressure <UNK> could play the role it did in wwii being critical yet christian towards the jews but often not less critical toward <UNK> there are innocence and guilt in <UNK> world view as the symbols in <UNK> the white versus the black madonna in <UNK> the black madonna is she who the judge fell in love with when he was a young man flashbacks are magically realistically <UNK> with the present although totally <UNK> such as the camera simply swinging to the other side of the street or the then young <UNK> red <UNK> passing by the now young woman's car after she accidentally hit his dog with it that we <UNK> through time in those same camera moves is what we grasp later his love was unanswered so that his life wasn't as he had planned it he lost his ability to love other people and animals being a judge he feels he is actually <UNK> on other <UNK> lives and when he <UNK> he simply continues to do so <UNK> on his neighbors this time the innocence and sense of <UNK> of the younger woman literally accidentally getting into his life his better judgment and it is because of her that he <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> behavior to his neighbors and the police accepting and even holding on to the stones thrown through his windows in the process history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves although this time he is old and the woman not the same <UNK> may have <UNK> with this bit for the old judge is his alter ego and it is said he was <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> both women play the same essential role in his psychology of the one who possesses his heart and soul and therefore can make him or break him even as an old man it is as if the <UNK> in the are or god is bringing them together <UNK> are too <UNK> to just be chance or even good luck there has to be some mystical supernatural or <UNK> source <UNK> these <UNK> deep life decisions the study book fell and opened at the page of the <UNK> question is another example of this or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman the wind outside the opera house suddenly <UNK> the open doors and breaks the windows the gigantic picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on tv after the drowning accident on her <UNK> crossing trip these moments are effectively <UNK> through the human voice of or what sounds like it van <UNK>
<START> a great performance by clint eastwood and particularly john <UNK> in my opinion his finest one to date <UNK> had this one nailed right down to the floor it's incredible eastwood is agent mike an aged and cynical secret service agent who is finishing out his career <UNK> and chasing down routine <UNK> but one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious and his new partner al are sent to investigate a threat on the president by a <UNK> as fate would have it has stumbled not upon a <UNK> nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the white house as <UNK> deeper into <UNK> world he <UNK> the bad guy's <UNK> attention and <UNK> admiration for him was <UNK> top agent and present in dallas texas when he was <UNK> and blames himself for what happened now he feels it's up to him to stop the current head of state from joining the list of dead <UNK> but this killer has turned the tables on and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game who will win who will die it's a race against time to save the <UNK> from a <UNK> like enemy who can get to anyone my favorite secret service movie and as good a nail <UNK> as any
<START> yes i watch this show because my girlfriend watches it of course well at least that's what i tell my friends but as nobody here ever known me i can say this i love it that's excellent trash tv br br first there's the <UNK> <UNK> herself who doesn't miss a single opportunity to talk about herself yet she is to be taken seriously as she is quite the <UNK> then there's jay <UNK> a sober gay guy very serious and amazingly professional and miss jay an <UNK> one queen of the <UNK> and a damn funny guy and <UNK> self <UNK> as the only man on the <UNK> br br second the show is an in depth look at a shallow industry and we've got to give it to the producers for showing us the inside view which can be informative as well as entertaining br br finally the edition is great there is just the right mix of everything the girls living together in the ego house their impressions on sets the <UNK> themselves and the judging all of this <UNK> smoothly with just the right beat there are no <UNK> br br of course there must be other factors that led to <UNK> that we don't see in the shows the <UNK> is made up of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and quick on the <UNK> <UNK> to those who <UNK> them but that being said as long as one contestant does not step on their <UNK> their judgment is usually fair i think br br so give your brain a break if you can't beat them join them and have a good time watching this bit of reality tv with your loved ones it will make <UNK> for more somehow
<START> this movie is almost unknown but it is very good in a lonely danish town two old sisters live remembering a far <UNK> when due to a strict <UNK> education they had to reject happiness lonely then the live in a <UNK> <UNK> until <UNK> who flies from paris frightened by the horror of the war arrives in few time she will be able to turn the goodness and love she received when she arrived a good <UNK> prize lets her <UNK> a great <UNK> following the best rules of french all <UNK> are invited all <UNK> <UNK> they accept but they <UNK> to not show any trace of pleasure or enjoyment as it would be a sin however the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat that they become <UNK> by the <UNK> of french the <UNK> end in a very felt though quietly happiness the love between humans has <UNK> the miracle of rise the human kindness due to the pleasure of the sense has begun the movie is surprisingly good but it is not for all tastes during most of the movie nothing happens all is so quiet and so peaceful that during many minutes you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the town but as the movie develops it becomes more precious when <UNK> wins the <UNK> prize after <UNK> movie the show begins the author is able with a perfect directing to show us how <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful one love all told in a quiet delicious way with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting then as the <UNK> goes by the quality in showing us how the mood of all <UNK> changes due to the meal only with first shots with <UNK> filmed scenes one after another is simply astonishing in addition the <UNK> with the colours and the photography is also superb almost every scene of the movie is like a picture so work is involved there if you are able to admire good cinema and are able to realize that sometimes the way on telling you something rather than what is told is more important this is your movie if you happen to like good <UNK> and just love the good probably you'll feel amused as most feelings of the movie will be familiar to you an oscar totally deserved the only problem is its <UNK> at setting up the story but i can forgive it i hope everyone too
<START> i must first mention that as a group of mates we often find entertainment in <UNK> films which are known to be terrible for comedy value hence our rental of camp blood br br camp blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder and was so rubbish it <UNK> even funny br br the dvd was returned and a <UNK> was <UNK> with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is <UNK> to prevent such utter rubbish being <UNK> br br don't do what i did and let the curiosity get the better of you it's so bad it's not even funny
<START> this is by far one of the best films that india has ever made following are the plus points of the film br br wonderful direction cinematography and editing the editing is very smooth and the timing of is excellent br br even though the film shows the life of <UNK> policemen and their <UNK> it never gets boring or sympathetic br br mind blowing acting by lead actor <UNK> <UNK> one can surely hope that he gets nominated for the best actor for the academy awards br br controlled violence the violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess br br no stupid songs as in usual indian movies br br
<START> this movie could have had a lot of potential certainly with today's technology one would expect real special effects but movies are not made with special effects alone of course acting is needed this film lacked both br br first let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible why can't a movie take artistic license if you want to know about the story of <UNK> read the bible i have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact look at of movie from its artistic br br in viewing this movie you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version it fails miserably in that heston and had presence they became their roles you don't see this here br br even if you don't compare standing on it's own this movie to too rushed parts where a scene should be developed it does not it becomes boring br br my advice skip this and watch the other as campy as the other is it's far and away the better movie
<START> absolutely i agree with my previous <UNK> in describing this as a riveting fascinating and certainly beautiful film it's not necessary to see all the episodes since the first ones are the best while the last ones are a bit tiresome but for any person who likes and their good natured ways all episodes are worth seeing in typical german fashion values are constantly <UNK> even it's murderous nazi past is confronted in the last episodes the rich dialogues are particularly interesting these episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in germany preferably in original language br br
<START> this really is a movie that you need to see twice when i first saw this film i was really drawn into the story while the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room the stories that buddy nick drake wonderful <UNK> and daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels the soundtrack <UNK> the movie perfectly dark lo fi and intriguing when you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending i have seen in a long time i hope to see this movie find a <UNK> for the dvd so that it will be more accessible great movie you won't be disappointed
<START> barney and friends is probably the worst kids show that i have ever seen it teaches kids nothing the songs are corny it is not educational and the characters are just plain i am not one to disagree with those who hate the show honestly i have seen more negative than positive reviews for this show 75 of the reviews are negative and there are some really mature people this show contains no educational value or age appropriate educational material whatsoever more reasons why i dislike this show is because of the crappy plots cheesy dialogue horrid special effects and the abysmal story lines besides it says that you should eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends saying that is a model of what <UNK> television should be as expressed by <UNK> <UNK> dorothy and <UNK> singer is a load of crap they don't know what they're talking about i would never recommend barney to anyone <UNK> reason why some kids keep crying for or get addicted to junk is because of this show <UNK> the minds of children everywhere for people parents children who seek real <UNK> <UNK> switch over to nick jr and watch super why instead it's far more better than this turd and five tv once had the nerve to put it on but thankfully took it off i highly advise everyone to keep far away from this show as possible parents i highly advise you to keep your kids as far away from this show as possible they'll thank you later br br bottom line don't bother wasting your valuable time with this stupid show it's utter garbage <UNK> 10 grade z avoid like the plague br br thanks for reading
<START> this four hour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary primarily because the filmmakers seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen they seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out the film opens with sir walter reading from the book that is his primary <UNK> in his troubles this introduces the family all of whom we get to know <UNK> over the next four hours anyway but serves little other purpose similarly the scenes where the <UNK> poor richard serve no purpose but to drag the story down some of <UNK> actual dialogue is <UNK> to different characters and some of her narrative is recycled as dialogue that falls <UNK> from the <UNK> of the characters there is some fill in dialogue too and this is uniformly dreadful the scene where charles <UNK> is boring <UNK> with his concerns about getting dr <UNK> was only barely interesting as narrative in the book as a scene in this production it is <UNK> the scene on the <UNK> when <UNK> falls and is taken up lifeless is entirely without urgency and i wondered whether <UNK> line is there nobody to help me might have been directed at the writers as well as the other actors br br this production often looks and feels like a play that has been filmed rather than an actual film and this is most evident in the acting which is the opposite of subtle <UNK> delivery of lines exaggerated gestures and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands feet or faces when they are not speaking their lines charles <UNK> stands in his <UNK> feet shoulder <UNK> apart and appears to project to the balcony if there were one when speaking to the other people in the room with him <UNK> face when not <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> seems to be in confused <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> creature and i did not for a moment believe that <UNK> would be interested in her br br the costumes are a mixed bunch but mostly awful and anne <UNK> green <UNK> <UNK> is quite possibly the most hideous alleged period costume ever <UNK> we are given the dates at the beginning of the show it is the late or perhaps very early <UNK> and yet many of the costumes seem to be of victorian design and thus about 60 years too early the hair is just so wrong that i won't even mention it here except to say that i won't mention it br br this production does do some things right however mrs smith is given her proper importance and her history with mr elliot his and his <UNK> are fully addressed i was also pleased to see the fleshed out <UNK> scenes with anne and <UNK> at the end which are precious reward for the reader but were <UNK> over in the 1995 production br br if you love the book <UNK> and even vaguely like the 1995 movie don't waste a moment or a penny on this production you will find it sorely wanting
<START> i remember seeing this movie as a child in the 60's it took my breath away then at young age i was glued to my seat in front of the black and white tv the cast was one of the best i have seen in my life the musical was one the greatest ever have been written please to the gershwin and <UNK> families please release this on video or dvd so that the generations now and in the future can experience what i'm sure what so many of us have done when we saw this great work of art please consider let not this great man's work go unseen for years more i m praying and hoping that the hearts of these families will be <UNK> and let the world see this great movie again
<START> i'll have to admit that i'm at a <UNK> here when i learn more about a film from other reviewers than from watching it myself then that's a problem although the plot of the man who knew too much seems generally straightforward the movie allows too many <UNK> elements to get in the way of what could have been a satisfying mystery by the time we get to the scene where a <UNK> looking woman <UNK> the <UNK> of the first degree of the seven <UNK> ray i didn't know whether to laugh or <UNK> to see if i missed something br br in retrospect the <UNK> note <UNK> by mr lawrence leslie banks from the handle of a <UNK> brush was a <UNK> written message leading to a dentist named and eventually to the albert hall a place not a person as <UNK> by a hall but for all the intrigue it's never made clear why the assassination target was being eliminated okay so louis bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to <UNK> a <UNK> named but why was a target come to think of it why was the note even written and <UNK> in the <UNK> brush did bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen br br with it's disjointed scenes the man who knew too much is hard to follow and a bit <UNK> however i'll give alfred hitchcock credit for this early effort for perspective i'll have to watch some of his other work of the same era though this movie certainly can't hold a candle to his later works like psycho or north by <UNK>
<START> i saw this film at a small screening even though it had a low budget the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie it's april 8 1994 each of the characters are in their mid <UNK> and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition acting music film writing when they learn of <UNK> singer kurt suicide they quickly get inspiration to travel from san francisco to seattle and attend the <UNK> <UNK> it's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes highlights include a visit to <UNK> grave kurt original childhood home and a <UNK> sing along an honest an original piece of work
<START> tim burton is in essence an <UNK> film maker <UNK> in <UNK> of character and obsessed with gothic scope <UNK> for style over substance <UNK> throughout his career however with his style being so <UNK> endearing i like many <UNK> forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become <UNK> in what are essentially one hundred million dollar art films br br it's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise especially when that <UNK> target audience are half witted 15 year old boys batman returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor <UNK> box office draw and cheap in actual fact very expensive thrills being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience had this been the result then tim burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment instead burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase <UNK> <UNK> br br from the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison like containing their newly born <UNK> baby into a river it is clear that batman returns ain't no <UNK> at <UNK> palace cut to thirty three years later during a political speech made by bad guy business <UNK> max portrayed by christopher walken the red triangle circus gang attack <UNK> city batman michael keaton returning to the role makes his first appearance sporting a new <UNK> eventually saving the day is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black <UNK> into <UNK> the political return of the baby now a fully grown penguin man danny <UNK> in <UNK> perfect make up whose motives for return are suspicious only to batman br br meanwhile attempts to off his <UNK> and awkward assistant <UNK> kyle played perfectly by michelle pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic <UNK> out for revenge and <UNK> for some unexplained reason a deadly <UNK> against the dark knight br br batman returns is bleak the production design is breathtaking delivering a cold haunting <UNK> city with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor danny <UNK> score supports the film brilliantly ranging from <UNK> to tragic the tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding shot like a sad nightmare <UNK> direction <UNK> what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for <UNK> visual style of film making and whilst <UNK> action sequences struggle for <UNK> the real excitement lies in the <UNK> choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters the <UNK> demise the <UNK> mental state and bruce wayne's lonely destiny br br warner brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed after all they wanted a batman sequel not a weird somewhat ghastly horror movie in which a <UNK> <UNK> orphan attempts to kidnap and <UNK> a <UNK> of babies all the while <UNK> what can only be described as green the production company wanted an audience friendly feature something for the <UNK> clan to promote their happy <UNK> with not a movie of dire <UNK> characters including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a <UNK> and <UNK> by a gang of cats awakening her from <UNK> by chewing on her <UNK> ice cold fingers br br it's easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of batman returns the film never felt like a batman blockbuster it is questionable if burton really knew who batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and <UNK> lonely characters who rarely <UNK> with societies standards and expectations this is why burton failed to create a great batman film he did however create a nostalgic and stunning <UNK> piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine br br this may not be a great batman movie but it is a great tim burton film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> first live action <UNK> in the way of a major motion picture that benefits from incredible model fx work and a great barry gray music score the reel to reel <UNK> computers in the far off year i guess anderson really wanted a safe date of a 100 years later are a hoot to see as are the guru jacket fashions but one could easily <UNK> 2001 of the same <UNK> but no one could have <UNK> some things as they turn out this film was the <UNK> for the series <UNK> the following year and in fact not only had the same fx people and producers but many of the cast were <UNK> in that show br br it always comes off like an alternate history future more than anything else the apollo like rocket used in the lift off it always seems like this is really another planet than earth given the alternate earth plot one would assume that was the feeling they wanted we end up with an ending that <UNK> more questions than answers that because the other earth exists every movement event and thing said is <UNK> as it's happening on both worlds because of that given and the sun in between the two versions of the same person in this case glenn ross astronaut can never meet a complete accident discovered the planet in the first place when it would have most likely stayed a secret forever br br filmed mostly in <UNK> with fx work in england it's a must own for any <UNK> anderson fan i have the image bare bones dvd from a few years ago now out of print but one hopes universal will re release it with perhaps extras and even a <UNK> anderson commentary
<START> don wilson stars as a cop who enjoys the occasional virtual reality fighting game however things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game okay actually they make the models as prototype but the main bad guy from the video game <UNK> and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat the guy is don wilson who in the mean time falls in love with the model actually with all things considered my biggest confusion was trying to understand if the people brought over from virtual reality land were robots human <UNK> or just some type of <UNK> computer program it doesn't matter since this is all just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors ever butcher dialog as if he were running a <UNK> don <UNK> complete lack of charisma is the film's biggest flaw since one just doesn't like the guy he's too <UNK> <UNK> his voice is too high pitched and doesn't look very impressive in the action sequences what saves this bore fest from my lowest rating is massey who looks super hot in high cut outfits and who gets occasionally naked also on board is loren a good martial artist stella stevens and michael <UNK> as the main voice of the bad guy but their efforts are in vain as they are all <UNK> by the very bad acting of wilson another flaw which is the film's biggest mistake is a lack of action as we are asked to watch the story unfold but aside from <UNK> nudity and maybe some unintentional <UNK> due to laughably unconvincing acting there really is nothing of interest this also <UNK> to the action sequences in which are <UNK> choreographed badly directed and completely <UNK> of all possible excitement making this virtually unwatchable br br out of 4 bad
<START> how can anybody give this anything higher than a <UNK> br br i thought <UNK> the hands of fate would forever be the worst movie ever to itself upon my <UNK> nerve indeed i didn't think anything could be worse br br i was wrong <UNK> is that rare movie where every single element of it is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bad how often have you watched a movie and commented who the hell lit this thing from lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to well everything this movie is absolutely <UNK> it's so bad i couldn't even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama i'd ever seen br br it's too bad even to be laughable i'd sooner eat a of broken glass than sit through it again
<START> like an earlier i saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story splendid acting and dramatic musical score it certainly contains some of sam finest work he and the writers depict <UNK> not simply as an <UNK> <UNK> hero which he was but also as naive fond of alcohol and <UNK> a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype
<START> <UNK> <UNK> tv purchased the rights to this film and the network is showing it using the english title the <UNK> br br <UNK> the <UNK> takes amateur home movie style movie making to amazing levels of <UNK> the movie depicts a long <UNK> series of boring <UNK> of an uninteresting confused guy this lead character <UNK> wu does not simply walk about <UNK> viewers will unfortunately soon realize that <UNK> wu has an <UNK> talent to seek out and remain <UNK> near the most obnoxious noises to be found in china <UNK> empty tin <UNK> being beaten with a stick he is there every old <UNK> in china <UNK> in agony he is there a crying baby yes you guessed it he is there according to the <UNK> china is the most irritating unpleasant sounding place on planet earth br br the only element worse than the sound of the <UNK> is the photography the camera shakes shakes and shakes some more finally the camera stills but then it falls to the actor's knees and just stays there until someone in the crew realizes the mistake and begins to shake the camera again most of the shaky film is framed in distant long long long shots the few times when the camera gets somewhat close nothing compelling ever takes place to connect the viewer with what is happening br br the photography is murky faded and often <UNK> the use of color is well there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color most every shot is held 20 times too long few movies are so painful to sit through this film is painful to watch and painful to hear and then it simply ends br br john woo fans might enjoy being able to hear part of the soundtrack to die <UNK> the killer as the lead character is hanging outside of a video store for many minutes anyway be warned the <UNK> will steal away your good time
<START> this is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party i go to it is clear from the start that steve was taking this role seriously the other principles were walking through their lines i think they got a <UNK> of how much it <UNK> early on and they were going through the motions for their <UNK> sean bean acted as usual but was <UNK> sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was some actors do not look good <UNK> some actors should not bulk up for a part those two statements apply to police academy steve his <UNK> look <UNK> to bum and <UNK> and his up makes him look <UNK> <UNK> not buff pair that with one of the worst scripted dialogues in hollywood history and you have bad movie i can only guess that all of the principles really really needed the money for or something or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys that must of <UNK> it out i would love to know the back story to this disaster
<START> i saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it the music and scenery are beautiful i purchased the vhs tape a few years ago and watch it frequently i would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older <UNK> john music
<START> this is first of all a good exciting story with well developed characters but all the other details are well crafted on top of that leading to a wonderful film don't let the disney label lead you to think this is <UNK> down or only for kids it has a lot to offer to all ages whether you like golf or not one of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting and speaking as one of many who can't <UNK> golf on tv this is no small feat br br the first half of the film does a good job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds enough that you end up liking all the important <UNK> once the pivotal match begins halfway through sure you root for character all along but his primary opponents are likable and interesting in their own right the background <UNK> is important once the golf match becomes a match using minds as well as golf <UNK> since you get a good understanding for what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the play progresses br br the computer effects are flashy but they do help the story more often than not the directing has all sorts of clever golf shots and the period costumes and sets are really top notch br br there are a few small <UNK> many of the minor characters seem a little too <UNK> cast from the class <UNK> mold but this is forgivable with the major characters so well drawn br br <UNK> playing francis is as usual <UNK> and sympathetic but the real standout is steven playing harry he rarely moves his face but his intense often sad eyes and minor changes of expression say so much br br <UNK> eddie <UNK> played by josh <UNK> steals the scenes he is in after you see the film <UNK> to find the actual photograph of and <UNK> at the <UNK> to get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match truly was
<START> stone has tried another type of movie any given sunday falls short of a the above average the last boy <UNK> and the below average against all odds stone can be fantastic see the doors natural born killers or platoon but he can also repeat himself see <UNK> or born on the fourth of july his real brilliance is realized in the michael caine perfection the hand
<START> the film moves along quite well but the acting direction and editing leave a lot to be desired the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the <UNK> jones <UNK> is straight out of gone in 50 seconds the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that leaves everyone dead you should never really know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person <UNK> and <UNK> at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been one just become increasingly critical a pity <UNK> it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying that'll be ok for a scene he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more <UNK> and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference
<START> i tried to give this show a chance but it really doesn't sit well with me although the performances are good the writing isn't the two oldest step siblings derek and <UNK> are equally annoying i get the impression that we're supposed to side with <UNK> given that she's the protagonist but i don't find her at all likable the parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless the three younger children are the most watchable things on the show <UNK> and <UNK> are sweet the way they team up and <UNK> is adorable the plot lines are a bit far fetched and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow <UNK> families are common yes but this family isn't really trying all that hard to blend on the whole i think it <UNK> thumbs down
<START> halloween <UNK> 1995 the <UNK> cut review br br halloween <UNK> starts of with a <UNK> of the horrific ending to part five if you thought the last chapter was dark this one will really blow your mind a mysterious man in black has <UNK> the <UNK> police department <UNK> micheal myers in the process poor jamie lloyd was <UNK> by strange <UNK> what they want with her who knows but let's just say her long suffering will end soon doctor <UNK> is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop michael myers from killing any more <UNK> good luck a friend of <UNK> doctor <UNK> comes back after a four sequel <UNK> to help the good doctor another old face from part one guest stars as well br br this dark and dreary sequel was <UNK> during the post production editing for some reason the <UNK> felt that the final product wasn't worth the average horror film <UNK> time so they decide to dumb it down then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office no matter what they did to the film they made it worse they should have left well enough alone hey the film company knows better than the filmmakers now don't they br br <UNK> cut highly recommended br br released version not recommended
<START> a very surprisingly underrated movie very realistic and authentic with great dialogue being italian i can definitely relate to the situations and phrases used i thought joe <UNK> was great as a crazy mob cowboy type and <UNK> and vincent were great also i liked the actor who played the boss he was very authentic i think the director ralph <UNK> was on his way to great things but was cut down too early maybe because he knew too much i thought it was great it deserved more <UNK> and recognition it was a sleeper movie great very good it really had good authenticity it was well done
<START> i could watch this movie all day i love it probably my all time favorite movies but by the way there are a few parts with bad language not too bad but it's not exactly g rated great movie i recommend it to everybody any way it's making me type 10 lines of text so i am going to keep <UNK> until it will let me post this comment okay still <UNK> this is getting annoying ugh i still have four more to go anyway watch this movie even if you have already seen it i don't care has it been 10 lines yet nope only 2 more lines left i don't even know why it wants me to do this i think i am done wait a minute i'm not done sorry people i know it's torture listening to me well i suppose that you don't have to read this comment but you should because i wrote it i am probably done now finally bye
<START> not too good a movie sure it contains action but the effects aren't all that good for a <UNK> movie <UNK> effects are downright horrible acting is <UNK> br br it is nothing like far cry other than names and the very <UNK> of the story <UNK> enhanced super soldiers going amok the super soldiers are very different the <UNK> are different the setting are completely different <UNK> island in the pacific in the game island in northern ish america in the movie br br i loved playing far cry i loved the story and setting i hated the movie
<START> br br the author tried to make a kevin style movie but he definitely failed the result is a boring film that cannot sustain itself using only the dialogues fortunately i had my remote control and could see the tape using the speed
<START> the apartment complex is a campy comedy full of characters created in <UNK> of a real story which tells a young <UNK> student lowe who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes <UNK> in a murder mystery um if you can call it that this low cal watch contains no suspense no thrills no drama no action precious few funny moments a dash of nudity and almost no romance the apartment complex is passable forgettable junk food for only the most <UNK> couch <UNK>
<START> wow the storyline to this was just incredibly stupid i realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre but still even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense br br water has become incredibly rare substance br br well that's strange considering that <UNK> or <UNK> is one of the most <UNK> <UNK> there is in the universe and pretty easy to make together <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> water br br instead of water the <UNK> of <UNK> or some such <UNK> should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after water as a plot device was just dumb dumb dumb br br the comedy seemed <UNK> and contrived and forced the comedy in the tv series red dwarf was <UNK> and contrived and forced but it was actually amusing here instead i felt like saying ha ha that was just so funny i forgot to laugh br br sigh all that money put into sets costumes actors what a waste br br rather than just <UNK> and <UNK> and complain at it's <UNK> my <UNK> to make it better 1 use a believable plot device 2 get rid of the comedy none of the actors were really any good at it the movie would work better as a serious action adventure br br the obvious intention of the writers was to do a <UNK> comedy but they didn't quite pull it off it's not likely i'll ever watch this again it's too much a total hack job
<START> i saw this film at the 3rd <UNK> international film festival at the palace cinemas and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in australian films that seem to <UNK> around a race b gender and c class in favour of er dare i say jolly good cinema the producer a shy slightly eccentric <UNK> called alex introduced his film made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood apparently he's spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film mostly in europe the world the film creates is both brilliant and arty not least because of strange and <UNK> editing style the gothic characters and the surreal sense of time and place that draws viewers into its nightmarish realm br br the producer returned for the q a after <UNK> someone asked him what his inspiration was he <UNK> south australia hear hear another asked him what a in the life of <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> that he drives an old <UNK> that he has breakfast at the same table at the same restaurant that he's jolly well eaten at for the past 8 years and that he plays piano which helps him to think he doesn't drink booze and plays <UNK> once a week then the q and a session ended abruptly because of the next film screening so my thoughts are that for the next festival they need to <UNK> the after film sessions
<START> cult starts 20 years ago on the mountain range southern <UNK> as a guy called owen robert finds an ancient <UNK> said to have magical powers cut to california where has set up a cult the members are about to sacrifice themselves when one of them <UNK> his evil scheme jump forward to the present day as five college students <UNK> rachel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> glenn <UNK> alex joel morgan victoria are <UNK> the events of twenty years ago that have become know as the <UNK> for a school project unfortunately morgan decides to kill herself which <UNK> the evil spirit of owen for reasons that are rather <UNK> he sets about <UNK> what he started all those years ago by claiming souls so he can finally <UNK> the magical powers of the <UNK> for his own evil use br br edited co produced directed by joe <UNK> this is not a good film that's being kind to it the script by benjamin <UNK> which seems to take itself very seriously is a <UNK> supernatural tale about a cult leader who comes back from the dead to finish what he started a few years prior as you would expect the character's involved now have <UNK> to what happened all those years ago it's as dull as it sounds the character's are bland forgettable the dialogue just as much so there's no proper horror or exploitation in it it's slow going at times it's predictable it's clichéd it goes completely off the <UNK> at the end doesn't make much sense when you think about it the story never grips or <UNK> you it's never exciting or particularly interesting i'd struggle to even call it average there is very little here by which i could recommend cult don't bother with this one br br director <UNK> does alright but the film has that bland shot on video made for tv look about it it's utterly forgettable flat stuff throughout there's no scares there's no atmosphere it lacks any tension there is no gore either sure there's a fair amount of blood splatter but no proper actual special make up effect gore scenes br br with a supposed budget of about <UNK> 000 cult looks cheap although it's not as badly made as some low budget horror films i've seen recently the acting isn't even worth mentioning br br cult is a poor film that didn't do anything for me i'd struggle to call this average there are much better horror films out there
<START> this is not what one would term a happy tale the titled leading character edmund <UNK> as the egyptian does not get the gal although he does evidently get the <UNK> word the otherwise principal tragic figure michael <UNK> as the politically <UNK> <UNK> ends up <UNK> and the wrong guy  even if it is victor mature winds up winning all the <UNK> peter ustinov possibly had gotten the best part <UNK> and arguably may have stolen some if not most of the movie except for top billed jean simmons as the somewhat <UNK> <UNK> merit whom just possibly has more on the ball  intellectually and <UNK> than all of the rest of them put together br br the brooding and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is portrayed as a dark cynical tortured soul whom spends the entire plot  his lifetime seeking the meaning of <UNK> ' btw and to <UNK> john lennon <UNK> is what happens while you're making other plans <UNK> the lack of philosophical depth in the prior comment but eventually the plot unfolds to reveal just that br br and speaking <UNK> as if things aren't <UNK> and negative enough john carradine the un named grave <UNK> pops up in a cameo role in the middle of the flick <UNK> that <UNK> basically is meaningless and is only worth living as a poor alternative to the eventual ultimate disappointment br br so here we are over 200 words in and i haven't really had a kind word so why the heck did i rate it so high well there is a lot of tragedy and bunch of moral worth in it there's <UNK> <UNK> true friendships true <UNK> almost love and despite limitations of 50s production <UNK> it is very well sound staged pleasing both the eye and ear and very well <UNK> paced the acting is for the most part uniformly very good  given it's a 50s costume drama and the interactions are believable right down to the characters' fatal flaws which abound and in that doing justice to the best of greek tragedy br br there is some redemption does discover and embrace his son  played by tommy whom despite <UNK> best efforts really needed <UNK> to pull it off a couple of other souls get their just <UNK>  the <UNK> <UNK>  apparently in egypt on a <UNK> exploitation work study <UNK> whom earlier <UNK> even mercilessly <UNK> and the princess gene tierney as <UNK> sister whom knew a deep dark secret about <UNK> and then tried to use it to set him against his friend her brother the <UNK>  nice people huh br br performance is actually something to behold he carries off the <UNK> well enough that somewhere before the end of the <UNK> you want to <UNK> him across the <UNK> grab him by the <UNK> and say look <UNK> pull yourself together the glass ain't half empty it's half full <UNK> then finding that you're personally disappointed in truly best friend victor mature as top soldier for himself having that flaw in his character that <UNK> him <UNK> at doing something positive br br i wonder if the secret to the whole movie is that it very quickly achieves and then <UNK> the necessary suspension of disbelief and early on gets you understanding and worrying about the characters caring to the point that you really feel sorry for them and their missed chances at happiness a happiness that otherwise wasn't all that far from their grasp br br understand why this one isn't already out on dvd and hope that gets <UNK> soon
<START> not bad but could be loads better also seems to follow a <UNK> <UNK> for crime drama you've got sandra <UNK> as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others you've got her placed with a new partner there's a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway and there's so many lines in the film it makes you want to scream br br however if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath it's gripping and the subplots worked for me well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase
<START> stars danny <UNK> billy crystal anne <UNK> kim kate <UNK> oprah <UNK> and rob <UNK> br br after college class teacher larry crystal wants his ex wife dead and owen <UNK> wants his <UNK> <UNK> dead when larry brings up that he wants his wife dead owen knows what he must do for him in order for a favor in return for larry to kill his mother <UNK> is absolutely hilarious in this as the brain dead wannabe writer that has <UNK> of <UNK> his mom and sticking <UNK> through her head he has a child like role that makes him seem more of a confused man than a killer was actually nominated for an academy award for this because of her wonderful performance as mean old mrs lift along with having comedy the film also has heart one scene between <UNK> and crystal starts off seemingly as a joke but goes deeper actually making me slightly sad danny <UNK> directed the film and did a good job getting the dark tone in to his direction for any fan of comedies i recommend this br br my rating b plus <UNK> mins pg 13 for language sexuality and violence
<START> done in a mock documentary style late 60's <UNK> and supposed <UNK> of the mainstream government are arrested and given a choice upon <UNK> for their wrong <UNK> there is a choice of going to prison for 7 years to life or spending three days and two nights in a southern california desert at punishment park in the 100 degree heat the prisoners are to trek fifty some odd miles to an american flag for their freedom us and state law <UNK> will follow two hours latter if the are captured it means prison br br appearing in this pseudo documentary carmen <UNK> <UNK> mary ellen stan scott turner patrick <UNK> and kent <UNK>
<START> how unfortunate yet also fortunate that two films about pot the cave and the descent should arrive at much the same time sadly for the descent its release in the uk on <UNK> of july <UNK> with the very day of the london underground tube <UNK> terrorist atrocity that killed almost 60 and injured hundreds not a particularly good night weekend to pop out to the cinema especially to see a scary as <UNK> film about likable women being trapped in a deep dark claustrophobic underground <UNK> system the two movies have virtually the same elements a half dozen or so characters lost in a previously <UNK> <UNK> system with no one outside aware they are trapped down there lots of water <UNK> danger then ultimately some vicious human like or human derived creatures determined to prey upon them where the two are so different is that the cave is unreal entirely unbelievable more alien esquire sci fi fantasy adventure than horror or drama the <UNK> <UNK> budgeted british film filmed in southern england though set in the <UNK> is five pair of pants terrifying a heart stopping shocker so stomach turning that people walk out of <UNK> early in shock it knocks off the girls in any old order you genuinely have no idea what to expect next surely not her the descent is also lit in <UNK> manner making it all the more scary unlike the laughably lit cave which resembles a giant magical christmas <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> sized room after room dazzling in <UNK> blue light from who knows where while the <UNK> are employed exclusively in artistically lighting up the <UNK> <UNK> heroes each more puppet like than any team america <UNK> anderson thunderbirds creation fantastic amounts of equipment are carried too yet despite this the <UNK> deep voiced actors clearly forgot to pack any sense of impending danger drama or anything worthy of a horror film it's strictly pg rated and in this instance the actors <UNK> out in exactly the order that everyone expects them to i quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character only getting <UNK> <UNK> out of sequence the cave script is entirely by numbers unlike shakespeare a room full of <UNK> would eventually write it in under a week take a typical exchange between the <UNK> white and black leads that goes how many times have we been in this situation before bud too many replies morris i swear you could hear my suburban london audience gasp at the <UNK> the scariest thing about the cave is that at the end there's a clear opening for 'the <UNK> 'the cave 2 or whatever be afraid be very afraid or instead catch the descent and be truly afraid very very very afraid <UNK>
<START> first of all i wasn't sure who this film was aimed at it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn't understand and find boring there wasn't really much to it bruce willis wasn't stretched as an actor at all he did a lot of <UNK> to the side with that half smile of his unless you are a big fan of his i wouldn't bother and if it's the story you're interested in guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child i would go to see about a boy it has everything this film lacked humor sadness and reality
<START> the glorious edward gets to move up in the world when his <UNK> tells him that he can drop those filthy swedish drama movies and head up stairs to the splatter and gore department excited along with his big for the new type of movies he soon will be going to edit he asks all sorts of questions about the <UNK> his and lunch <UNK> well not really edward is maybe quite the opposite calm <UNK> guy on top of that he got glasses with the exception when he's insane i guess that created a much <UNK> atmosphere br br evil ed is with all reason a swedish movie but somehow a magical force came across the good actors and turned their lovely swedish accents into stereotypical american voices i guess that's some of the expertise an actor needs these days the acting is wooden as in they are <UNK> not well hey what did you actually expect on top of that the movie has a <UNK> <UNK> theme song sounds like its e type in any case this only makes the movie experience worse since i'm fairly harsh against this movie so far there will usually be a breaking point where i tone the level of happiness up but there's really not much to say the <UNK> look good but somehow <UNK> coffee over it and partially destroyed it that's how i look at this movie if the movie ended where edward is taken to a mental <UNK> and they the parts from where he goes insane and kills people the result would have been much better but that's just my radical view i would also like to see more footage from the lose limbs movies br br there are also illogical things to discover in this piece of movie let's to say that the actors really are american living in america why would they then work on a swedish movie like edward did and also that delivery man why is it that he never uses the which is located directly beside him instead he goes away with <UNK> <UNK> at the door good old edward really got some good ears to hear all that while he is editing br br anyway this movie had its moments it's just a shame there were not that many but that doesn't mean i would not recommend it it's a rather cheap movie go ahead and buy it's almost like i see a pattern for the price and the movie on the other side if you like watching dubbed movies getting <UNK> by the second this might be it my verdict would then be a rock solid 4
<START> there is a reason <UNK> of the board got a 2 which is too high this movie flat out is one of the worse movies of all time and i seen my share of rotten films <UNK> of the board stars two of the most annoying actors people today <UNK> top and <UNK> <UNK> smith <UNK> top just isn't funny anymore and wasn't in this piece of trash <UNK> <UNK> smith isn't any better just watch according to jim and you will see a prime example of what i am talking about <UNK> of the board got a 1 from me because that is low as you can go it is that bad i am a little shocked that this piece of junk isn't on the imdb bottom 100 somewhere i would put this in the top 5 on that list but its slowly working its way there
<START> i have not figured out what the chosen title has to do with the movie this is another gathering of monsters just like the house of frankenstein not exactly a masterful plot but universal needed to capitalize again br br dr <UNK> <UNK> stevens is either very ambitious or over the top in the ego department he is working on the cure to keep larry <UNK> from turning into the wolf man somehow count dracula happens to drop by to get a fix on his <UNK> and <UNK> out the good doctor's experiments is the <UNK> of the frankenstein <UNK> energy along the way the kind hearted doctor's blood is <UNK> with that of dracula br br john carradine plays dracula again this time he is more convincing <UNK> <UNK> jr as usual is the <UNK> wolf man glenn strange is the frankenstein monster who has very little to do this outing also with roles are lionel <UNK> and martha
<START> the <UNK> of comic strip <UNK> alex raymond flash gordon was the grand daddy of all sci fi epics this serial is the first time flash was brought to celluloid life despite it's low budget this is a great space opera br br the story begins with earth doomed to apparent destruction when the planet comes <UNK> through space on a <UNK> course maverick scientist dr is headed off for the approaching planet in a self made rocket ship convinced he can do something to stop the runaway <UNK> body he gets some last minute <UNK> in the form of <UNK> <UNK> flash gordon and beautiful <UNK> <UNK> once they reach their problems really begin they run <UNK> of <UNK> emperor <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of his world who has some ambitious plans for earth br br the rest of the serial revolves around desperate attempts to save the earth the <UNK> alien cultures he encounters the allies he makes space ships he flies the battles he fights and the monsters he <UNK> br br brilliantly conceived by raymond flash gordon features classic <UNK> from legendary <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> of famous tales like the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> forrest are seen here you have the dashing handsome hero on a quest to save the kingdom flash the evil king <UNK> the old wise man the lovely damsel in distress <UNK> the seductive <UNK> aura loyal allies plus monsters dragons and <UNK> <UNK> br br flash is a modern robin hood jason or beowulf <UNK> is prince john or <UNK> is helen of <UNK> or or maid marion is <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> are the merry men or the knights of the round table br br you get the idea br br you can't help but notice how many ideas from flash gordon would later <UNK> in star wars the cloud city the ice world the forest moon the <UNK> opening text from the second serial there are others but you get the <UNK> the whole sci fi genre owes a great debt to this timeless classic br br buster is the perfect action hero and i personally think he's better at this sort of role than any of the current crop of action stars he also played buck rogers and tarzan br br charles <UNK> is the <UNK> of diabolical <UNK> as <UNK> sure he seems a bit melodramatic today but that was what audiences expected from their bad guys in the 30's br br jean rogers is our hero's love interest <UNK> <UNK> and i had such a crush on her when i first saw this as a boy i can readily understand why flash always rushed to her rescue she's the quintessential good girl to <UNK> the seductive <UNK> of aura the quintessential bad girl br br the supporting cast seemed perfectly chosen to <UNK> their comic strip counterparts and despite the now silly looking <UNK> there was a lot of thrilling action in this groundbreaking serial br br an all around fun romp and the beginning of the sci fi genre in cinema
<START> well i saw that yesterday and it was much better than the other making off from <UNK> too bad than this one it's pretty outdated but you get to see all the staff who makes south park very interesting stuff br br it's also funny than this documentary portrays <UNK> and matt like selfish greedy <UNK> creators who doesn't work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing which is kinda ironic because they work pretty hard on the show br br it also shows all the animation process to make a south park episode interview with the actors who brings character's voices and much more br br if you're a fan of south park i highly recommend you this
<START> in all this dogma <UNK> please note that this is the danish masterpiece of the 20th century the humour the fate the sorrow is so clean so simple so touching br br this movie is a masterpiece go see it there's nothing more to say
<START> i'm sure the film contains certain gaps in logic but i was so enthralled by it that i really didn't care the movie plays out like a fun lighthearted teen romp combined with a <UNK> type action flick it's packed with action packed with excitement and has some humorous moments as well sean <UNK> is fun to watch and i haven't seen louis <UNK> jr since i saw in theaters he is a fine underrated actor and i love watching him on screen i just wonder what he's doing now unfortunately he might be starring in a lot of those direct to video flicks hopefully my <UNK> is wrong anyway this is a fun edge of your seat thriller and i definitely suggest you check it out br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> it's a shame this movie is rated pg 13 it is really quite suitable for anyone though young kids might not follow it too well br br it belongs to that wonderful genre of <UNK> comic ghost angel stories that would have to include everything from <UNK> it's a wonderful life to <UNK> wings of desire br br the photography is stunning the acting first rate and wonder of wonders the tone is uplifting br br my only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film the two <UNK> stories seem <UNK> mysterious at first but they resolve themselves a little too nicely for my taste as the director points out in his commentary on the dvd all the ingredients of <UNK> story are on his <UNK> table the symbolism is just a <UNK> too pat for me br br but what a <UNK> my favorite scene has to be when the <UNK> team tries to get breakfast at a diner this is practically theatrical in its magic a tour de force of witty acting subtle playful and positively <UNK> coupled with striking cinematography and an <UNK> eye for the grotesque br br <UNK> is funny touching gorgeous to look at magical with the above <UNK> and has not one single car chase br br an easy nine stars
<START> this is my favorite hal hartley movie all his movies are small gems i love independent movies and i hope hal hartley never goes mainstream or sells out what if the lord jesus did come back and loved his people so much that he could not open the final book and destroy the <UNK> it was nice to see p j harvey in a movie since i am a fan of her music don't watch this if you are a fan of cookie cutter hollywood movies you will be disappointed
<START> it would be something to try and tell someone what <UNK> morgana is very simply about or maybe it isn't <UNK> goes to the <UNK> desert and nearby <UNK> to film <UNK> landscapes and the locals but this is just the <UNK> stroke it's a feat that you either surrender yourself to or you don't he gets into the form of the world around him entirely without a story bound only to certain aspects of written poetry as his camera shooting on supposedly <UNK> film stock wanders like in a pure <UNK> one might even jump to that easy conclusion as he puts up these immense landscapes then moving to more rough <UNK> culture though not the actual <UNK> culture itself and to a point levels too abstract to be able to convey properly here sometimes it takes a while to get along close to a <UNK> through the creation section but a <UNK> in how parts are manipulated either by nature or by broken down machines soon the narration <UNK> from the who by the way does the music for most of his films with the <UNK> <UNK> of actually highly stylized shots adds a whole different level to it it's a hybrid film and it's not easy but the <UNK> are what best comes closest to <UNK> idea of <UNK> truth images he's been out for his whole career br br one wonders if the images end up by the time the second section paradise leading along the words spoken or if it's the other way around you're eyes are moving along with the stills and pans and the <UNK> is close to being religious writing but there's also the music choices how the <UNK> spare singing and low key classical music goes together with leonard cohen and blind faith i think each side ends up <UNK> the other and it's something that still seems like it shouldn't work perhaps that's the draw to it the chances taken in going through desolate <UNK> and the smallest run sections of any kind of <UNK> life in this case the <UNK> of the desert that make it so fascinating if only for the cinematographic sense it's a marvel too <UNK> for the casual photography fan because of <UNK> of technique and some of the strangest images of any <UNK> film there's pans there's long shots there's hand held while driving by the towns there's a bus dozens of miles away that via <UNK> seems only a couple there's full on close ups of fire and a man holding a <UNK> and talking about its radar truly classic <UNK> comedy there's people holding still in fake poses and a man and woman playing inane music but most importantly it ends up feeling at least for me natural for the personal nature of the approach br br i'm sure only <UNK> would know for certain why he made this film as opposed to the simple <UNK> he was already filming even <UNK> started small and he ended up going through many <UNK> to finish it yet this is what makes <UNK> morgana such an amazing feat it will appeal to one depending on what someone brings to it in actually watching it it's definitely unsettling but there's the temptation to want to see it again very soon after just to experience all of the ideas and realities turned <UNK> strange <UNK> yes the word applies here it's one of the truly spectacular art films ever made
<START> this is the classic case of an excellent film being looked over by the american public simply due to the fact it didn't have bruce willis or arnold <UNK> as the lead man adrian quinn does a better <UNK> performance thats right you heard it <UNK> performance in this film than either of those have ever pulled off in their careers well anyway now to the review br br the assignment is loosely based upon the story of carlos the a 1970's radical who <UNK> europe for years before finally being <UNK> by french agents in this adaptation a us naval officer adrian quinn is on leave in israel when he is <UNK> by crack intelligence counter terrorism agency and took in for questioning due to the fact he looks exactly like the this is the one extremely <UNK> part of the film but trust me it doesn't detract from the great value of this film when it is discovered mr <UNK> is not the however he is <UNK> by a hardened cia agent by the name of jack shaw donald sutherland who does his usual <UNK> mysterious government authority figure routine but in a <UNK> manner who has spent his life hunting the and the series of events which follow will <UNK> anyone who watches this film it is chock full of great acting without all the usual action film cliches and one liners and a great plot which will surprise anyone the three leading men quinn sutherland and kingsley carry this film much further than its modest budget would have allowed with anyone else filling their shoes also kudos to the director and his staff the camera angles and cinematography are top notch especially in the action scenes the assignment is better than anyone renting it could ever expect its a pity the film did fairly poorly in the box office otherwise we might see a sequel to this <UNK> espionage thriller br br 9 10 stars this reviewer highly <UNK> it to all potential viewers
<START> most of the silent films i've seen have been serious in nature so it was fun to see one with a comic touch the setting and some of the scenes for the beloved rogue were reminiscent of the <UNK> of <UNK> dame relative to the paris street scenes and the celebration of the <UNK> of john barrymore portrays <UNK> greatest poet <UNK> in a characterization that <UNK> quite <UNK> from virtual slapstick to <UNK> tender that <UNK> into <UNK> bit early in the picture was rather amusing br br it seems that times never change and it's interesting to see the movie make a <UNK> observation nearly a century ago paris has it's fool to reign for one night while everywhere else has one all the time how true br br the appearance of conrad <UNK> in the film was a little surprising for this viewer i've only seen him as major in casablanca oddly one of his very last movies as king louis <UNK> he's a <UNK> obsessed with <UNK> but suspicious and it was a bit unnerving to see how closely he <UNK> brad <UNK> character from the final chapter of the <UNK> of the <UNK> trilogy not exactly <UNK> the confidence a king of france might be expected to bear which is why the <UNK> of duke <UNK> butt seemed all the more plausible until rises to the occasion to put one over on both <UNK> br br i found it interesting that the use of inter title cards was exceedingly spare used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story without them though one would have missed a curious <UNK> it seems carried out his <UNK> from paris at the hostel of the lame flea br br the print i viewed was of exceptional quality the very first film presented in a one hundred action and suspense movie dvd set from mill creek entertainment that's saying something for a film that's now <UNK> years old it's great that movies from the silent era are now finding a wider distribution in this type of commercial format making them accessible to an entirely new generation of movie lovers br br one question did it seem like conrad <UNK> king louis picked his nose on purpose or as an <UNK> gesture that simply remained safe from the cutting room
<START> the <UNK> ms team features two hopeful <UNK> from different sides of the conflict the <UNK> officer and <UNK> the federal new pilot meet in a battle in space throughout the 12 episode series and one movie the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that <UNK> them it features a romeo and juliet romance and <UNK> animation by far one of the best to hit american <UNK> suit up
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> a wealthy american woman and her two children are kidnapped by murderous desert pirates who <UNK> the <UNK> government and by doing so kidnap american <UNK> which <UNK> the attention of u s president theodore <UNK> <UNK> historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar somewhat <UNK> <UNK> to the desert <UNK> films of the 1940s with a bit of the king and i <UNK> besides portraying the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> leader and his <UNK> <UNK> captive sean connery and <UNK> <UNK> could be acting in two entirely different movies neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp elements of their characters and dialogue and both seem <UNK> without proper direction the various and anonymous <UNK> and <UNK> which occur are <UNK> we don't know any of these victims and the big action scenes become <UNK> <UNK> montages of sand swept violence on <UNK> the <UNK> a much <UNK> music score by jerry <UNK> oscar nominated but a loser to john <UNK> jaws fine location shooting and cinematography 1 2 from
<START> oh my poor jane must have done the old rolling over in the grave thing even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of mini series this is <UNK> whatever else you do with austen the dialog should <UNK> even in this perhaps her most serious work and melodrama should be strictly out of <UNK> alas not the case with this production by the time you get to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you'll either be laughing or crying unless you're just out to visually collect all <UNK> films of <UNK> work you can skip this one if you do watch it however there are small the actresses playing <UNK> sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles
<START> this film always hits me hard emotionally at the end though the issues of the film <UNK> romance and adultery were controversial at the time this film goes way beyond those narrow <UNK> of ground breaking novelty and trail blazing <UNK> here we have a true love story as written by the woman involved in this love affair told in a brilliant aggressive style that <UNK> the virtues and glory of mad passionate love i love this <UNK> of the only emotion that makes life truly worth living jennifer jones is full of grace and william <UNK> is simply magnificent in his role as a reporter a wonderful film that only people who have been in this kind of love can really appreciate and understand and for those who haven't yet been in love even just the hope that one day lightning can strike for you makes life worth living because love is worth having even if but for a short time even if you lose because love is the stuff the essence of life this film works for me a <UNK> felt experience
<START> don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie <UNK> you you'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes however if for no other reason see <UNK> to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he <UNK> life into his role ralph richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle shakespeare rather he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed he was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor his reading of the part of the sixth lord of <UNK> his last performance is to be <UNK> by all who love the theatre
<START> one of the most famous of all movie serials still interesting today although it does have an old movie look to it the second serial looks better but simply does not equal this one actors have a good time especially <UNK> and great editing by the universal expert crew the musical score was <UNK> in from <UNK> destination unknown the invisible man the black cat and werewolf of london and what great action music it was if there was a choice for all time best serial this arguably should be 1
<START> unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on my jaw dropped when i read the positive reviews of this film i cannot believe that this film was even released it's so bad br br i admit it is not my kind of movie but i tried to watch it <UNK> anyway you know so bad it's funny and was still offended at its sheer awfulness br br the acting is atrocious they can't have watched the rushes and i'm guessing there was one take per scene it really is that terrible it is the worst film i have seen in many a year in fact i wouldn't even call it a film it's a tragedy the gay black friend whom no one actually calls gay it's just implied because he's so crazy <UNK> this is not good in fact this is downright vomit inducing the jokes die on their pathetic <UNK> the music is so bad it defies belief the person who <UNK> the soundtrack essentially chose the most ear bad songs they had ever heard and put them in this waste of film stock oh my good christ i can't believe the 80's produced utter garbage like this i grew up through them and i cannot find one thing worth of note here it must have been a dark time to be a cinema goer br br if you even contemplate watching this film go see a psychiatrist he will then <UNK> slap you you sick sick person
<START> but not this one i always wanted to know what happened next we will never know for sure what happened because <UNK> was <UNK> baby i am a <UNK> fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more <UNK> by the movie i did compare scarlett to the original <UNK> because any film worth following <UNK> needed to be on the same quality level as the first <UNK> was cast beautifully although no one will ever compare to mr gable i am also a strict <UNK> leigh fan she was scarlett she fit the bill not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with scarlett the job could have been done better not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett that was evident br br overall something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and <UNK> i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction this movie is not worth the time
<START> i have used this movie in my college <UNK> <UNK> for over 10 years also woody allen's crimes and another terrific multi <UNK> <UNK> study br br it's fiction i don't focus too much on the unrealistic features of strangers because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels i love the film as <UNK> comedy <UNK> told with many ironic twists and visual pleasures even if it's unbelievable the story is told so well that i don't even think of <UNK> its <UNK> although i must confess that the <UNK> match seems the weakest part to me too much hollywood fluff and not enough real <UNK> competition br br some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and <UNK> discussion br br 1 <UNK> <UNK> some weaknesses of the guy character are intended by hitchcock a primary <UNK> insight of the film is the danger of inability to <UNK> one's moral positions guy is unable to effectively block <UNK> crazy <UNK> at the start an interesting question is why and how does guy behave so <UNK> <UNK> a possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process br br 2 <UNK> guy commits another failure at the start on the train to get away quickly he agrees that <UNK> ideas are all good but guy's literal meaning is opposite to his <UNK> sarcastic meaning bruno takes the literal meaning as an <UNK> for the <UNK> cross murders guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder <UNK> to some extent near the beginning bruno may be partially pretending that an <UNK> has been struck to draw guy further into a web of <UNK> bruno is <UNK> guy guy's <UNK> ambiguity on the train gives bruno a chance to put an <UNK> on guy bruno <UNK> guy may also take on other meanings br br 3 <UNK> some have <UNK> about a sexual relationship between guy and bruno it seems at first ridiculous especially since guy appears obviously <UNK> in his relationships with <UNK> and anne however remember that guy is also <UNK> with both women guy appears <UNK> it's 1951 remember <UNK> especially in relationship to bruno guy the strong <UNK> is weak on the inside bruno is also conflicted playing against himself appearing <UNK> and physically strong at first but then displaying some <UNK> traits <UNK> fashion and <UNK> his <UNK> emotionally to guy in different situations his receiving a <UNK> from his <UNK> mother bruno kissing and desperately <UNK> his mother's hand other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold <UNK> meaning from hitchcock's point of view i wish i could hear hitchcock <UNK> his intended meanings here br br 4 <UNK> and <UNK> guy makes some <UNK> <UNK> in hiding truths about bruno from family and from police guy fails to fully comprehend that <UNK> fault quickly may be better than a cover up or a <UNK> in confession again guy is driven by <UNK> <UNK> fear and perhaps a self hate that is closer to <UNK> own self loathing than we care to see or to admit both guy and bruno act out their own <UNK> of <UNK> br br 5 lack of evidence guy feels a problem the evidence to <UNK> himself while quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem guy traps himself with his own doubts and <UNK> the absence of desired <UNK> the inability of the alcoholic professor to <UNK> on guy's behalf the obsessive need to appear politically <UNK> and other personality factors that cause guy to feel <UNK> he is as dysfunctional as bruno just not as dangerous yet one could partially blame guy for murder br br 6 disease and mental disorder an interesting question is how <UNK> responsible is bruno for the murders the more <UNK> incompetent bruno is as a sick <UNK> the more guilty guy may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes guy's failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death ensues one could argue that more than one crime is committed and that guy is an emotionally <UNK> <UNK> br br these and many other features of the film make strangers on a train a gem of a morality play a diamond for philosophical and cinematic <UNK>
<START> an example of all of the worst gay stereotypes all in one movie br br and charles why do you speak in that weird pseudo british high brow accent and insist that the kid speak that way too did anyone else notice that all of the soundtrack music is exactly the same you should stick with the good old hollywood camp drag stuff that you are so good at die <UNK> die ii the sequel i don't see the value of spending time and money on a project like this there are so many real life gay youth stories to be told and we should be seeing those not this garbage <UNK> what a waste of time embarrassing example of gay cinema
<START> far from combining the best bits of and 28 days this managed to ignore them whilst shamelessly <UNK> them if that makes sense was different and got <UNK> this just stinks the radio dj we must stay on air spends effectively no time on air he sits on his bottom and watches the tv for news this is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever is there a single person in the usa or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is or ever heard of the word zombie well by the <UNK> minute this bunch of <UNK> are still calling the zombies the infected ones or the ones with the word zombie might make a guest appearance later i could care less maybe there's a <UNK> where you have to pay to use certain words like the <UNK> <UNK> is called the ear <UNK> i kid you not to finish no plot no acting no one cares a waste of time a shameless poorly executed rip off
<START> i don't think i really have any spoilers in here but since i do describe a couple of funny scenes i'll check the box saying contain just to be on the safe side now br br i hardly know where to start by now you know the basic outline of the story horse <UNK> travis ben johnson and sandy harry carey jr take the job of <UNK> a mormon <UNK> train west to their <UNK> and along the way encounter a variety of trials and interesting characters most notably the outlaw <UNK> family br br anyone can enjoy this movie you don't have to be a fan of westerns to like this one for one thing johnson and carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie carey in particular is animated and <UNK> almost like a big kid while johnson is a little <UNK> and <UNK> kind of like an older brother figure i get a kick out of the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their <UNK> for ten dollars then inform him that the horse has some <UNK> you might say <UNK> travis <UNK> sandy who lets loose with a shrill <UNK> sending the <UNK> new horse off on a wild <UNK> fit with him in the <UNK> the look on his face as the horse finally <UNK> him and <UNK> away is priceless br br pay attention to the music even if you never thought you'd be a fan of the sons of the <UNK> listen to shadows in the dust as the <UNK> train is shown in motion with some of the people walking along between the <UNK> it's a truly beautiful song too bad only half a minute or so of it is in the movie i want to hear the whole thing sometime br br one thing that impressed me greatly about this movie is that much of it must have been almost as hard to make as the real situation it portrays teams of six horses pulling <UNK> up <UNK> mountain <UNK> <UNK> to make the top this was no simple and easy film it must have been <UNK> for the actors the stunt people and the animals as well rivers too this movie has plenty of authentic looking action involving the movement of the <UNK> train it should be mentioned that both harry carey jr and ben johnson were extremely competent riders both with many <UNK> experience riding and doing all manner of cowboy type things carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many indians and in fact he learned to speak before he learned to speak english no <UNK> in this movie travis and sandy were the real thing through and through br br watch for the scene when miss denver throws out the pan of water from her <UNK> hitting <UNK> horse in the face the horse starts <UNK> eventually throwing him off it watch the look on <UNK> face when denver tells travis <UNK> sorry you fell off your horse ' another favorite scene of mine is when harry carey jr sandy gets into a bit of a <UNK> with one of the <UNK> they're working back to back getting their gear ready and after sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow the two of them get into a rear end <UNK> match that quickly turns into a rolling around on the ground fist fight even after the elder ward bond stands them up and <UNK> them the two <UNK> continue trying to get at each other the mormon named <UNK> in the film gets one final kick in at sandy so high it hits his shoulder it's a really funny scene from start to finish br br i don't know what else i can say about this movie other than that it has a good story very engaging characters beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama oh it has been <UNK> at least in the version i saw not the most beautiful color film you'll ever see but i think i prefer it to black and white i give this one a ten and i don't give out many <UNK> one of my favorite movies without a doubt and judging by the other comments i have plenty of company in that <UNK>
<START> watching this movie and then listening to the commentary it's clear that michael <UNK> doesn't understand this play the first clue that he fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes pains to set the film in <UNK> century <UNK> which sounds truly odd yes that <UNK> the film would mean trying to make it as accurate to its location as possible but anyone who's studied shakespeare knows that while he set most of his plays in exotic locals the culture and values are always contemporary england this doesn't hurt the film but it displays a lack of necessary knowledge br br where <UNK> kills the film is in making it so dead serious he manages to suck every joke out of the script leaving the whole production flat every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters even <UNK> we not speech is a mild awkward <UNK> from a <UNK> who seems to only be saying and doing what he does because he's supposed to the lovers are <UNK> and far too restrained joseph <UNK> delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely <UNK> <UNK> who has to promise to behave at one point is more sober and <UNK> than who makes him promise to behave jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with <UNK> <UNK> br br in the commentary for the bland and watered down court scene the director voices his shock that an audience laughed at 'a pound of flesh no more no <UNK> sentence ultimately <UNK> that it had to tension release laughter 'the <UNK> of is a comedy and <UNK> <UNK> at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical portions of the story are anything but the most <UNK> provocative drama br br the film has no <UNK> focus yet cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes the characters are forced into high drama <UNK> so they come out sounding like <UNK> characters reading victorian poetry and the comedic ending where all of the good guys go to bed happy is drowned in a <UNK> despair that feels like they're finding stiff upper lip peace with impending death rather than <UNK> with lovers even <UNK> and antonio exit the film holding their hats like <UNK> <UNK> br br the film is poorly done because the creative powers that be don't understand the script it is stern where it should hysterical it is reserved where it should be passionate it is michael <UNK> where it should be william shakespeare
<START> now the television <UNK> in england at least are <UNK> with home improvement bargain hunting house hunting and <UNK> shows in the <UNK> the chances of any of the <UNK> <UNK> digging out a complete obscurity like this to <UNK> a couple of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are <UNK> to say the least but back in the eighties the bbc did just that and guess what i watched it and it's a testament to the overwhelming weirdness of this hungarian american co production that i can still remember large <UNK> of it over twenty years later to begin with the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles only to <UNK> again for at least half an hour imagine an american tail re edited so is nowhere to be seen and you'll appreciate how confusing this is there's a <UNK> bizarre bit of animation where one of the characters gets his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and stretched complete with a sound effect that causes him to go boss eyed probably hilarious if you're stoned but to a child quite disturbing speaking of which the infamous scene is represented in an abstract manner clouds in vague <UNK> <UNK> are struck by lightning but it's still pretty unpleasant in fact this film is pretty cold and <UNK> throughout a sad state of affairs hardly helped by the strange looking production design all <UNK> colours <UNK> lines <UNK> forms and that uniquely european <UNK> reminiscent of jan <UNK> only not as compelling then to cap it all we get songs by the this isn't so much an awful film as a deeply misguided one not so much <UNK> as a rather bad trip
<START> i really don't know why i agreed to watch this movie but like a complete fool i did and for that i deserve to be shot i had seen the original <UNK> well i say i have seen it i started watching it but found it that bad that i ended up watching it in <UNK> speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue but i said i would watch it and i did even if it was in <UNK> speed br br to cut a long story short <UNK> 2 kicks off where <UNK> left off by this i don't mean the plot i mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and <UNK> i have nothing against low budget movies in fact i kinda enjoy them they are something different from mega budget blockbusters but this film is just terrible the acting is diabolical and the script well i think you could of given <UNK> wonder a pen and paper and he would of produced something much better this movie is just annoying not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed i didn't make it through this movie anyway about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window it may of been a rip off to buy as a dvd but as a <UNK> it was a mega bargain br br please for the love of mankind itself do not watch this <UNK> it is possibly the worst thing i have ever seen and considering some of the <UNK> i've seen thats saying a lot br br my rating on this movie would be <UNK> to the head 10
<START> this is not a film to impress you with high budget high tech shots fast camera movements or <UNK> costumes thought by an <UNK> and hungry director but it's a film by a director who is also a very good photographer who has a very good sense of looking at things as a human not as an half god unlike most of the directors this is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best <UNK> with unreal or at best learned gestures and <UNK> rather it's a film in which they act as real as it can be actually they are not professional actors at all the dialogues between the main characters their expressions their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life you tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regrets that you avoid to express with words you show the same signs of <UNK> to an <UNK> guest this is the same feeling of that you get in modern city life and this is your chance to see yourself from outside <UNK> by the main characters i saw all of the films of <UNK> <UNK> his short film thanks to those who puts it in the dvd many would compare him with <UNK> <UNK> and maybe <UNK> or bergman as he is <UNK> as a true auteur and he is sincere in saying that his films are not to make money but to give a meaning to his life that is the kind of sincerity you'll find in
<START> is this a good movie it's hard to say but in 1953 for many people it was a remarkably effective movie suspenseful scary and then amazingly actually touching when the old gentleman meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie br br yes what <UNK> in the <UNK> turns out to be something of a surprise and for a lot of people a hilarious one but the basic idea <UNK> was a very real one at the time the book was written and does have some basis in fact not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie of course br br but working on what must have been a very low budget one of the greatest production <UNK> and the person for whom the term production designer was invented creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling at times of course the movie is very silly but it has its moments
<START> while i read all of the complaints about this movie before i saw it i still had interest from the preview i don't know if it was because i was expecting a bomb or what but i really enjoyed the movie the i was not very frightened at all until the second half of the movie but even then it wasn't very bad at all i think that most of the scenes and false <UNK> were realistic if a little too <UNK> but it was necessary to move the story along i think that the house and surrounding area is the perfect setting for this type of movie it is beautiful and huge but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary i also think that the light <UNK> worked extremely well because not only did they turn on upon entry but there was no way to keep them on so the house stayed dark outside of the small section jill was in br br speaking of jill i thought her part was acted pretty well at first it wasn't as believable but after a few phone calls it was fine in fact the scenes where she is frightened are acted perfectly and finally someone got the fire poker right i can't tell you how many times when i hear a noise at my house i grab the fire poker and it was a nice touch for her to do the same even though she <UNK> forgets it when she needs it most br br in regards to the plot holes the movie is not perfect but almost every hole can be explained and part of the mystery is how he got in exactly how long was he watching her how did he get out to kill her friend and when exactly did the <UNK> die overall i enjoyed it and i was surprised how quickly it went it kept my attention and i wanted to see how it ended although the ending was very brief and left a bad taste in my mouth my only complaint other than the ending was the lack of character development they could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel bad for her situation more to give us a taste of her personality and to give us <UNK> to how she will handle the situation for example the scene where she <UNK> whether to go back for the kids it looks like some scene is missing at the beginning that talked about her only caring about herself or something
<START> loved the story of a guy that tries to get his girl back been there done that so i can relate any way i love the camera work how occasionally the camera gets left on and they are just sitting there talking about the scene or other stuff or how the camera follows him around to find the cast and what not i watched this on <UNK> sometime last year and i loved it so i told a few of my friends about it and some of them watched it and they too loved it check it out if you can kinda <UNK> but its still a good film i gave it a 10 10 because of two reasons one i can relate but anyone that has ever fallen in love and made a mistake can relate two its a really creative way to make a film its like you are constantly there right in the middle of filming like i said great film
<START> spoilers ahead my late childhood had two cinematographic icons star wars and this film by czech genius <UNK> <UNK> a jules <UNK> <UNK> where century <UNK> come to life in exquisite black and white photography combined with stop motion and conventional animation <UNK> spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film as well as a very modern questioning on the moral limits of power and advanced technology in fact it brings atomic energy into <UNK> universe in a very and elegant way also and elegant is the demise of the villain with a probably nuclear explosion sending his hat flying over the sea the resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfactory something very rare today when a lot of films don't seem to know how to end themselves br br i was fortunate to catch this gem in reruns on local tv in the late 70s it enhanced my enjoyment of <UNK> fiction and of cinema br br 10 out of 10 for <UNK> <UNK> under appreciated master of imagination
<START> one of the major aspects of vera called little vera in english is that it was the first movie from the soviet union that featured a sex scene albeit a short one the title is important vera is the russian word for faith <UNK> that punk vera has little faith in the soviet system and as the movie shows there's not much faith to be had in it the opening scene shows the bleak industrial town of nearly a hell on earth when <UNK> lover <UNK> moves in with her family it leads to some unexpected events br br like in many russian movies people's names describe their characters for example there's <UNK> remember that victor means winner all in all this is a good look at the soviet union while it was <UNK> and we can see why it was <UNK> really good
<START> coming from <UNK> this art house visual and sound exposition is a surprise for a director known for his <UNK> and keen observation of humans especially children this <UNK> into <UNK> cinematography begs for questions why did he do it was it to keep him busy during a vacation at the shore br br five 5 long takes consists of you guessed it five long takes they are the title names are my own and the times <UNK> br br <UNK> and waves the camera stands nearly still looking at a small piece of <UNK> as it gets moved around by small waves <UNK> on a beach ten minutes br br watching people on the <UNK> the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a <UNK> people walk across the camera frame their faces too far and <UNK> to make them interesting eleven minutes br br six dogs at the <UNK> edge the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby far away at the <UNK> edge six dogs not doing much just relaxing sixteen minutes br br <UNK> in line <UNK> of <UNK> the camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon near the <UNK> edge dozen and dozen of <UNK> stream in single file from left to right i assume that <UNK> released them gradually the last two <UNK> stop dead on their track and suddenly a <UNK> of <UNK> rolls quietly from right to left i assume <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and re released all at the same time it is not the first time that he deals with the contrast between organized and <UNK> behavior eight minutes br br frog <UNK> <UNK> i mean <UNK> for a <UNK> night the camera stands over a pond at night it's pitch black except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the <UNK> water it is a <UNK> night and clouds race to cover the moon the screen goes dark what remains for us is the <UNK> of <UNK> howling dogs and eventually morning hit me on the head if this was done in a single take i saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple <UNK> twenty seven minutes br br except for the mildly amusing <UNK> this exercise in <UNK> left me cold a film for <UNK> <UNK> br br i thought i would rate five a five but four is what it deserves br br the film is dedicated to <UNK>
<START> i was <UNK> into watching shark hunter by the comments posted on imdb the movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah so i rented it bad idea this movie was bad on so many levels that i'm glad that i had the option to fast forward the shark itself is ok it's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1 i gave it a 2 the acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as <UNK> i wasn't expecting much but i was continually surprised by this <UNK> antonio <UNK> jr is some kind of <UNK> or scientist or something i wasn't really paying attention he goes down with the <UNK> crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course by the way all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater first of all if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station what's with all the huge <UNK> <UNK> and the and stuff are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident the shark theory was advanced by antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against antonio and this young college student horrible actress by the way just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble what is with that unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school i find this a little silly the director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone <UNK> in the background metal <UNK> is very important when your on a sub i guess anyway i could go on but i've said too much already bottom line go to your local video store rent this video and then destroy it then send email asking imdb to remove all record of this movie from their site all memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed we can do it if we work together
<START> when you watch the making of with this dvd they tell you what is attempted here they are retelling the bible story of good versus evil trying to <UNK> it to a main stream movie audience in a modern society such as <UNK> this is where the film fails there are way too many sheep depicted in this movie people are too <UNK> for this type of preaching today br br as far as the acting directing technical functions they are done ok chuck norris actually is ok as an angel as the unpredictable appearance of norris as an angel is no more absurd than tommy <UNK> was in the 1960's sit com
<START> originally i wrote what was a sarcastic <UNK> review of this pathetic piece of dung but every time i <UNK> the review i got this contains a very long word which is not allowed also words that were not <UNK> were judged incorrect br br now the word that was judged too long was never identified after numerous attempts at <UNK> words eventually i got the <UNK> suspicion that the imdb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically nothing i wrote was obscene or racist in itself but after <UNK> all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and again also words that weren't judged <UNK> were all the sudden considered <UNK> br br the pc police are everywhere
<START> wow not in a good way br br i can't believe people dig this trash most of the shows on television are pretty bad and this has been a running trend for a while now they just keep getting worse but las vegas definitely takes it home what a terrible show br br the actors are a bunch of has been c losers that never went anywhere except james <UNK> who knows what he was thinking when he signed on to this <UNK> so its not their fault that this show sucks they just can't help it blame the producers and the writers i can't believe they shot this and were actually proud enough of their work to air it
<START> as an indie filmmaker i try to at least make a decent film this piece of was beyond low budget it was shot on video and not mini <UNK> at least the look and feel of this was just <UNK> i met the director a few years ago at <UNK> <UNK> in la and he was talking about that book film making for <UNK> that he was putting together i thought this little video was going to be something but i guess i was wrong he could have brought the value up a little by shooting <UNK> film instead of that awful video the plot was stupid as well as the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine <UNK> i had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice damn i did buy <UNK> which was a hell of a movie maybe the director should read real motion picture books on film making and not try to cut <UNK> when trying to make a low budget flick maybe he should learn from the masters who made night of the living dead and the evil dead and chain saw massacre just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits this is one video that should have stayed dead i cannot call it a film because he did not use film
<START> what movie is this a horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the <UNK> camp the movie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the movie has no base it just goes like this <UNK> an are married and living in a rich mansion however <UNK> doesn't like to the heart as he wants only her wealth he loves someone else tara <UNK> so he <UNK> <UNK> to have an affair with so that he could catch them and finally split up with how boring however <UNK> falls in love with and vice versa lastly when gets <UNK> for killing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tries to save her showing his false love to her on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he loved her truly so she lends all her wealth to <UNK> finally <UNK> comes out of the police station and goes with tara with all the wealth what a fraud the songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie now the individual ratings out of 5 <UNK> 1 2 <UNK> 1 2 overall acting 1 2 direction story music 1 2 final rating 1 2 poor performances and poor casting music good i rate the movie 1 5 10 dont waste your time
<START> believe it or not this was at one time the worst movie i had ever seen since that time i have seen many more movies that are worse how is it possible therefore to be fair i had to give this movie a 2 out of 10 but it was a tough call
<START> i liked this movie unlike other thrillers you learn to know the killers very well you also get to know the two detectives hunting them the killers are two high school kids they are very intelligent and want to prove they are smarter than the police so they plan the perfect crime we all know this crime will not turn out perfect what we don't know is if they will be caught or may be just one of them or even none in a way i kind of hoped they both would get away with it although i don't know if this was the movies intention br br the story is told in a nice way you are starting to get to know the people involved the character of sandra <UNK> is likable but has her own secret which works against her ben chaplin is pretty good as sam and the two kids are both great the scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie br br i think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think for a nice evening with a movie <UNK> by is a good one
<START> this is one of the worst movies ever made i can't believe how bad it was i was shocked at the awfulness of the <UNK> masks they are obviously halloween masks the mouths don't even move when they talk why did they feel the need to make the <UNK> comical and goofy whenever they do anything there seems to be this circus like music and <UNK> <UNK> and noises when they hit people the bondage <UNK> lady is one of the worst actresses i have ever seen this movie is just bad the plot is nonexistent the mom from one tree hill is in this though and she has obviously had a nose job since this was made why did the main character from the first movie return to make this garbage bad bad bad movie
<START> what does this movie have lots of <UNK> and expensive effects nothing makes sense on any other level br br watching arnold cry is seeing acting so bad that it is laughable the plot is ludicrous br br if you think the devil will be impressed by a bad actor with a machine gun well this movie is for you
<START> i am a massive hitchcock fan ever since seeing rear window on television <UNK> is not hitchcock's best for me though it is very good but not a masterpiece it does have its faults some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather <UNK> but hitchcock's direction is superb and the performances weren't that bad while robert <UNK> and <UNK> lane both do a good enough job otto <UNK> and norman lloyd come very close to stealing the show the story is good about a <UNK> man on the run very similar themes used in <UNK> steps and north by <UNK> and cleverly provides some much needed <UNK> the music score was absolutely outstanding the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal almost like a distorted march and i liked the <UNK> at <UNK> 1st piano <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the cinematography is also crisp and smooth the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes namely the statue of liberty climax but the circus <UNK> encounter and the radio music city hall shoot out is also on the money overall not hitchcock's best but definitely worth the look 8 10 <UNK> cox
<START> okay it's too long and it's too satisfied with itself still the great dictator is a fascinating movie chaplin does a terrific job <UNK> hitler and trying to portray the <UNK> of the jews in nazi germany this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge not a chaplin masterpiece but still worth seeing br br
<START> this film is little more than an <UNK> verhoeven the filming is supposed to be <UNK> realistic but is simply sickening the parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously the <UNK> pauses for non existent <UNK> <UNK> are tedious and even painful undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film <UNK> it was just an accident which happened like that if you want to see a parody of reality tv watch celebrity <UNK> it's funnier and <UNK> and most importantly shorter i have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film to be avoided like a <UNK> rabbit
<START> i usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as i do watching the film but with today you die i feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time br br so here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is br br there was a time in the mid 80s when a single look from steven seagal was enough to crack your <UNK> a full on <UNK> could knock you off your feet if he actually got a hold of you he would snap you like a <UNK> br br these days although he is still capable of doing considerable damage he no longer looks the part he's gone to seed and just doesn't know when to call it <UNK> he walks like he's dumped in his pants yet somehow still manages to look <UNK> and he has put on weight his trademark long <UNK> has gone but his hair still looks stupid how this man keeps on working in the movie industry is beyond me br br today you die is the usual seagal mix of bone <UNK> fights car crashes gun battles and <UNK> seagal <UNK> his way through the dull script delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability in this third rate action flick he plays <UNK> banks a thief trying to go straight who is <UNK> into <UNK> in a 20 000 000 robbery he gets caught goes to jail escapes and seeks revenge yawn br br there are some pretty good car chases and gun fights which <UNK> the boring stuff of which there is a lot but reading other comments on imdb has revealed that these were actually borrowed from other better movies seagal is also body <UNK> an awful lot in this one br br seagal turns in one of the most dreadful performances of his that's saying something considering the lousy <UNK> in some of his recent efforts most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt at <UNK> african american street <UNK> 'i da man actually steven you sound like an <UNK> with a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere this film is a waste of time money and effort and the final moment where <UNK> banks saves a children's home from closure is enough to make you blow <UNK> br br damn i just looked at the clock i was enjoying <UNK> this steaming pile of dreck so much i went way over my five minutes it's time to post this comment and get to watching something decent
<START> <UNK> based on the true story of charlie wilson an american <UNK> who according to this movie was <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> war in afghanistan against the soviet union br br comments a rather funny movie about not so funny things especially since they were real but focusing on the movie hanks performs very well as a mischievous <UNK> <UNK> with a good heart that becomes the champion for the <UNK> war in afghanistan hanks and the entire movie philip hoffman especially has a rather humorous tone so much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are serious indeed br br a story of what happened with some questions about what might have been so the movie works as a comedy if you want one and a much more serious one if you want that something for everybody 7 10
<START> one would think that since this film has a bad <UNK> that i would be <UNK> when i say i hated this film but i'm am serious this movie was just so stupid and so unfunny and such a waste of time i mean after the first 30 i had a major headache and the smile i had on my face that was mostly getting ready to laugh was wearing off when this film was over i was so glad and because i had good expectations that it would be funny i was extremely disappointed the acting is not great the comedy moments are lame and unfunny hardly anything is good about this because i laughed at like maybe 2 parts overall this is so boring and i can't tell you how awful this is i think this could be used as a suicide technique i mean i don't think for some its even watchable so my final words on this are avoid at all costs
<START> this is one worth watching although it is sometimes cheesy it is great to see a young sean <UNK> and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie i watched it many times when i was young and now still enjoy it when i pop the old vhs into the machine i happen to own a copy so sit back with this movie let reality go for a little while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half
<START> if you've ever been to <UNK> this movie is absolutely hilarious from teenagers wearing gold chains listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air <UNK> in cars and <UNK> in total shock over meeting a <UNK> this movie really captures bits and pieces of <UNK> that you would never know unless you went there i spent most of the movie <UNK> my head and thinking yep that's exactly right it's a lot of fun if you understand russian too because the subtitles just don't always do it justice the actors are so believable and <UNK> wood does a great job playing a socially inept jewish kid my favorite character is definitely sammy davis jr jr the <UNK> seeing eye dog who is really a <UNK> border <UNK> the characters are so <UNK> and likable that you believe that they are real people
<START> <UNK> is playing with the audience with the story of max vincent <UNK> in search of his biggest lost love monica <UNK> just before to get engaged to another woman uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's <UNK> it can get very confusing still a strong film debut for beautifully photographed by <UNK> the <UNK> element the <UNK> and monica <UNK> is a darling to watch i felt a little disappointed near the end so i gave it 9 out of 10
<START> this is one of the worst sandra <UNK> movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad i really lost it with those out of the blue not so special effect guys if you're an <UNK> go with your girl to see this movie i give it three
<START> this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies in the history of cinema the screenplay is really well done which is not often the case for this type of movies and you can see that chuck in one of his first role is a great actor the final fight with the <UNK> deputy in the is a masterpiece
<START> i'm rating this pretty high just because of sam elliott i could've done without the female nudity but i'd sit through almost any nonsense in order to see sam <UNK> his stuff he gets to <UNK> wonderfully cynical <UNK> many of which i agree with and it's a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to <UNK> instead of just standing around <UNK> and looking <UNK> as can be my boyfriend <UNK> that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which ed harris had a hispanic partner in the police sense of the term who was a little to prove himself you can draw your own conclusions on that score but if you like sam you'll like this you could say i'm biased but who isn't in some way i'd buy this on dvd in a <UNK>
<START> the only entertaining thing that i found about watching this movie was listening to star wars coming through the wall of the movie theatre yes i go to a really bad movie theatre this movie is so mind numbingly bad that i think i would rather have my eyes <UNK> out by a cat rather than watch it again br br let's compare it to the original one is charming funny exciting well acted and one of the best movies ever made the other is so far from funny that all you can do is hope that your <UNK> will fall out so you don't have to watch any more i'm sorry christina <UNK> is a fine actress but cannot compare with mills and don't even get me started on doug e doug in a part one occupied by the amazing and absolutely charming dean jones dean jones' tiny part in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie and it is the only reason i can justify a 1 rating also because the imdb doesn't go into <UNK>
<START> forever strong is a type of film we've seen many time before just in different types of genres however that being said i really thought it was a great film sean <UNK> is showing the type of potential that usually lands actors into big time stardom apparently this film got a limited release as i wasn't even aware of it but i saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance with it after i remember enjoying <UNK> performance in never back down i ended up making a great decision i'm not a fan of <UNK> what so ever but the film really isn't fully about <UNK> it's about making a stand in you're life challenging yourself reaching your goals there is a whole lot more then the simple plot suggests at 1st we don't give a damn about what happens to rick he's <UNK> full of himself and completely arrogant we feel he's completely sealed his fate as a trouble maker along the way we see the changes in his character he starts to hang around with better people he starts to better himself we learn how much negative impact his father has had in his life it's just a great <UNK> and the film did a great job of turning rick from cocky <UNK> to a good hearted person br br the <UNK> action itself is not too bad at all unlike the stuff i played and saw in high school this was actually quite fun to watch and beautifully choreographed a great young cast combined with some veteran experience helped this film immensely it just did a fabulous job of avoiding in what could've been a run of the mill type of thing to a poignant and effective drama i also liked the <UNK> contrast between the coach <UNK> cole and rick sean <UNK> it made for a very interesting storyline and i loved seeing him help out rick along the way it was emotional and heartwarming at the same time this is a real hidden gem that i'm truly glad i discovered it made me think about my life and a lot of times i need something like that br br the performances sean <UNK> is outstanding as rick <UNK> he reminded me an awful lot of a young tom cruise cocky yet very charismatic and talented it was a tough role to turn going from a <UNK> teenager to a good hearted young man but sean pulled it off with pure perfection he clearly put his heart and soul into this film so big kudos to sean for putting so much effort into this great film gary cole is excellent as the preachy yet likable coach who wants to help out the kids i've always found him to be likable he always has a sort of presence he carries to his films <UNK> <UNK> is fantastic as the selfish yet <UNK> father of rick for the majority of the movie the script leads you to believe he's nothing more then a selfish bitter man who wants rick to be exactly like him but in the end you start to see the real him come out i felt sorry for him a bit julie warner is a good character actress and she plays the good hearted yet clueless mother well penn is required to play a real jerk and boy does he ever do that well on numerous occasions i wanted to pop him one so i must say it's a great performance <UNK> <UNK> is the love interest not much of a part she did ok nathan west plays a somewhat mysterious character he did quite well sean <UNK> is billed as a major player for the film but he barely does anything he did good with what he had to do br br bottom line forever strong is a great feel good film it will definitely make you stop and think about how your life was much better then you thought don't let this one slip you by you won't regret it br br 8 1 2 10
<START> this movie plays out like an english version of an abc after school special with nudity it makes you wonder who the target audience was supposed to be it's not as though the writers were too <UNK> with selling a plausible plot either while it does possess a certain <UNK> virtual sexuality is <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> it's a good movie to watch if you're <UNK> in the out and it's the only tape you've got
<START> a bad quentin tarantino rip off at least i hope that's what they were going for because at least then i could respect the director for <UNK> tarantino one scene a singing scene with rose is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director so besides his <UNK> inspiration and rose and her one good scene this film sucked some of the <UNK> dialogue i have ever heard i'm willing to bet why doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been tries to be funny never is tries to be dark and isn't tries to be stylish and is just bland who <UNK> out the money to make movies like this i'm hoping it was all the directors so no one else's money was wasted if not for the whole cast is awful and when is your best hmmm i gotta wonder
<START> i really liked this movie if other people want to give it an average around 5 0 10 that's their choice i would give it 10 10 <UNK> performance as a private eye is totally awesome the story is amazing human exciting intelligent the dialogue is good the story might not be perfect but anyway the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for that moreover the ending is incredibly cool and their the <UNK> saw puzzle really comes back to together so anyway i liked it i also thought the female lead actress performed very well i'm not a big fan of detective movies but this one was really good also because it doesn't give a damn about conventions of the supernatural
<START> that is the promise of the trailer i saw and by which i rented <UNK> exactly a serious film viewer shall not expect much further from this title but surprisingly enough smith <UNK> james and managed to reach a theatrical performance which could be <UNK> <UNK> on their rap dance floor routine by the end of the film their characters formed an effective <UNK> which may <UNK> more than a good laugh with this sunday afternoon dvd providing your date is not an exquisite french swedish directors of the 60's movie fan br br p s the techniques to score are all true especially the cocktail girl routine
<START> whenever an idea was successful during those golden days of the silent movies you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated although <UNK> is the term that is used of course one could make the argument that this <UNK> business has never left us for success in the movies or tv always leads to a trend with all competing parties <UNK> to come up with their own version of said hit movie or tv program br br to this last premise we strongly disagree for this is or <UNK> plain and simple br br this the last silent laurel hardy short surely must have been quite well received for <UNK> love hal roach mgm <UNK> was <UNK> on the roach lot not once but twice over the next three years we were treated to laughing <UNK> roach mgm 1931 in which the goat was replaced with a cute little puppy dog also the weather is transformed into the dead of winter in the middle of a <UNK> they also made other line up changes with <UNK> <UNK> edgar kennedy with <UNK> charlie hall br br the second <UNK> of the hidden animal premise is the 3 <UNK> the <UNK> roach mgm 1932 which <UNK> a female ape from a <UNK> and <UNK> circus to which stan and babe were former employees the circus paid off its employees with their <UNK> and the boys received the <UNK> as their final <UNK> br br back to our original <UNK> today's subject <UNK> love the short starts off simply enough the boys encounter the goat on the street and the <UNK> in return follows them back to their <UNK> house after stan <UNK> a <UNK> to her the comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between l h and slow burn <UNK> edgar kennedy their <UNK> the impact is <UNK> by having the interplay occur at night and as luck would have it their room is <UNK> directly above the <UNK> quarters br br in addition to the noise the bathing of the goat its <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about laurel <UNK> having another person <UNK> in the room we were most amused by a little throw away gag which may well have been missed by the censors while <UNK> the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any <UNK> person's being in there overnight regardless of their sex br br its camera shot is made from inside the boy's room over their shoulder with edgar in the hall and facing them he warns remember this is a respectable establishment just as he says this a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the <UNK> followed by a <UNK> sailor who <UNK> his hat forward as they pass <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is at times a wild 80s college sex comedy others a sweet romantic one then it has moments of serious drama and then <UNK> in <UNK> of science fiction it is so uneven its almost ridiculous br br but i would hardly rank it as one of the worst films i've ever seen except of course for the fact that they casted peter o'toole br br there is absolutely nothing for him to work with here poor dialog poor performances to work off of poor everything and yet he's fantastic there is not one good thing about his part and yet he makes it work if only on pure charm alone br br the fact that he was so able to achieve so much with so little shines a spotlight on how greatly everyone else in this film failed making it seem even worse than i suppose it actually is br br if any other actor was in <UNK> role i would have forgotten this movie as crap and never thought of it again but a fine performance by peter o'toole despite all odds <UNK> that i'll remember this film for a long time to come if only as a film that maybe could have been good if anyone involved in it was nearly half as good as peter o'toole
<START> by 1971 it was becoming more and more obvious that hammer film studios were on the way out hands of the <UNK> is a case in point where even the idea <UNK> of desperation the spirit of jack the <UNK> <UNK> his own daughter yeah okay no one was expecting a documentary but this plot seems to be <UNK> the bottom of the barrel for stupid premise and you do find yourself questioning why on earth the producers brought jack the <UNK> into the story was this to give the movie a snappy title br br the production values are unimpressive and the cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap <UNK> feel but you know you're not going to be watching a classic hammer horror as soon as the title starts because the music is laughably inappropriate i think the composer was trying to make the theme tune haunting and touching but the music resembles something out of a <UNK> romantic movie i will give the cast some credit as they do take their roles seriously in what's a far from serious movie br br i didn't enjoy this film much and it instantly reminded me of the phantom <UNK> <UNK> of london town from the two <UNK> which i'd been laughing at in the weeks before i saw this
<START> true love i truly enjoyed and loved this movie it was fun funny and inspirational i just saw it on dvd how did i miss this one it's a winner i mean <UNK> was that guy i wanted to marry him this was my 1st time seeing him as a straight leading man and he pulls it off i thought miller was the best ever and i was a <UNK> head too a <UNK> woman who only fears her <UNK> thank you for giving women of color range in your work and she looks great <UNK> smith was a blast wright was priceless as <UNK> this cute romantic comedy is a must see oh and the new <UNK> marcus patrick is worth the surprise ladies true love karen
<START> camp blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film we're mixing friday the 13th with the blair witch project and adding a killer in a clown mask br br the budget for this film must have been very low some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the <UNK> version of the original night of the living dead which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor br br this film was just so bad there is nothing in the film even worth watching the very fact i watched this all the way through stunned me just take my advice and don't buy or rent this film it is appalling
<START> roy rogers as roy and sidekick raymond <UNK> as rusty join teddy <UNK> rough riders soon they get suspended in order to round up the killer of partner eddie as tommy along the mexican u s border they discover creepy gold <UNK> in the process notice how even suspended mr rogers is able to get the rough riders to join in his round up br br this is not one of the better roy rogers westerns the fighting scenes look like choreographed dances rogers sings down the trail one of two relatively ordinary songs and a stand out moment overall br br rough round up 3 13 <UNK> joseph kane roy rogers raymond <UNK> <UNK> roberts
<START> this movie fully deserves to be one of the top hindi comedies ever made <UNK> <UNK> is mostly known for his gritty hard hitting social dramas but this is easily the most <UNK> movie he has made br br the plot revolves around two small town <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> khan and <UNK> salman khan they want to get rich quick and so move to the big city they <UNK> the same plan <UNK> to woo a rich <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is the daughter of a rich businessman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> thus the one who marries <UNK> gets his hands on all her wealth but when they get to know each other's plan there is an intense <UNK> of one over who marries <UNK> hilarious gags and situations ensue as the battle <UNK> on br br at the same time <UNK> identical twin brother wants to eliminate his brother and niece and <UNK> the family fortune add to this an assortment of funny characters including a maid <UNK> <UNK> kapoor a mistake prone butler named robert a manager named khan who <UNK> villain and a funny gangster <UNK> <UNK> kapoor who looks more like a pirate and a <UNK> comedy <UNK> you br br do not waste your time looking for logic in the movie leave the company of your brains and just enjoy the actors are so much in sync with the script that no room is left for mistakes dialogues <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are witty music <UNK> and lyrics are memorable the <UNK> and choreography khan of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lo <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is fitting and will remain <UNK> in my mind forever br br the film starred two <UNK> in the making <UNK> khan and salman khan they eventually became <UNK> <UNK> khan is impeccable in his first all out comedy role i <UNK> his sense of comic timing salman <UNK> in comparison with <UNK> but is still likable among the supporting characters <UNK> <UNK> stands out in his <UNK> role of <UNK> and br br the movie surprisingly failed at the box office i fail to understand why i recommend it to all nevertheless
<START> why would i say that because when the movie ended i was in a good mood so many people <UNK> at the end wow bruce willis can be funny for those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense you must be very new to his career he won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did die hard it's like saying wow the sky learned to <UNK> snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life the movie was hilarious what <UNK> my mind is how some other comments made about this movie claims that there are no memorable lines or scenes spoiler br br the i am not a loser have you ever seen a grown up scream i am not a loser before br br i thought this movie was great it was funny it was never boring and in a cheesy disney sort of way it had a point to make something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in over it's head but for once i didn't care br br if you haven't watched it do so you'll like it
<START> this film makes clooney all his films combined before this have all been based on the same character this film he <UNK> his previous body of work and proves his <UNK> as a top notch actor the soundtrack <UNK> most one <UNK> the brothers have truly made a classic one to own and watch repeatedly
<START> i have never seen this movie on its own but like many others who have already commented i saw it as an episode of mst3k really terrible 70s television schlock but someone saw its potential because it's just been turned into a <UNK> million flop called the island br br and to the person who asked whether there were any good movies made in the 70s i want to remind her that it was a golden age for american film with directors like robert altman and martin <UNK> first coming into their own not to mention little things like star wars 1977 just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far
<START> all the actors in this film seem bored they are not really interested in their roles and the dialogue is all delivered in <UNK> it's a problem because i think the basic idea for the film is really very sound i suppose it's just bad direction which leaves the actors <UNK>
<START> i'd liked the takashi miike films i'd seen so far but i found this pretty disappointing i'd bought it but i won't be keeping it br br i saw it on the dvd which has just two episodes in the first a killer <UNK> women cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain plants them in the ground up to their <UNK> and plants a flower in the brain you can tell that from the dvd box in the movie the top of the head is <UNK> <UNK> out by tv static had you not seen the dvd box the viewer wouldn't know what people were looking at until later a young cop produced a small model of the body oddly there is also a flash frame later on of the woman's head and it is not <UNK> apart from this i'm not really sure what was going on some women get phone calls and a <UNK> animated character around when that happens an animated character also appears on tv screens sometimes it's unclear if anybody sees it br br in the second episode pregnant women are being found cut open and their babies are missing again a cop produces a model of what the corpses are like which is helpful since again the actual body is <UNK> there is also a natural birth in the movie but oddly even that baby and the <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> according the the dvd box <UNK> versions were not kept when this was originally made perhaps even if they had if they knew they were going to be <UNK> maybe they didn't bother actually showing anything not sure br br if i hear the later episodes are better maybe i'll look for them as it is i won't bother
<START> i really liked this film it features john wayne in his first starring performance even then you can tell wayne has a real presence although he wouldn't really mature into the icon he is known for until <UNK> 9 years later in 1939 it's about <UNK> from all over the country heading to the new west to <UNK> it wayne's character <UNK> coleman joins up but for his own personal reasons most of the main actors were stage actors and had never done a film before which makes the movie even more amazing they managed to create believable distinctive characters and there is quite an oddball mix here <UNK> would come out a year later and had a very similar story though i didn't like it as much as this movie for me the big trail is a strong 8 10
<START> a cheap and <UNK> heist movie with poor characterisation lots of style stoic <UNK> think <UNK> <UNK> fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying <UNK> rolls a la john woo even the <UNK> look awful at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america three <UNK> old cars do not a country make the <UNK> even has a <UNK> right front wheel the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing it couldn't come soon enough even the <UNK> from the robbery looks like the <UNK> junk costume <UNK> available the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time worth watching if you want to know how not to make a cliché ridden low budget movie
<START> the box is a film with great potential but the makers totally <UNK> that potential the film seemed to take for ever because of the boring family <UNK> and scenes about school and job dialogs between the action those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the <UNK> and thrill the philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of thomas but we find ourselves <UNK> struck with magic and <UNK> were even harry potter would <UNK> his class with br br probably the best part was that moment when norma lewis cameron diaz has been shot to death by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will i wonder how would react if he could
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has made 3 great movies boys meet girls sang les <UNK> du <UNK> in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth the beauty of juvenile wilderness <UNK> in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about about all he have seen but using it and melting it into his times x is a very different movie because <UNK> made les <UNK> du <UNK> a of 20 millions dollars a film that has destroyed everything on its way after such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view so <UNK> <UNK> has to changed and he did the movie isn't as beautiful as its first it's more reasonable no more studio no more <UNK> paris <UNK> has entered at last reality it's not clean anymore it's not poetic characters <UNK> have become a romantic in the german sense of it
<START> miranda <UNK> is known for her debut in school of rock with jack black and her role as <UNK> in the show drake and josh and she has become a fan favorite amongst the <UNK> public so it isn't a surprise that dan schneider would create a show just for her unfortunately it ends up being as bad as if not worse than the amanda show br br is about three friends <UNK> sam and <UNK> who have become <UNK> in the junior high community through a <UNK> show called <UNK> and sam are the <UNK> and <UNK> shoots and puts it up on the internet <UNK> also has an older brother named spencer acted by the hilarious jerry <UNK> who is known for his work in drake and josh as crazy steve br br well let me tell you this don't believe the 8 3 out of 10 this show received because it is pathetic in nearly every aspect dan schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all i see is him saying <UNK> <UNK> teenagers love anything beginning with <UNK> and a majority of <UNK> that were used in drake and josh if not then they are just really dry and forced jokes that don't even count on a chuckle such as you want me to turn up the <UNK> to 60 degrees no we want you to turn it up to 60 <UNK> not only that but if you look closely nearly all the sets in the shows were used in drake and josh and <UNK> <UNK> that were simply spit and polished with random stuff to try and make it look different br br the scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the network is just as terrible as the entire series itself the dialogue in them is <UNK> bad which may be accepted by some since it is just two friends playing around in front of a camera but what's the deal with the really odd <UNK> antics they do like random dancing and it just gets worse from there br br in terms of acting miranda and aren't at their best by far nathan who played <UNK> isn't believable at times but he does an okay job the person who really steals the show is the humorous <UNK> of jerry <UNK> who fits in his protective older brother role very well and his wide eyed loud mouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments too bad they aren't frequent because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinion br br dan schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving miranda <UNK> her own cable born <UNK> to hop around and <UNK> unfunny jokes and pathetic cue card lines in every direction because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorly done script and <UNK> acting dan schneider did a great job with drake and josh so it's a real disappointment that is such a failure jerry acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating but he alone can't save from being as horrible as it is
<START> the outer limits is a brilliant show that for the most part leaves me with very strong emotions there are undoubtedly some stinker episodes but it's essentially an old pulp comic turned into a tv show so that can be expected for the most part it's excellently done well produced and directed and often featuring some big name talent who seem to enjoy working in a solid translation of short fiction to hour long television format br br the outer limits tends to focus on rather large <UNK> philosophical moral questions and rarely ends without the voice over serious thought br br from time to time the themes are <UNK> in a little bit too heavily for all but the most thick headed viewers additionally while a certain level of <UNK> of the government is <UNK> to an effective democracy you can <UNK> catch several episodes back to back that border on the absurd with regards to <UNK> of the army cia etc one further note is that any large group with power the roman catholic church the people's republic of china and so on are cast in a bad light in <UNK> ranging from once to often br br while the show can beat a dead horse if it's watched enough the overall quality is astounding and i'm grateful that sci fi has decided to continue airing it until they produce a season by season dvd set and i can afford it
<START> the other day i showed my boyfriend a great movie stand by me a movie i have shown to many people and they absolutely <UNK> it but for some odd reason he didn't like it he lends me a movie called and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it instead i hated this movie i don't think i've hated a movie so much in a while how this movie has even a 6 6 rating is beyond me i couldn't keep up with the five million stories here billy baldwin becoming a fire man the random sibling rivalry the random love story s the who's being an <UNK> story the investigator the fire who has a personality of it's own i just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting i would have just preferred if this movie was about being a <UNK> or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why br br the movie tells the story of a group of chicago <UNK> two brothers stephen bull <UNK> the elder brother is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights brian the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before then <UNK> on a number of other <UNK> careers before returning to become a <UNK> he is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter donald shadow is an <UNK> investigator who is dedicated to his profession he is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections martin is an on the city <UNK> he has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department many of the rank and file <UNK> believe that the cuts that he has made are <UNK> the lives of the <UNK> however is initially successful in portraying the fire department as <UNK> and <UNK> after <UNK> are repeatedly being killed in <UNK> br br i just couldn't get into this movie i don't know how anyone else could it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed <UNK> all wrong i loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick i just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles donald sutherland great actor but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time i know ron was going for great quality but i think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film i even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably kevin spacey the fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there i didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people i'll stick to the <UNK> in my relationship from this point on br br 2 10
<START> the <UNK> strike again i had no going in and i was amazed at the bizarre telling of a good bad guy story although clooney is easily in this his <UNK> style is welcome <UNK> and nelson are dead and i loved i am a man of constant sorrow as performed by the <UNK> bottom boys catchy tune br br 8 of 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boot air force one gives us an exciting film where the <UNK> go to the supporting actor john <UNK> his criminal attempting to <UNK> the president was first rate and credible br br that is not to <UNK> the efforts of clint eastwood and <UNK> russo or even fred dalton thompson who plays a real jerk of a white house chief of staff eastwood was great and i love any film that russo is in br br the movie feature original music by five time oscar winner <UNK> the <UNK> the mission days of heaven <UNK> <UNK> that alone makes it worth your time
<START> i give this movie 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot line without going into too much detail br br the acting in this movie is terrible really terrible wooden shallow br br the <UNK> on show is weak so bloody weak that i can only wonder why they bothered to use <UNK> artists at all it was obvious in the <UNK> scenes that they'd gotten other people in to do the <UNK> they might as well have let the actors do the painting and saved themselves a few cents br br i would avoid this film at all costs br br the kid <UNK> soundtrack used to be something i listened to on my <UNK> its going to be a while before i can go back there for fear of this movie coming back into my mind br br avoid at all costs unless you are thinking to yourself wow its been a while since i've seen a really sh t movie
<START> this attempt at a thriller would have no substance at all some may state that this movie has it all <UNK> <UNK> robbery lost love a bag of money cut throats murder blood a <UNK> <UNK> revolver <UNK> teeth <UNK> boobs various <UNK> can be used large <UNK> <UNK> people a brother duo attempting to out portray dumb and dumber white wolves fight scenes that resemble happy <UNK> snow mobile s a large <UNK> vehicle and a motel under <UNK> all this with an melody toward the end br br perhaps my rating is a bit harsh but one viewing will certainly be enough for the sane with nothing else to do br br
<START> ok we got <UNK> from <UNK> boy and chuck from well chuck i thought this movie would be quite good based on the reviews and it did start out pretty high on my movie scale but about halfway through it was just dragging out for so long i kept losing interest i actually got so bored probably because you can see right away what's going to happen in the end the story is actually quite thread bare i <UNK> over 15 minutes and didn't miss a thing this film should have been a short work maybe around 45 minutes to an hour max it starts out good and finishes good too bad the filling is bland boring dull and lacks everything but time some people say they like it for the music i don't care for jazz and i don't go see movies for their score i go for the story and when that's drawn out well ratings drop in my book br br bottom line good open great close boring filler story was cool but if you don't know what's going to happen a quarter of the way through you haven't seen too many thrillers
<START> i was on a british <UNK> flight from london to new york when i saw this movie i wish i could have fallen asleep the story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did br br gary played by andy garcia was such an unlikable character that i found it hard to be supportive of him <UNK> acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie br br <UNK> <UNK> did a fine job with her portrayal of linda <UNK> romantic interest i can not say anything bad about <UNK> i always enjoy her acting the problem here is that the romance between andy and <UNK> is so far fetched and unbelievable the two do not make a good pair on the big screen br br the end of the movie was almost as much of a let down as the movie itself a nod from the <UNK> and all is forgiven come on the event that allows this movie to have a some what happy ending and that the writers would expect us to accept it is pathetic gary does not change and only by the death of a dear friend does his situation get better br br there are tons of great movies that should be seen before this one don't waste your time br br
<START> the film is set in <UNK> on <UNK> in north east england the town where i was born and grew up the film is also <UNK> <UNK> the way it presents the town the kids but above all the men of the town in this film they are all stupid violent <UNK> thugs br br i suppose i could comment on the plot predictable the performances competently unattractive the direction lazy and unimaginative but to me that is all irrelevant compared to the director's insult to the town and its people br br thus the <UNK> in my summary to the director and writer mark herman to leave the north east
<START> i truly was disappointed by this film which i had high hopes for it seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time including <UNK> own lady which featured two of the same stars and the success of william powell and myrna loy three years into their pairing they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great <UNK> to the previous year's lady and the two thin man movies they had done prior to this double wedding tells the story of a clothing store <UNK> myrna loy who is intent on <UNK> the life of her sister <UNK> rice future brother in law john <UNK> and her own servants which include sidney <UNK> and mary gordon when the independent spirited william powell comes into her life having distracted rice and <UNK> from <UNK> constant control loy meets her match sounds good so far right yeah an interesting premise falls short sad to say because <UNK> character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see powell fall in love with her which we know will soon happen it's another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading something hollywood did often during its golden age when loy says she doesn't have time to both run her business and have a man in her life its a <UNK> br br fortunately other than powell there is free spirited jessie ralph on board a <UNK> wealthy older woman who helped loy start her business she has an <UNK> with powell and can see immediately through <UNK> cool claims that she <UNK> him rice and <UNK> are a boring couple and the whole premise of powell getting between them is senseless then an ex wife of <UNK> shows up which really isn't necessary at that late point in the story and the final wedding scene where a crowd of people try to get into <UNK> tiny trailer is a weak attempt to bring some farce it is funny though that powell keeps getting hit by items meant by loy to hit edgar kennedy with those chuckles are most welcome since there are so few others powell and loy would do better in two later screwball comedies i love you again and love crazy which are sophisticated witty and fun this film attempts to be all three but ends up a sophisticated bore

<START> take the secret agent james bond <UNK> of the sixties mix in some concepts from <UNK> <UNK> female fu <UNK> femme fatale and stir in some twisted <UNK> by director franco you have the man hating lesbian or the 7 secrets of better known as the girl from <UNK> in the usa <UNK> that man from <UNK> which has nothing to do with this yes this does take place in brazil we must give it that or <UNK> as she's also referred to is like an evil version of modesty blaise played here by actress <UNK> with that familiar <UNK> smile which most of us first became <UNK> with in <UNK> there are numerous close up shots of her staring off camera slowly opening her mouth probably while watching something unpleasant however she is <UNK> in her key lesbian scene she controls an entire army of female warriors <UNK> <UNK> and rules a city called or something just outside <UNK> de <UNK> these concepts which previously appeared in the million eyes of sound terrific but despite some intriguing set design visuals it follows the same campy atmosphere of for example the very dated some girls do which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army at first glance the sight of all these armed females usually <UNK> up in a row catches one's interest but after 15 minutes or so you realize there's nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual br br the plot follows what seems like a secret agent a male arriving in brazil with 10 million dollars he catches the attention of the local crime lord sanders <UNK> it up as an elderly bond type villain who sends dark suited thugs in <UNK> hats to <UNK> him this sets everything up for a 3 way conflict between the agent the crime lord and the mysterious the crime lord wants secrets also keeps various prisoners in glass <UNK> maybe that's one of the secrets this sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace there are many shots which could have used a lot of <UNK> one shot of an arriving airplane for example stays on the craft as it <UNK> to a near stop as if this had never been captured on film before there's a similar approach to a typical sunset as if there's something unusual about it the fight scenes are very <UNK> as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes to add some production value there's a scene of the real <UNK> carnival about <UNK> through i'm guessing there were various budget problems especially evident in the climactic battle where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action such as the lack of even real looking guns it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired falling over <UNK> there are touches of <UNK> such as torturing a character to get answers and female nudity an early depiction of such after some <UNK> were lifted but mostly you'll be rolling your eyes hero 3 villains 5 femme <UNK> 5 henchmen 4 fights 3 stunts chases 3 <UNK> 4 auto 4 locations 6 pace 3 overall 4

<START> being a harrison ford fan i am probably being kind it was predictable sappy my husband made a lot of <UNK> sounds while we were watching it what a disappointing movie our local newspaper san jose <UNK> news actually gave this 4 stars out of 4 stars hard to believe that the reviewer saw the same movie we did
<START> five fingers of death although previous shaw martial arts epics had shown the influence of the american cowboy genre none had paid such open tribute to it as this one especially in the saloon fight scene and though shaw bros films had borrowed from the japanese <UNK> <UNK> genre before none had done so with such success as this one i suppose some of this had to do with the fact that the director <UNK> from korea and thus brought a non chinese perspective to such <UNK> which certainly raises some interesting questions about culture but in any event this film presented real <UNK> in technology and technique in hong kong action films for the first time in hong kong the camera was given access to the whole of any given set which meant shots from many different angles such as the low angle interior shot showing the ceiling of a room the original american <UNK> of which usually credited to john ford or the high angle long shot that allowed <UNK> of a large ground area or the frontal tracking shot br br it is true that this was not the first hand to hand combat film of real cinematic substance that remains wang <UNK> <UNK> but on a commercial level shaw bros were right to choose <UNK> as their first major release to the west because one might say it was the of their action films that is the least <UNK> on purely chinese theater traditions although this made no impression on the american critics at the time who universally <UNK> the picture it wasn't lost on american audiences especially among african americans whose culture had always been by necessity an <UNK> <UNK> of borrowed elements and <UNK> in <UNK> they were given the opportunity to discover the core of the story in the earnest young man forced to make the extra effort to overcome social <UNK> and betrayal in order to have his merit recognized this seems to be an issue universal to <UNK> but each culture has its own way of expressing and <UNK> it <UNK> presented it in a way many americans could relate to as well as chinese br br so is the film now only of historical value certainly not for one thing this issue hasn't gone away secondly some of the <UNK> leave much of the film looking as fresh today as it did on first release also the action is well staged and the performances though a little too earnest are crisp the film is a might over long but the story does cover a lot of ground and there are marvelous set pieces through out such as the saloon confrontation the fight on the road to the contest the odd double finale br br definitely looks better on a theater screen but still impressive for home viewing recommended
<START> if you're a fan of the original series do not see this movie br br i should have been skeptical from the previews when <UNK> expresses her motives for murder in the series <UNK> had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests obviously the <UNK> writer in charge felt the movie needed to <UNK> to the bad <UNK> by making the character deadly but have a good reason to kill people br br you wouldn't have thought it possible but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon the characters are all portrayed as <UNK> good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved all dogs go to heaven and same for every character that dies in this movie br br the selfish twisted perverted <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> are nowhere to be seen in the end they literally develop into a <UNK> couple ala annie hall the only character who remained true to the show was the the floating machine in the sky i suppose if you ever thought gee i like <UNK> <UNK> but i wish it were more like every other <UNK> good v evil sci fi hollywood <UNK> out there then you are in for a treat br br they didn't even get the look right i suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for but the whole setting is wrong 400 years into the future sure looks like 30 years into the past instead of a distinctly urban post apocalyptic world the viewer's eyes are offended with a 70's <UNK> squad of egg shaped furniture wood <UNK> walls earth tones and lots of plants was a <UNK> not a <UNK> br br speaking of that's the only city on earth according to the movie the show is clear that there are two cities and monica which used to be one in the movie the are just hollywood <UNK> freedom fighters they also have as much technology as the which is not the case from the show br br the only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid and that he wrote it the day before it was due to the studio <UNK> and he's never seen an entire <UNK> <UNK> all the way through the overwhelming amount of <UNK> with the cartoon is <UNK> beyond using certain names like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the movie is nothing like the show br br the actual bulk of the movie seems to try to blend the colorful plots of <UNK> <UNK> green blade runner <UNK> run and tomb <UNK> which came out a dull brown mess
<START> i've seen this movie twice on international film festival <UNK> the movie is in competition and i really hope that <UNK> will get one of the awards at least the best image award br br as a silent cinema fan i'm interested in contemporary movies that quote or recreate the language of the <UNK> year cinema the previous reviewer <UNK> the quotes from fritz lang and <UNK> w <UNK> as i see it the movie references directly <UNK> metropolis and the <UNK> character of his plots but i didn't see <UNK> in it there's a more obvious <UNK> homage though the moon with a here <UNK> smoking human face and the paper made painted mountains and city landscapes i enjoyed the film mostly for its visuals and in the meantime i found very interesting the story on and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the <UNK> city from this perspective this movie is an unique <UNK> on the of the silent cinema because in the films of the silent period one can hardly find stories with mute characters in this case can be <UNK> whether the story on the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form or there's an intention to play upon the of the silent films another example of this kind of <UNK> i found in guy <UNK> careful where the inhabitants of a mountain village have <UNK> in using their voices i intend to write a paper on it if you know movies related to this topic please let me know br br i highly recommend <UNK> film to every <UNK> one of the critics called it the jewel of the festival br br ps winners were announced and the film won the award for best cinematography
<START> an <UNK> <UNK> episode the explores the aftermath of the tragic events that <UNK> the <UNK> in the previous one as the main characters john locke <UNK> kate and <UNK> come to terms with the incident in the <UNK> locke and <UNK> set out to find out where henry took off to as it turns out <UNK> is on a mission of his own trying to figure out the symbol which locke had drawn on his sketch we see flashes of life in sydney as a priest who comes in contact with his brother through a stranger we also witness the tragedy that struck the <UNK> <UNK> down to a room <UNK> as michael continues to remain a mystery br br an excellent lost episode with many interesting turns
<START> i haven't seen this fine movie in 50 years but i'm entering a comment on it anyway br br while jack <UNK> movie was no doubt intended purely as an entertainment showing marine basic training at <UNK> island in realistic terms as a tough character building exercise it was said the military was afraid the movie would <UNK> it did not work out that way the movie showed that entering the marines was a greater challenge than most young people ever realized and guess what being offered a king sized challenge was exactly what many guys wanted i personally knew lots of guys that joined the marines shortly after seeing the <UNK> lines at <UNK> centers were suddenly so long the marines had more <UNK> than they could handle br br so it goes america will always have youth seeking to make themselves into the best while the <UNK> and born losers limp along to nowhere br br what we don't have in 2007 is any films that inspire <UNK> devotion to duty of any kind positive values et <UNK> what we do have is films that inspire the <UNK> ed to be <UNK> the beer <UNK> to beer other negative values exhibit 1 is that the <UNK> teen travesty and beer <UNK> epic <UNK> is now <UNK> in the all time great films list values mean values
<START> as i sit here i find myself laughing at certain moments in this film go and see this film br br if you've ever been <UNK> go and see this film br br if you've ever wanted to go <UNK> go and see this film br br my bet is that the film was <UNK> from an idea whilst out <UNK> and this is the product of that one in a million chance that someone remembered it in the morning and had the <UNK> to follow it through br br in summary then go and see this film br br
<START> movies like this give independent films a bad name this simply a boring <UNK> of with no structure whatsoever i wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned if you want to see a good <UNK> comedy watch half baked it's no award winner but at least it made me laugh the film was obviously made on a <UNK> budget every scene either takes place in someone's house someone's apartment or some <UNK> location if the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting i would've ignored the film's budget like in the case of edward <UNK> films but obviously that's not the case this time around br br i quote robert deniro from a <UNK> tale when i say there's nothing in the world worse than wasted talent everybody in the cast is talented luke wilson alicia <UNK> <UNK> murphy jeremy <UNK> all talented performers and they all have been in much better movies the actors give it their all but they couldn't go too far with such a lame script the only scene i found interesting was jack <UNK> cameo where he sings a song about being in the woods and of course there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning which i also found appealing br br the characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists many movies are awful but at least you understand their intentions what was intention the world will never know br br my score 2 out of 10
<START> when dirty dancing was on tv in the middle of last year i was out so i didn't get to see it my mum <UNK> that i had seen it and that she had it on tape somewhere anyway getting to the point she couldn't find her video so for christmas i bought her the dvd well she hasn't had a look in it sat around for a while then one night i decided to take it upstairs to watch and i fell in love with it this is a great film with lots of lovely scenes i love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it it's definitely not for everyone but if you love a love story then you will want to watch dirty dancing again and again dirty dancing the way love is meant to be
<START> usually i do not like movies with about aliens but k <UNK> is different the actors are great in the movie especially kevin spacey played his character breathtaking the movie never fall to a lower level the suspense is always in the movie and you absolutely wanna know how it ends what's about you have to think a lot after the movie over the movie because there are a few open questions is robert porter or is only using robert <UNK> body as a means of <UNK> how can he see <UNK> light and how can he know that much about but everybody can make his own end and can decide in what he wanna believe very good movie with an excellent kevin spacey
<START> late film critic gene <UNK> said that this movie shows how easy it is to make a movie he was giving it a compliment even though now that might have been taken as an insult these days even though i didn't always agree with gene <UNK> i agree with him here love jones is a shining example of how a love story should be realistic with real characters in real situations br br the story chronicles the ups and downs of the relationship between darius <UNK> <UNK> and nina long <UNK> <UNK> and long are more than just a beautiful couple on screen these two actually have chemistry together you can feel the vibe between these two whenever the are on screen and its fantastic br br bill <UNK> is pretty funny as the <UNK> wood and lisa nicole carson is great as <UNK> friend <UNK> <UNK> washington is just as great as close friend and i sigh every time i see him in a movie the guy is a great actor whose career is ruined by industry <UNK> and the childish games they play you can believe that he called the little <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> out of his name but anybody that knows how <UNK> works knows better than to believe any official story from the place of make believe at any rate br br love jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and likable characters that are in realistic situations that anybody that has been in love can relate too you love these people because they are believable and are not portrayed as gangsters and <UNK> not one obscene stereotype can be found here contrast that with the romance movies of <UNK> exactly in closing if you love black cinema then you would do well to own a copy of this movie
<START> reasonably effective horror science fiction a la alien is fairly well done given its limited ambitions some nice special effects and well paced action sequences adequately <UNK> the cracks in the rather tiresome dialogue when a space craft crash lands on a remote planet the survivors soon become aware that a hideous terror <UNK> them in the dark of the upcoming total <UNK>
<START> i love ghost stories and i will sit through a movie <UNK> it's end even if i'm not really enjoying it i rarely feel like i wasted my time but this adaptation of the bell witch story was horrible br br it wasn't scary in the least bit what is with the comic relief moments the dialog was tedious acting inconsistent the movie was way too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open like the birthday party br br the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done br br i am curious about other adaptation but until then i will stick to reading about the story
<START> this really is a film of two <UNK> the first <UNK> the lives and friendship of two boys one a <UNK> and the other a down <UNK> in late 70s afghanistan before the invasion by the <UNK> works extremely well the young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief br br the real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the as a man living in america ancient <UNK> to his young friend lead him to return to his <UNK> and it is really at this point that things break down the central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic but in fact comes across as <UNK> and <UNK> in self pity it is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see that of his <UNK> friend br br once he returns to afghanistan the narrative becomes <UNK> down in a series of highly contrived <UNK> most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately even though he is not looking for him despite the chaos that has since consumed the country this <UNK> him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible the resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful <UNK> sentimentality which <UNK> any really serious points the film may be trying to make br br although it is possible to start seeing characters and the <UNK> of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which <UNK> with any wider political discussion instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character's emotional journey of self discovery and healing unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story while opportunities to make a really interesting film about afghanistan itself are wasted
<START> this is a delightful gem of a movie unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> as just for kids the plot revolves around a young man roy <UNK> newly arrived in <UNK> florida from the montana mountains trying to fit in with the other kids at his middle school roy discovers a brother sister team trying to protect <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at an illegal construction site look for carl the author of the book upon which this movie is based as the male secretary to the evil boss at corporate <UNK> writer director <UNK> is also the clerk at the public records office where the <UNK> teen detectives discover that the <UNK> <UNK> impact report is missing luke wilson nearly steals all the crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who have most of the best lines wilson is the bumbling police officer in his three <UNK> electric police <UNK> complete with blue light and funky <UNK> as officer dave he tries so hard to do well but usually ends up falling in the <UNK> literally several times jimmy <UNK> is pretty low key as the <UNK> supportive science teacher but young actors logan <UNK> roy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the bear and cody <UNK> fingers are superb as the teens who finally put officer dave on the right track following the paper trail left by the evil corporate boss i hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as i did just plain fun one small complaint though i hope all non realize that not everyone from florida is as <UNK> to <UNK> as depicted in this film we're really a friendly bunch just ask carl and jimmy <UNK>
<START> i was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when i found it to be complete and utter rubbish direction is both heavy handed and cliched how much more cliched can you get than paris at night the male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their to <UNK> angst ridden self <UNK> yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually <UNK> what is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish the only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good <UNK> and <UNK> really are
<START> there are plenty of reviews that describe this movie as the worst ever made for sure there are plenty of mistakes lackluster acting rather boring and cliched and at times <UNK> script and the stock b movie sound and special effects as noted there are plenty of <UNK> of plot making cave <UNK> a <UNK> of fantasy film especially in comparison with the lord of the rings trilogy however this movie is not the worst movie ever most if not all including this review of these reviews are written by fans of <UNK> therefore many of these reviews are pretty much <UNK> of the <UNK> episode of cave <UNK> br br in the episode joel tom <UNK> and crow remark to the mad scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them of course loyal fans have taken this quote and ran with it i have found this movie endearing not in a way that one finds forrest <UNK> endearing but in the effort put into this movie by some the cast also this movie is laughable without its <UNK> treatment that is because cave <UNK> does not take itself seriously and it is not trying to <UNK> into its viewers some sort of righteous theme for all of the monster puppets medieval hang <UNK> and continuity <UNK> this movie does not <UNK> to be any more that what it is a shallow depiction of a rather shallow genre br br likewise i can't bring myself to hate miles <UNK> or lisa foster instead this hatred is for coleman francis tony jennifer lopez arch hall jr and so on br br
<START> h g had difficulties working in france after he had made le in 1943 which was produced by the german company and later judged by french as a piece of anti french propaganda louis <UNK> an admirer of <UNK> work invited him to direct a thriller <UNK> des where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder that happened in paris music hall without each other knowledge the seductive <UNK> singer jenny <UNK> <UNK> and her jealous piano husband maurice who is <UNK> in love with her <UNK> <UNK> father of director <UNK> <UNK> trying to cover up without each other's knowledge what they believe to be their involvement in the murder enters <UNK> policeman louis <UNK> who is determined to discover the truth <UNK> practically stole the movie with wonderfully <UNK> and sentimental in the same time performance his character his eagle like profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable <UNK> des witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses was a great comeback of h g the fine director french hitchcock
<START> despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this <UNK> stuart <UNK> better than <UNK> attempt all the major players from the series were present <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a half dozen more albeit most of them in cameo <UNK> <UNK> and were the main players and jesse of the also despite other reviews i think this movie and the music was faithful to anne <UNK> portrayal and <UNK> at least as i perceive it was pretty good as in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene the movie didn't capture the <UNK> of the books series but i thought it was a nice <UNK> br br i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne <UNK> style <UNK> and <UNK> and i found this movie a faithful and often <UNK> representation of the author's vision
<START> don't see this movie it's repulsive the start is indeed very good but in the middle everything falls and i really regret spending 80 about 11 dollars on the ticket peter <UNK> should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest awful picture the only bright spot is the splendid work of robert lena <UNK> and br br hope you take my advise the picture is rubbish
<START> this is high <UNK> soft porn a boring soap opera <UNK> on one thing sex they actually made sex boring sad to say because i defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was what this is is an excuse for kim <UNK> to show off her great body and for mickey rourke to <UNK> a lot that's it <UNK> <UNK> is so bad it's sickening and <UNK> despite the great figure looks cheap more than beautiful br br kudos to the photographer for some nice <UNK> shots and some wonderful color but the story is so weak no character development and no plot it's unable to compensate let's face it this movie was made for only reason to <UNK> male viewers on that level it probably succeeded if i recall it's why i gave it a look being a fan of <UNK> looks but i actually expected a story too br br those trying to pass this off as arty and something deeper than soft porn are only <UNK> themselves
<START> i can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often i've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film i saw it the year it was released i was 19 i don't think there were a dozen people in that east village theater that night for years i thought we were the only ones who saw it nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as i had and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by rent it buy it or steal it a must see
<START> actually there was nothing funny about this monstrosity at all this movie was a complete abomination the <UNK> in this movie almost made me want to vomit i think that the people responsible for this movie took advantage of their viewing audience they took a relatively decent series of movies i did say decent not good and totally <UNK> it by trying to put money in their <UNK> the making of airplane was a way for hollywood to make up for this crappy flick the worst part about it is that either nobody in 1979 realized the <UNK> events of the movie such as door popping off at some <UNK> high <UNK> or <UNK> shooting a flair gun out the window at <UNK> 2 to avoid a nuclear <UNK> what were they thinking were totally unrealistic or they just didn't care i think that it is the latter of the two the writers and director of this film if you want to call it that really tried to suck the airport <UNK> dry with this crap
<START> sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a looney tunes <UNK> than a grisly giallo don't torture a <UNK> 1972 is nonetheless a grade a thriller from horror <UNK> lucio fulci in this one someone has been <UNK> the <UNK> boys in a rural southern italian village and typical for these <UNK> there are many suspects there's barbara <UNK> <UNK> looking more than you've ever seen her a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal <UNK> <UNK> the local <UNK> voodoo woman her witchcraft practicing beau <UNK> the local idiot the sweet faced priest his <UNK> mother and on and on the film features some unusually violent set pieces including a chain <UNK> of one of the main characters in a graveyard one of the most realistically bloody sequences that i've ever seen and a nifty when the killer is ultimately revealed the film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of still this giallo <UNK> with its unusual rural backdrop unsettling child murders oddball characters and freaky score by <UNK> <UNK> the film has been beautifully photographed in what i presume to be <UNK> near the <UNK> in southern italy at least that town's police force is <UNK> in the closing credits and while <UNK> would've made this fine looking dvd work even better the american <UNK> doesn't convince in this rural italian setting anchor bay is to be <UNK> for another job well done oh that title does eventually make perfect sense too
<START> rented this from my local video store it was titled black horizon i guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re release br br micheal <UNK> is not a ninja in this movie one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat another major flaw would be that ice <UNK> action scenes are stolen from other movies particularly the first scene of his rescue which is directly from the wesley snipes movie the art of war with ice t edited in i hope they paid for that footage br br the plot is awful the special effects had little effort put into them love those <UNK> holding them in space the acting is wooden also love those new york russian accents ice t being in the movie is pointless these guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space but i guess they weren't worried about it br br micheal <UNK> should go back to doing what he's good at and make american ninja 6
<START> is there any reason to revive characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked the first time was due to the actors playing them br br who can replace jim carrey or cameron diaz or better yet who can replace them at cut rate <UNK> since most studios know that sequels don't bring in the same amount of <UNK> as the originals so they cut <UNK> from the get go br br where are the good movies going to play if powerful hollywood studios can <UNK> up 3 000 theaters opening weekend with whatever <UNK> they feel like the general public can be <UNK> into br br <UNK> enough people this sequel <UNK> has got to stop and the hollywood people need to start getting their act together or start <UNK> the much better foreign product that's floating in <UNK> br br wake up hollywood cause the people have <UNK> up and they aren't buying it just cause it's new and shiny give us the good stuff and send the rest to the dvd shelves cause we are taking back the theaters once and for all
<START> <UNK> is a pretty white cat who lives with her three <UNK> in her wealthy <UNK> mansion in paris when the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first the butler is <UNK> because he wants to get everything first so he puts them to sleep and <UNK> them off the side of the road when the cats wake up they start on a long trek home a street wise cat named thomas meets up with them and offers to help them when edgar sees them arriving home he is furious and starts to mail them to but <UNK> friends arrive to help save the day the wealthy lady decides to leave her home for every alley cat in paris br br this is a charming film the songs including everybody wants to be a cat are lively and upbeat the voice cast is excellent with eva <UNK> who would later play miss <UNK> in disney's the <UNK> films as <UNK> phil harris <UNK> in the jungle book little john in robin hood as thomas giving interesting personalities to their characters supposedly walt disney before he died in 1966 gave the go ahead to this film recommended for disney fans or cat lovers everywhere 10 10
<START> at last a movie that handles the <UNK> of alien visits with the appropriate depth and loving warmth just in case we're not alone i do believe that these <UNK> are just too to care for us or give that <UNK> bunch of <UNK> goofs a stable proof of their existence we wouldn't <UNK> in the battle <UNK> of some <UNK> desert tribe either unless we're out for messing with our travel insurance huh br br anyway the movie depicts the <UNK> of a weary mind and body by a superior <UNK> that happens quite <UNK> and rather <UNK> but we're dealing with a movie here right so <UNK> is just a trigger to the plot br br jeff bridges acts great as usual but spacey is hilarious the role seems <UNK> downright to him convincing and lovingly mad eating <UNK> sitting in a tree giving his doctor a hard time with <UNK> wisdom and most of all stunning quotes they made me think and <UNK> for hours already br br it's an <UNK> film to say the least and the soundtrack by edward <UNK> is simply beautiful just go and get a copy catch a <UNK> of light now
<START> i guess i should now comment upon a 4th flick in the magnificent seven franchise the sequels still surprise or <UNK> their sleaze and deliberate <UNK> they <UNK> or <UNK> a 4th classic not <UNK> not a sleaze <UNK> <UNK> to the violent vigilante '70s movies absurd trash this installment too is <UNK> awkward and even somewhat strange br br now what i find disturbing that these sequels not only have their <UNK> fans but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the <UNK> style and the br br these sequels are not boring or bizarre they are of course very badly scripts rubbish lines it's straight crazy in this installment each <UNK> gets several van <UNK> young wife begs him to release a young prisoner he finally does the young man <UNK> his life shoots van <UNK> kidnaps the wife rapes and kills joins a van <UNK> who has previously refused to help defending a village now <UNK> a small bunch and charges the <UNK> then the charge the village where van <UNK> has set br br i liked the cast br br van <UNK> is chris <UNK> powers pretty active in the '70s <UNK> westerns is van <UNK> darling <UNK> very is <UNK> a writer and <UNK> sidekick the rest of the aggressive bunch are <UNK> one of the only three survivors <UNK> <UNK> rita rogers is truly hot <UNK> beauty
<START> i cannot understand why this 1971 hollywood production is currently only available through an australian video company but such is the unfortunate obscurity of this peter sellers classic leonard <UNK> movie guide continues to grant it the same bomb review they gave it in the 1970's with so many scene <UNK> on display sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role it all begins with his discovery of a patient who <UNK> at 11 but sellers <UNK> that the corpse is still living due to the fact that the new day doesn't start until <UNK> the final straw for the <UNK> hospital <UNK> comes in that very room the do not <UNK> sign still on the door once he <UNK> the room <UNK> holding his nose there is a brief conversation with the doctor with him doctor we can't save them all that man was at least 85 <UNK> how old was he when he died <UNK> harold <UNK> plays an inept surgeon who <UNK> his eyes when the knife <UNK> in richard <UNK> whose pompous ass reporter in the <UNK> was <UNK> in the rear by john wayne plays the patient who exposes the fraud he only came in for a chest x ray until they discovered he owns a house also in the cast on screen and <UNK> some excellent country <UNK> music is keith allison former <UNK> for paul <UNK> and the <UNK> who also worked with michael on a few <UNK> <UNK> and co wrote <UNK> court with on the birds the <UNK> and the <UNK> alas there is some missing footage from this print including a topless sequence with <UNK> <UNK> near the end also a scene with actress kathleen freeman who wants to use green <UNK> to <UNK> her operation who gets locked by sellers in his office never to be seen again in the uncut version he returns to his office to find that she has written in large letters on the wall unfair <UNK> his response you <UNK> price
<START> there is a complete copy now available at the internet archive watch it or <UNK> it today br br http www archive <UNK> details the <UNK> complete br br one of the greatest animated shorts ever made <UNK> is endlessly inventive and his techniques still <UNK> animation fans 70 years later we may have computer generated techniques now but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that wouldn't take no for an answer whatever he wanted to see on the screen he created br br and he wanted to see some truly bizarre stuff every imaginable piece of <UNK> is called up for service old shoes chicken bones <UNK> broken glasses dolls monkeys rats seems like there was nothing that was off limits br br a truly eerie even unsettling film that should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in animation this film must be seen to be believed
<START> in 1989 here in <UNK> wrestling was somewhat of a mega hype <UNK> and who was <UNK> starship at the <UNK> was the orange <UNK> himself hulk hogan one of my uber heroes at this time so it seems obvious to me now why i <UNK> this movie in 1989 90 when it came out here hulk hogan a k a terry is a shockingly bad actor and <UNK> a k a tiny <UNK> is worse the story line follows a standard wwe then <UNK> circa <UNK> <UNK> story line culminating in the standard good guy beat down hulk up and then get beaten down again story line only to follow that the good guy calls on all his inner strength gained from eating <UNK> saying <UNK> etc etc to <UNK> the epic come back pretty standard formula here worth watching if only for <UNK> your youth
<START> the <UNK> of is one of the <UNK> episodes of star trek and therefore one of the most entertaining ones the entertainment factor is generally speaking <UNK> by the stand off between william shatner and the <UNK> hilarious guest star william campbell br br during an <UNK> routine mission <UNK> suddenly <UNK> into thin air and kirk follows soon after <UNK> spock immediately begins looking for his missing colleagues and though he'd hate to admit it friends while the two stranded <UNK> must deal with the mysterious all powerful flamboyant campbell the self <UNK> <UNK> of a being capable of creating or destroying anything he wants through the sheer power of his mind br br at first sight the plot may seem recycled from previous episodes honestly are there any sci fi shows that didn't feature at least one god like character but that feeling <UNK> pretty quickly thanks to the <UNK> winning use of exaggerated humor all conveyed through <UNK> deliberately camp performance his is essentially the trek version of a spoiled child in the body of an adult while his ignorance <UNK> curiosity for the human race his knowledge is quite limited probably served as inspiration for gene <UNK> when he came up with the character of q for the next generation pilot some two decades after this episode aired br br in short the key to <UNK> the <UNK> of is this silly doesn't necessarily equal bad
<START> amazing movie some of the script writing could have been better some cliched language <UNK> the dead is <UNK> to throughout the movie beautiful scenery and great acting very poetic highly recommend
<START> i generally love <UNK> as a villain how can you not and i believe that <UNK> and <UNK> are a perfect match on screen as they both are actually more nice than pretty br br this movie is great to watch although it has some major flaws br br 1 the good guy sunny not only he's so much less attractive than <UNK> what in my opinion is <UNK> important in but his role lacks character it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier br br 2 and reactions for actions are unbelievably silly and naive even for a bollywood production br br but all this is not that important in comparison with the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere great songs really truly great and let's say it again <UNK> as a villain i just love him when he's so <UNK> br br a must see along with and <UNK>
<START> following his role in the fine caper seven thieves 1960 â which <UNK> watched several years back â edward g robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types apart from the odd <UNK> role as in the <UNK> kid 1965 <UNK> previously watched the pretty good effort grand slam 1967 and apart from this <UNK> yet two more similar titles from italy to check â one of which was directed by future <UNK> lucio fulci anyway this is the kind of international production â featuring american and italian actors and a british director â which was prevalent during the 1960s <UNK> harmless and easy going in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong â especially since to <UNK> <UNK> for the heavy duty equipment required for the heist such as an army tank and an airplane the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor <UNK> first br br the gang of course is an incompetent lot led by an american robert wagner and his bimbo girlfriend <UNK> welch â the others are a black man a hungry italian and a <UNK> <UNK> they try to <UNK> an ex gangster <UNK> de <UNK> to turn over his fortune to them except <UNK> under the <UNK> of robinson he <UNK> instead a caper of 5 million worth of <UNK> needless to say the gang members trust one another wagner <UNK> welch to seduce de <UNK> so as to get the name of their fence in <UNK> â where they are to <UNK> after the robbery or else <UNK> the job <UNK> to hold up a restaurant the italian <UNK> resist sitting at table and order a multi course meal for himself <UNK> in the face of similar failures de <UNK> tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days â however ostensibly holding up a <UNK> station it <UNK> that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash br br the central heist sequence is typically elaborate while the gang including welch the train <UNK> the <UNK> wagner kidnaps pilot victor and his airplane when the job is done he fully <UNK> to double cross de <UNK> â but neither his partners nor welch herself are willing to go along with this so <UNK> forced to coming from the time when crime <UNK> pay the gang <UNK> to lose all their <UNK> in mid air when the bomb bay doors are accidentally
<START> i love the tv contest hate to see it end there are so many talented contestants it's a shame that only 2 will be picked i love watching the judges also at times they are as entertaining as the contestants i have been watching the show <UNK> every sunday night wouldn't miss it for the world it's the best reality show that's ever been on television good luck to all the contestants though i have already chosen the two who i would like to see play danny and sandy on broadway i am anxious to see if my decisions are correct i am not aware of how long the contest will go on until a danny and sandy are chosen but i will keep watching until the end
<START> wow i was told this would be a b movie worth watching i feel that i was <UNK> after seeing this preview event the plot is a twisted make of several films at best even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit i am sorry to say that i was taken to the <UNK> i wouldn't waste your time on this one this movie appears to be a bunch of <UNK> who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera being in the entertainment business i can judge a decent film and this one deserves to be <UNK> or <UNK> my advice stick to a classic like the 1979 dawn of the dead on a scale of 1 to 10 even a 1 is being nice to producers because this movie blows below limit of what sucks the producers need to stay with their daytime jobs if you do view the movie please be honest in your <UNK> this one seems to have been hyped up and <UNK> by a few there are a few who have seen this for what it is and posted correctly sorry but i have to say this is one to be <UNK>
<START> this has to rate as one of the <UNK> of tv shows in a long time br br jose <UNK> played the title character <UNK> he did the part justice and certainly looked the part but nowadays it strikes me that the <UNK> he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain <UNK> eye from the tv commercials or maybe it's the other way around br br his nemesis professor cunningham was <UNK> brilliantly by burgess meredith he never seemed to get over his penguin days from batman although he doesn't do his penguin <UNK> here he is without parallel as the <UNK> professor only john of battlestar galactica fame <UNK> up the scenery better as a <UNK> <UNK> br br i never can recall what the grudge was between <UNK> and cunningham but it must have been severe since the <UNK> never missed a chance to try and <UNK> and vice versa br br the effects were nothing special though <UNK> <UNK> submarine was way better looking than <UNK> it also had a crew of strange fish like <UNK> that served cunningham and did his every <UNK> br br however the most memorable aspect of the whole show was <UNK> <UNK> secret weapon the <UNK> <UNK> he was forever saying fire <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> would horribly the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder <UNK> truly priceless they don't make them like this anymore and perhaps just as well but like other series of this era for those who remember it it will always have an <UNK> if <UNK> covered place in our hearts
<START> for those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings who love film have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny <UNK> written dialogue then this is a film for you br br for those with a poor attention span high expectations and no brains well um you may get bored and find things dragging at times br br this is a charming modest and well paced movie with the actors <UNK> a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles i <UNK> to myself pretty much the whole way through br br this film is a little gem
<START> i was five when the show made its debut in 1958 and at a later point was a regular viewer i remember that i really enjoyed the show along with leave it to <UNK> my three sons <UNK> and harriet dick van dyke reruns of i love lucy the real <UNK> etc i am now enjoying the first season of donna reed on dvd and have watched the first two episodes donna stone is shown to be an intelligent well mannered problem solving <UNK> stay at home mom similar to june <UNK> and in contrast to lucy <UNK> in episode 2 i especially like how ms reed becomes a surrogate dad <UNK> in her dress for <UNK> and boxing <UNK> while teaching her son how to defend himself physically against a much larger bully while none of the mothers in the neighborhood i grew up in including my own exactly met the idealistic standards portrayed by ms reed it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision making <UNK> at the end of the day in contrast to today's accepted standards of <UNK> <UNK> and indifference among one's neighbors i cannot imagine jeff and mary stone being told by their parents that <UNK> in their <UNK> is okay leaving a dog outside to <UNK> all day is acceptable or telling their mother to shut up in a supermarket in front of everyone
<START> the creators of this movie must have sat down one day and said let's make fun of the russians and at the same time show people how advanced we americans are the movie portrays the russians as an inferior people who are unable to understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the americans it is true that american <UNK> are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than <UNK> in any other countries are however this movie goes to far and it <UNK> the differences between east and west to me it looked like a propaganda movie made during the cold war
<START> out of the many films i've seen tommy boy is a rare film where i can watch it over and over and it's still funny david spade and the late chris <UNK> do their best in this film and is a must see by anyone who's a fan of the spade <UNK> duo
<START> i understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren't stories but the way he tried to show time passing by the couple of who first appear <UNK> together than <UNK> with a <UNK> than the man alone and to link the adventures of the characters the final scene with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff and then seeing the boat with her former <UNK> and saying oh a boat were awful at the same time i liked the way he portrayed the middle high class even in an excessive way i think it is a lousy movie if you want to watch it do it as a film school student trying to see technical aspects and issues it will help a lot
<START> i rented this movie to get an easy entertained view of the history of texas i got a headache instead the depiction of history in this movie is so comical that even mad tv would not have done a better job
<START> this movie had terrible acting terrible plot and terrible choice of actors leslie <UNK> come on the one part i considered slightly funny was the battling fbi cia agents but because the audience was mainly kids they didn't understand that theme
<START> as their entire career was a pale <UNK> of the beatles it is no surprise that shortly after the great fiasco of the beatles magical mystery tour the <UNK> would follow up with their own insipid and creative <UNK> of a movie called head both movies are not so much a true story with a plot though <UNK> attempted to define a plot as they are a <UNK> <UNK> of skits and snippets interspersed with music and songs and out takes br br head has no plot other than the pre <UNK> four trying to break free of the box they are in i e the type casting of being <UNK> and the surrounding <UNK> and yet always finding themselves back in the box most skits involve breaks in the fourth wall and crossing over into other seemingly unrelated scenes filled with anti vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents the film <UNK> around <UNK> also to be blamed on the multiple directors br br the film like magical mystery tour is now <UNK> by some fans as wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements like <UNK> it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap br br like <UNK> head has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown <UNK> songs that are quite decent it does develop a bit more charm than <UNK> and is a bit easier to sit through but it is not ironic at all that like everything else the <UNK> did this was just a <UNK> of something the beatles did first even when it comes to laying an egg
<START> masterpiece and a movie that captures the swedish soul it also served as a great inspiration for bergman the between and with in the leading role as <UNK> from 1957 is not a coincidence don't miss it for the world
<START> i will confess that once i started watching this movie it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion quite possibly this was some <UNK> <UNK> tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim or maybe fascination that they got funding to make <UNK> and show this film that kept me searching it for merit or possibly some bizarre wish <UNK> fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain but no such luck br br so you are warned to not start watching it in the first place <UNK> the same thing happen to you there's nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half on br br the first person <UNK> and the <UNK> about <UNK> quest to <UNK> women of the <UNK> comes out even more like a <UNK> maybe <UNK> high school <UNK> that is film student project than you might imagine the effect ends up being both <UNK> at the local inhabitants who other than the two professional leads are in fact real people as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics no matter whether you take it all literally or <UNK> it's pointless and sexist br br the reason i ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a there's an <UNK> fascination of continuing to do so until it's completely off even when you know it's bad for you you just want to see what happens br br in the end this is rather <UNK> filmmaking because it seems ultimately to have no moral center no <UNK> of the local political situation nor any place in the type of political sexual personal film universe a la <UNK> in short it's got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does smug would be the one word <UNK> br br i'd suggest the filmmakers rent for a few times or hell even <UNK> witch <UNK> if they want to pursue the <UNK> with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion or at least entertainment value
<START> this could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film br br the story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the gray characters turn good and the bad guys get their just <UNK> and boom it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up br br which wouldn't have been so bad if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place but such is not the case and the movie soon becomes a goofy mess br br my advice is to watch this movie up to about the last 30 minutes and then shut it off at this point imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you have seen so far br br believe me the ending you come up with will look far better than how this film actually ends trust me on this
<START> lazy movie made by a lazy director the characters are grotesque despite the tragic of this war there is no emotion at all in the movie symbolism is artificial and <UNK> and old <UNK> woman giving a photo of her son to will her <UNK> will awake the super mother sleeping inside her a corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of <UNK> too much is sometimes worst than not enough br br this movie is only an <UNK> an empty to a woman who is not a hero she worked for united nations remember un failed to protect civilians at <UNK> who are the true heroes of this war a canadian judge leading post <UNK> trial for atrocities that happened mostly because her organization failed to prevent them where is the criticism in this movie
<START> while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics both are way above average roy <UNK> does an excellent job playing his best type a tough courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than <UNK> he played a version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws not nearly as gritty but the same get the job done despite the politicians and <UNK> approach if a man who can't swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an <UNK> <UNK> and a nerd to confront a huge killer shark isn't <UNK> then tell me what is br br tony lo <UNK> is good as a surprisingly complex villain most of the villains in fact have some depth and complexity this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings overall it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city gritty <UNK> often dangerous but filled with energy the story is spare tight and subtle it gets the job done without <UNK> elements it may not be one of the all time <UNK> but it is an exceptionally good movie br br everyone has an opinion about car chases mine is that this one is right up there with the <UNK> vs dodge <UNK> chase in <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> chevy <UNK> was similar to the <UNK> in being a <UNK> car with <UNK> up suspension and a powerful small block stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6 the <UNK> got little respect off the drag strip but with the proper suspension <UNK> they made <UNK> performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track the <UNK> of those <UNK> as they wind up is music to the ear i've heard this chase criticized for imitating the <UNK> chase the truth is that they are two works by the same master bill <UNK> who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase besides driving most of the car chase scenes he created a brooding <UNK> presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of <UNK> evil killers br br yes the chase has realism errors often noted like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the <UNK> the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 <UNK> on a <UNK> for passenger vehicles only and the <UNK> timing that allows all <UNK> to escape harm that's beside the point let's face it movie car chases are unreal by nature in <UNK> the french connection and the seven ups however bill <UNK> and phillip crafted chases far more realistic and therefore more exciting than the flying rolling exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films
<START> basically this is a very good film it is very different from <UNK> other films though which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans unlike some of the other films this does not feel like a you get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of mr <UNK> actions are not the same as we've seen before the concept of him being an <UNK> in something other than bombs and other <UNK> is a nice change although there are some unrealistic parts to the film some more obvious than others in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watch br br it <UNK> down to this if you are looking for a classic seagal action film sorry but you're going to be disappointed watch it anyway for the fun of it if you're open to seeing seagal without the action it's well worth a look i personally believe it is some of the best work he's done in quite a while br br
<START> ok if you like <UNK> monster <UNK> <UNK> stiff <UNK> and <UNK> dull but with lots of then head right for lady frankenstein a <UNK> italian corpse walker joseph <UNK> citizen kane plays the <UNK> old baron himself and must have really needed to make that <UNK> <UNK> sexy sarah bay who has played in cow european b films usually as <UNK> including <UNK> against the moon men plays his ambitious daughter a surgeon in a <UNK> prom dress <UNK> makes an ugly big headed monster it really be that much effort to make a nice one who immediately <UNK> who took his <UNK> check ran and wanders around everyone in sight bay decides to switch the brain of her lover who is old and <UNK> with the brain of a younger man who is beautiful but in order to make another monster to <UNK> the first monster <UNK> made who is wandering around people well after much exposition and some the 2 monsters <UNK> each other for a bit stabs the first monster in the back and then has sex in the <UNK> ruins of her mansion with the second monster only to have him <UNK> her <UNK> there is so much going on that you overlook the fact that the film is about as exciting as a dead and just as quickly the <UNK> video version i saw for this review was heavily edited and one wonders cow much <UNK> people were chopped out not that it would have improved the film much director von previously <UNK> a variety of grade z euro trash including jungle warriors island of the dead as mel wells and the <UNK> girls of san <UNK> the <UNK> says avoid this corpse of a film and find something that at moore of a full <UNK> br br 8
<START> close but no <UNK> that's what my opinion of this film is tag <UNK> both wrote and directed this script which should have gone through a re write before shooting at times laughable because or a corny script this film's shining star is dan jr and the director of photography both of these talents are ones to watch out for in the future my recommendation is to wait until it hits your local cable station and use the rental money on a classic
<START> i don't normally write reviews in fact i never write reviews this film was so atrocious it actually inspired me to start virtual sexuality attempts to be a light hearted and <UNK> teenage comedy regarding the usual <UNK> virginity boys etc except the main character apparently turns into her perfect boy that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair br br sound interesting well it isn't the acting is the most half hearted and appalling i have ever seen the unfortunate thing is they appear to be genuinely supportive of script and movie which probably explains why i have never seen them in any memorable production since i have not bothered to learn the actors names nor their characters the lady does not <UNK> or charm you and thus you do not care for her whatsoever the leading <UNK> male friend raises no sympathy even when the script is screaming for you to pity him the only rise he will get out of you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence the only half decent actor was the blonde leading man who despite his miserably weak role really gave it all he could which wasn't much in the light of such a horrendous piece of work i will not even talk about the acting abomination that are the <UNK> <UNK> of the plot but then again what plot br br i watched this film unfold <UNK> as i had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish <UNK> to write such a script <UNK> produce act in and direct it i can only wonder the only reason my companion and i continued to watch such a <UNK> example of film was the <UNK> laughter it managed to <UNK> out of us as <UNK> logic class and even <UNK> storyline were <UNK> within half an hour into the film i have completely no idea why anyone wanted to <UNK> the movie industry by releasing this to the public this is a joke of a film and is best left to gather dust in <UNK> for the rest of eternity 1 2 out of 10 if that
<START> reading the other comments here at the imdb i had very high expectations before seeing of the i wasn't disappointed and giving the movie an 8 i would say that i can justify that grade br br the movie has some incredible acting especially by the main person <UNK> the supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution the parents and the siblings of <UNK> the music is also worth mentioning supporting the movie throughout giving depth and feeling br br although the movie is very <UNK> it doesn't leave out some humour and has a sort of objective <UNK> about life still if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light weight this is not for you it is a story about people with mental problems about the way they are being dealt with in society but most of all a story about <UNK> br br i recommend this movie to all movie <UNK> it is one of the best movies that has ever come out of <UNK> if not out of <UNK>
<START> i thought this was a beautiful movie very brave such beautiful imagery and i liked the use of breaking glasses w applause also how the best friend repeated the line about and she's one year older than me showed that their friendship has and grown but maybe some competition is left i loved the footage of hands feeling the fabric the dance concert was beautiful the beginning seemed slow though it took awhile to feel for the characters the husband could have been more abusive he just seemed absent so when other characters talked about him it didn't really fit the affair the best friend and husband seemed random the doctors meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time left to live so when the infidelity was revealed i didn't feel as much sympathy for the character more like relief the ending was so great the lines her and the husband and the scene where she is pulled over is brilliant
<START> in the 50's a gay photographer called bob <UNK> daniel <UNK> an agency of male models releasing a muscle magazine called <UNK> <UNK> and movie of men and many of the models became prostitutes <UNK> shows the rise and fall of this <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> from the 50's <UNK> of many models and bob <UNK> himself in the present days the director <UNK> fitzgerald used this <UNK> to show naked men and lots of penis along <UNK> minutes running time in a complete bad taste and very silly crap i have never heard anything about this morally corrupt bob <UNK> and i do not know what <UNK> is in my opinion only gay and very specific audiences might like the theme of this boring and pretentious movie my vote is two br br title brazil <UNK> fresh meat
<START> while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world i think it is better than most over all i mean it had it's little laughs and just all around a good feeling it's not too often we get to see two old <UNK> just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes walter and jack had such a great chemistry together as friends brother in laws just watching them <UNK> these women was fun and you <UNK> for them all the way because <UNK> we have to admit it or not for their age they still had game d i loved just the whole plot of being able to move on and having fun no matter how old you are i'd recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one br br 7 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> most famous movie has truly <UNK> the test of time the story of a <UNK> aboard a <UNK> in <UNK> does have the feeling of soviet propaganda but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt the scene on the <UNK> steps should remain <UNK> into anyone's mind br br okay so the <UNK> <UNK> wasn't actually the first movie to use montage but they did a great job with it here certainly any film history class should show this movie it's a great historical drama although i will admit that i don't know how accurate it is a 10 10 br br oh and we should have learned by now that <UNK> should be <UNK> as <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie yesterday and like most wrote i also expected a steven movie god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very <UNK> in had a little doubts cause i read that <UNK> rule was playing in it but i thought hopefully they give him a role so i don't get <UNK> by watching him and <UNK> the opposite <UNK> steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a crew like this steven was broke and needed cash <UNK> what a big <UNK> if you like steven movie <UNK> skip this one its pure drama you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3 10 but the acting of <UNK> rule <UNK> up the whole movie for his buddy <UNK> with his irritating hood talk br br my beer went from <UNK> fresh to water we do the <UNK> in the story didn't had any good about it to me it felt like a 3 year old produced it br br hopefully steven makes me happy again in a future movie people this isn't even worth renting as that br br to bad and <UNK>
<START> three children are born at the exact same time during a <UNK> <UNK> just before their <UNK> birthday they <UNK> on a killing spree bloody birthday is a typical slasher from early 80's it's a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudity the evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspense there is also no gore or scares in bloody birthday but the film is mildly entertaining unfortunately no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal <UNK> the murder scenes are quite gruesome for example we've got death by <UNK> baseball bat skipping rope and <UNK> so if you're a fan of early 80's slasher movies give this one a look
<START> the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great <UNK> and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process it's car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of <UNK> the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score mark <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> deserve better scripts warning if you've seen the trailer then you have seen the movie if you're looking for entertainment at <UNK> <UNK> then you need the italian job
