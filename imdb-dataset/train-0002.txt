<START> although i had seen <UNK> in a theater way back in <UNK> i couldn't remember anything of the plot except for vague images of kurt thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending br br after reading some of the other reviews i picked up a copy of the newly released dvd to once again enter the world of <UNK> br br it turns out this is one of those films produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today the film stars champion <UNK> kurt thomas as jonathan <UNK> <UNK> out of the blue to <UNK> the nation of <UNK> to enter and hopefully win the game a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like <UNK> power the goal of the mission involves the star wars defense system jonathan is trained in the martial arts by princess <UNK> who never speaks or leaves the house once trained tries to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red <UNK> with <UNK> of blue and white needless to say <UNK> finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of <UNK> on his way to a date with destiny and the game br br star kurt thomas was ill served by director robert <UNK> who it looks like was never on the set the so called script is just this side of incompetent see other reviews for the many <UNK> throughout the town of <UNK> has a few good moments but is ultimately ruined by bad editing the ending <UNK> still there's the <UNK> of a good action adventure here a hong kong version with more visceral action and faster pace might even be pretty good
<START> i had never seen a silent movie until july 24 2005 i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it i've seen thousands of movies very few are hypnotic to me i found last of the <UNK> and unforgettable ray liotta to be hypnotic so consider the source as you read this i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was who has been credited by many for <UNK> hollywood i had no idea what i was in for two hours later i <UNK> out of it and realized i'd watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen playing a role perfectly suited to her imagine a movie fan in <UNK> having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that <UNK> before you would have to see her again and again the setting was perfect for a girl that <UNK> she was a poor <UNK> couldn't speak the king's english but you had to admire her what a movie time to start my mary pickford movie collection
<START> apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of europe including germany <UNK> and the whole central and eastern europe as well as the hitler and <UNK> era <UNK> and a lot of forgotten trials all over europe was a revenge and injustice of the winners what do you think why were not any american british french or soviet <UNK> after the wwii there were no american british etc war crimes there were no <UNK> no <UNK> no tokyo no <UNK> no <UNK> no berlin no <UNK> and so on the germans had war crimes too but in <UNK> the justice was not a real consideration the main point was <UNK> <UNK> germany must <UNK> that was also a book title in america 1941 br br this film is an awful <UNK> american <UNK> <UNK> full of error lie propaganda prejudice and injustice and first of all full of <UNK> but not surprisingly why wasn't enough the <UNK> process itself this film is a nightmare total darkness after 60 years this darkness and hate and <UNK> and lack of self criticism is the real cause of the <UNK> in korea vietnam cambodia <UNK> iraq and so forth and there are no american war criminals bravo america very clever even <UNK> would become <UNK> of it
<START> very slight spoiler br br this movie despite being only on tv is absolutely excellent i <UNK> t really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so i can t really comment on that the acting in this was so good i had to <UNK> myself and say remember it s only a movie this <UNK> t really happen as i sat and listened to harris and quinn talk i knew that it was exactly what john and paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting the <UNK> comments and burns from john were right on with his character especially in the restaurant as was his depression while paul was very easy going and laid back both actors did and excellent job and i was thrilled to have seen this movie it s a wicked experience for any beatles fan and prepare for a few surprises
<START> in one respect it's like 'the wizard of oz ' with paris in black and white and the <UNK> in color but it's supposedly about <UNK> love <UNK> and moral <UNK> while actually being about designer <UNK> shots of the <UNK> lots of big expensive cars and music and dancing <UNK> that suggest <UNK> minnelli on one of his off days watchable but a remarkable example of desperate dark plot material and <UNK> style heading in opposite directions was this the model for 'the talented mister <UNK> does anyone sense an <UNK> between jean <UNK> and matt damon
<START> i bought this dvd without any previous reference but the names of john huston <UNK> welch mae west and farrah fawcett on its cover i found the brazilian title very weird but i decided to watch expecting to see a funny comedy maybe like switch however the non sense story is awful and hard to be described <UNK> <UNK> rex reed is <UNK> to a surgery to change his sex in <UNK> and he returns to hollywood telling that she is to be myra <UNK> <UNK> welch and claiming half the property of his uncle buck loner john huston along the days myra and her alter ego <UNK> corrupt a young couple in her <UNK> academy with kinky sex in a certain moment the messy screenplay is so confused that i believe the whole story was only a mind trip of <UNK> induced by the accident unfortunately the <UNK> of <UNK> welch and farrah fawcett are not enough to hold this flick my vote is three br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> man woman up to a point
<START> the premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably sally <UNK> and anthony <UNK> is charming but this film is near unwatchable the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the <UNK> free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a <UNK> <UNK> open on the lap most of the singing is off key i think they may have filmed with the singing <UNK> and put in the music under it the dialogue is really stupid and trite the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it <UNK> to often into stupid <UNK> sub plots i found myself checking my watch after <UNK> first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering <UNK> is it ever going to end '
<START> martin sheen michelle phillips stuart <UNK> and the late <UNK> <UNK> are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death mr sheen mr <UNK> and mr <UNK> all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles ms phillips has the slightly less than <UNK> task of trying to spice up a made for tv movie twenty five years ago by <UNK> the sex interest in an otherwise <UNK> film the real star however is the california kid a 1934 ford <UNK> borrowed from jake <UNK> put before a camera and given a <UNK> that'll leave the viewer <UNK> <UNK> and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation br br the action scenes are spectacular although some of the dialog is a bit lame making for a fine <UNK> <UNK> this is how all car movies should be made br br try to catch this one on the late movie channel it's well worth the missed sleep
<START> when i read other comment i decided to watch this movie br br first cast specially michael madsen and <UNK> <UNK> good enough br br film very intelligence and interesting because cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and <UNK> br br second story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion br br third final chapter is not special or interesting it's regular like other action movies br br finally i recommend to watch this movie and i hope you'll love it enjoy d
<START> this is one of those movies like dave american <UNK> and local hero that holds a viewer's interest time and again lightweight movies seldom win oscars but whoever did the casting for <UNK> deserves one even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming it's still enjoyable to watch how the various plot <UNK> develop true all the drama is melodrama but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background my favorite line comes from whoopi goldberg now why can't i write sh t like that i think it's unfortunate that the tv and website censors insist on all this unnecessary <UNK>
<START> i went to see hamlet because i was in between jobs i figured 4 hours would be great i've been a fan of branagh dead again henry v i was completely overwhelmed by the direction acting cinematography that this film captured like other reviews the 4 hours passes <UNK> branagh doesn't play hamlet he is hamlet he was born for this when i watch this film i'm constantly trying to find faults i've looked at the goofs and haven't noticed them how he was able to move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me this movie was shot in 70 <UNK> it's a shame that columbia hasn't released a widescreen version of this on vhs i own a dvd player and i'd take this over titanic any day so columbia if you're listening put this film out the way it should be watched and i don't know what happened at the oscars this should have swept best picture best actor best direction best cinematography what films were they watching i felt sorry for branagh at the oscars when he did a tribute to shakespeare on the screen they should have been giving a tribute to branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time
<START> i just watched this movie in one word <UNK> the story is bad the acting is if possible even worse the movie has one or two nice moments but thats it and having those two small good moments doesn't make up for anything in between before or after those moments a <UNK> of a movie not even worth watching on tv
<START> n b spoilers within <UNK> an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that director's mind but directing a wagner opera is an especially <UNK> task as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold hans <UNK> <UNK> loads this filming of <UNK> <UNK> final masterpiece with enough <UNK> ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the <UNK> you get more than a piece of the director you get the whole <UNK> <UNK> and then some <UNK> is to be admired for his <UNK> for <UNK> back the covers on the <UNK> aspects of german history but does it work to <UNK> that desire to a wagner opera already <UNK> with its own concepts br br the scenes with the knights of the holy grail in acts i and iii are especially laden with visual allegory and symbolism these are drawn come from <UNK> own time from long before and go well beyond if you know what these things mean they can <UNK> <UNK> vision for you but not necessarily enhance <UNK> vision if you don't know what they mean they're simply confusing if not annoying i won't bother <UNK> the plot of the opera here suffice it to say it is a typical <UNK> <UNK> of diverse elements in this case a <UNK> of the holy grail legend with the principles practices and <UNK> of christianity the theme of redemption plays the main role here as in nearly every wagner opera br br i personally had to sweat to get through <UNK> first act amidst my jarring <UNK> the music saved the day but act ii picks up the pace here we meet <UNK> the evil <UNK> out to <UNK> the wandering innocent fool <UNK> the greatest <UNK> of them all <UNK> will be used to <UNK> him to the dark side after an initial <UNK> with more symbols these get stripped away and the long gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> between young fool and <UNK> really takes off finally the film starts working a genuine magic and it is <UNK> due to <UNK> choosing to set things naturally and simply suddenly the acting starts to work the <UNK> actress edith clever and the <UNK> soprano of <UNK> <UNK> team to create a wondrous <UNK> suddenly the music seems to come to life and make vivid the inner turmoil of the two characters the camera work stays simple and quietly fluid in other words wagner is allowed to tell his story more on his own terms and it works beautifully for me it was the most engrossing part of the film br br with the re entrance of the knights in part 2 of act iii the weird <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately creep back in some other loony <UNK> ideas using a huge wagner death mask as a major set piece causing the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> large dressing the act iii knights in all manner of costumes <UNK> and makeup what is the director saying that the knights are a bunch of <UNK> that they express multiple or timeless layers of significance beyond their surface functions it's <UNK> guess the <UNK>  just after the incredibly touching <UNK> of <UNK> by <UNK>  of rear projection footage of the conductor <UNK> in modern day realism his orchestra in the studio this completely <UNK> my dramatic thread <UNK> a few minutes to <UNK> the complete <UNK> of having any time pass between acts ii and iii when we meet the knight and narrator <UNK> again he should be an old old man and <UNK> should re emerge as a world weary but <UNK> middle aged man but certainly the most bizarre stroke is to split the <UNK> character into male female <UNK> some find this the most brilliant stroke no doubt i can credit <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> 2 with acting of strength and dignity she also happens to be the best lip <UNK> of the whole cast but please <UNK> conception of <UNK> is already so complex his growth from a completely innocent boy who knows nothing of his past to his breakthrough realization in act ii of what <UNK> eternal wound means and how it has become his own to his return as the great <UNK> of act iii  this is the journey of a masterfully constructed character the <UNK> sexual emphasis is just <UNK> and absurd and what's with this nonsense about a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> can't we just accept a mentor apprentice relationship which is <UNK> <UNK> in act iii br br the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under <UNK> jordan plays with passion and beauty though the chorus is disappointing but after watching this film i only wanted to whip out my <UNK> led recording highly recommended and get my <UNK> <UNK> straight again the film experience for me <UNK> from bizarre to entertaining to <UNK> to <UNK> credit he's created a visually <UNK> work and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera but instead of sticking to <UNK> he seems to have wanted to bring in all things <UNK> the man the life the enormous influence all of it in crude symbolic code <UNK> the opera is already full of <UNK> symbolism the grail the <UNK> the holy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ever bleeding wound <UNK> self <UNK> the kiss <UNK> curse and on and on this is not to mention the musical symbolism sounding constantly in the score in the form of <UNK> <UNK> system <UNK> itself is one huge symbol getting back to my first paragraph question <UNK> whole <UNK> is all way too much for me but if this project sounds like something to <UNK> your fancy then go for it i won't recommend just staying away from this you may find yourself <UNK> satisfied or if you need something to crack your wagner <UNK> try it but please please don't stop here <UNK> is in a late very <UNK> league of its own
<START> i'm a big fan of morgan freeman 'the <UNK> <UNK> ranks at the top of my all time favorite movies but i have to admit that i have often wondered about his choice of roles so many of his titles were big budget clichés with no heart <UNK> items or <UNK> for me marks the return of freeman to a role that truly showcases his considerable acting talents br br freeman plays an <UNK> <UNK> big time hollywood actor who hasn't worked in several years he has been offered a part in an <UNK> <UNK> picture for which he is doing some research at a <UNK> store in a poor neighborhood in la after being stranded there by his <UNK> driver freeman is offered a ride home by <UNK> girl scarlet paz vega whom he has semi <UNK> before she can take him home however scarlet has a big job interview she needs to get to and freeman agrees to tag along in exchange for the ride br br the movie follows scarlet and freeman to several locations but the movie is really just a character piece about the interactions between the two freeman is the quintessential <UNK> hollywood type who hasn't heard of target and doesn't know his own <UNK> number or even what day of the week it is he <UNK> wisdom from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> thru his 'the whole world is but a <UNK> mentality and repeatedly calls <UNK> job interview an <UNK> and yet he has a way with people a way of affecting them that <UNK> beyond his fame he is a fan of humanity he studies them asks <UNK> questions about them and <UNK> in their quirks where others would simply be annoyed in scarlet he sees the stubborn proud loner that he was he sees the man he used to be br br scarlet for her part displays a fierce pride and sharp tongue that serve to hide her own <UNK> about herself vega plays the role with a connection to freeman that <UNK> the line between an almost <UNK> love and physical attraction although she plays it beautifully and it's not at all as creepy as it sounds but even as she feels her connection to freeman grow scarlet has a keen eye for the reality of their different worlds and cuts thru <UNK> hollywood bull hit with a sharp <UNK> that refuses to accept anything but the truth br br the movie is smart funny and well written with dialogue that is simple but effective i read one imdb review that said the lines were <UNK> which i think is a <UNK> of realistic human speech there are no big <UNK> here no deep soul searching moments and so the trick is i think to show how people in ordinary everyday life can <UNK> connections with one another and i think freeman and vega pull it off beautifully painting a picture of a bond between two people that <UNK> like sun on the ocean <UNK> and <UNK> long after it's gone it lives on in your memories <UNK> you with what might have been ok that was a bit <UNK> but i really did like the performances and the movie i would definitely recommend it
<START> they had me from the first show br br welcome to <UNK> county a sleepy little <UNK> like place with one slight difference the sheriff is really satan there's the spoiler not like you wouldn't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway br br oh but that's not all it turns out that satan has a son named <UNK> some people are trying to keep him good but it's an <UNK> battle sheriff buck satan knows who <UNK> is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness subtle <UNK> he doesn't always come off as evil most of the time he's a hero everyone owes him a big favor because he often sets up a <UNK> and saves them from it so every time you think someone will finally take him down one of his friends comes out of nowhere to <UNK> it br br in one of my favorite episodes lucas and <UNK> were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them lucas used it as an excuse to teach <UNK> a lesson about evil br br the <UNK> ted was <UNK> to shoot them lucas told <UNK> that ted had half a conscience if he had no conscience he would have shot them by now if he had a real conscience he never would have become a criminal so he started calling him half ted it was pretty funny he was <UNK> the criminals and of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of half ted at all times and of course he was in complete control at all times they actually had you <UNK> satan br br very very excellent show it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time twilight zone night stalker circle of fear american gothic supernatural br br that's good company
<START> paris je t'aime 2006 is a film made up of 18 segments you can do the <UNK> 18 segments in <UNK> minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story the movie is based on the premise that you can indeed tell a story in that short amount of time the premise works almost all of the segments are powerful complete and satisfying each presents a different aspect of the <UNK> experience and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near great actors br br there were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it's hard to pick one or two favorites probably the most memorable to me were juliette <UNK> as a <UNK> mother in the segment place des <UNK> gena rowlands as an aging beauty in <UNK> latin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a maid in the segment <UNK> du <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> mail <UNK> who has learned to speak french so she can visit paris <UNK> <UNK> segment br br special mention must be given to <UNK> <UNK> probably the <UNK> little boy to ever <UNK> an american tourist in a <UNK> <UNK> station segment <UNK> br br this is an outstanding movie my wife and i decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed however paris is photographed so beautifully that i would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen in any case don't miss it
<START> what was with all the turkish actors no offense but i thought it was all for nothing for all these actors the film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability it <UNK> next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him the script was so bad their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional br br even the sound effects of the <UNK> at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a <UNK> it was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns a video game had better sound effects than this film there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like lets get the f k out of here and what are we going to do man he sounded like a girl as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too for a few seconds <UNK> <UNK> dumb film poor madsen he will <UNK> back
<START> this is one of the funniest movies that i have seen this year the people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted it is a beautiful thing there were a lot of quality one liners this movie blew uncle sam out of the water it was made by <UNK> same people i think
<START> as others have noted this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the <UNK> life and i for one was very annoyed and offended by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair by the <UNK> that her rapist was responsible for <UNK> her talent ' by its complete disregard for her work by the way it turned her into a sex object on and on you get the idea also i find it disturbing that people who aren't familiar with <UNK> will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her
<START> the sun was not shining it was too wet to play so i went to the movies that cold cold wet date day br br the cat in the hat was the name of the flick and when it was over my stomach was sick br br mike myers played the cat his humor was lame and kids <UNK> see this the humor was not tame br br the film was like drinking milk from a <UNK> cow so it is fun to have fun yet the filmmakers didn't know how br br this film in short is atrocious the acting was bad the plot was <UNK> too much and the humor was surprisingly very crude br br it starts with conrad and sally a rule <UNK> and a future sheriff when their mother has to go to work she gets mrs <UNK> to <UNK> possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs <UNK> is watching a <UNK> court room a la c span she soon falls asleep and here comes the cat br br the film starts to spiral out of control the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun he's got thing 1 and thing 2 who suddenly start <UNK> the house he <UNK> a tv <UNK> and accidentally <UNK> his tail off and when the cat goes full carmen miranda it's not funny possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie <UNK> and there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat br br too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk or <UNK> your tail off br br soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog who has the key to a <UNK> on his collar if the <UNK> is not locked soon their house will be home to the <UNK> universe here it gets a little more interesting but not enough to save the film br br the acting overall is horrible mike meyers brings his brand of <UNK> austin powers humor to the cat saying things like you dirty ho and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a <UNK> in the <UNK> while posing as a <UNK> spencer <UNK> is great as the trouble making conrad and <UNK> fanning is cute as sally though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous <UNK> <UNK> waiting to kill john ritter accident waiting to happen alec <UNK> slick and <UNK> lawrence quinn is disgusting ever trying to woo the kids mom who is played by kelly preston and sean hayes is mr <UNK> mom's boss and is also the voice of the fish the latter three are also bland br br overall if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into <UNK> humor cause there's plenty of it and more save your 7 00 and see something else as the late great dr seuss once said br br it is fun to have fun but you have to know how really universal stop <UNK> already turning over in his grave br br like my mom always says <UNK> killed the cat the cat in the hat out of
<START> okay i rented this movie because of the director he has made some interesting flicks in the past if you haven't seen <UNK> you are missing a fun ride anyway i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look it's bad very bad if you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead first of all the old saying <UNK> can't judge a book by it's <UNK> applies here the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights the back of the box has a cool shot of the red leather jill and some other shots the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place inexplicably in 1977 jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover the movie is not quite as predictable as you would think and that's not a good thing characters do so many stupid things without any <UNK> of motivation it's embarrassing to watch 10 minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason also what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him anthony <UNK> the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script had it been set in the underworld of the new <UNK> and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent to set it in the 70's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever avoid it
<START> this movie feels so empty in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10 because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird br br the acting was horrible it's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives looking at the floor for their marks br br spoilers also you'll find yourself <UNK> your head watching the movie at one point at sky <UNK> home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the <UNK> they have advanced warning an attack is coming so what do they do nothing all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain br br the entire world is under attack and he's the only person ever fighting back at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of <UNK> taking off finally but what do they do nothing the movie is over
<START> it may have not been up for academy awards and admittedly it's pretty cheesy but it's just so much fun nothing makes me smile like bill and ted lovable optimistic and hilarious bill and ted are a great way to <UNK> br br although i love excellent adventure bogus journey is funnier to me death is <UNK> hilarious and bill and ted are even more endearing people give me grief about loving this movie but only really pretentious movie <UNK> will say it's not even a bit entertaining if you like this you'll probably also be a fan of wayne's world dude where's my car and dumb and dumber admit it though foolish they make you grin and turn your <UNK> box over so watch them just for kicks and <UNK>
<START> two kinds of movies we like are 1 westerns and 2 movies from 30 or 40 years ago we ought to have liked a man called <UNK> but br br but this picture is <UNK> annoying and stupid from start to finish since there is nobody in the story good or bad to warm up to there is nobody to <UNK> the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested no <UNK> among the guys trying to steal the gold and no <UNK> among those trying to protect it <UNK> has a pretty girl friend but there's no reason why she <UNK> all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no account pig br br the film also suffers from an <UNK> and <UNK> musical score and from extremely bad writing and direction by <UNK> <UNK> br br of the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault this was the rock bottom the only true dud in the bunch
<START> this is the best movie i have ever seen br br i've seen the movie on dutch television sometime in 1988 br br that month they were showing a <UNK> movie every sunday night br br the next week there was another great movie involving a train rather than a bus the name of which i don't remember if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where please tell me at <UNK> let <UNK> <UNK> br br the next week there was another great movie involving a train rather than a bus the name of which i don't remember if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where please tell me at <UNK> let <UNK> <UNK>
<START> as a fan of author john le <UNK> i've slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them i found this 1987 adaptation of le <UNK> <UNK> at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking i would know what to expect i was surprised to discover that my expectations were <UNK> in this miniseries a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama br br peter <UNK> gives a great performance as <UNK> <UNK> the perfect spy of the title carrying on in the long tradition of le <UNK> strong main characters <UNK> is also quite possibly the best <UNK> plays <UNK> who in fact contains many shades of author le <UNK> as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and <UNK> sometimes out of <UNK> and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming a perfect spy <UNK> plays <UNK> to perfection as a man always on the run if not from others then from himself <UNK> alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone br br <UNK> <UNK> is a fantastic supporting cast ray <UNK> gives one of his finest performances as <UNK> con man father rick who as le <UNK> has said is based strongly on the author's own father <UNK> plays a man who comes in and out of <UNK> life and is one of the those responsible for <UNK> becoming a perfect spy in fact if it wasn't for <UNK> performance a year after this in a very british coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career br br the rest of the supporting is excellent as well from caroline john as <UNK> mother to alan howard as his spy mentor to <UNK> <UNK> as the young <UNK> friend turned <UNK> to jane booker as <UNK> wife the supporting cast is fantastic special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger <UNK> jonathan <UNK> nicholas <UNK> and <UNK> taylor who establish the young man who would become the man played so well by peter <UNK> br br the production values of the miniseries are strong as well as the miniseries adaptations of <UNK> <UNK> soldier spy and <UNK> people proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format the locations are excellent from the english locations to the those scattered across eastern europe and the usa as are the sets by chris <UNK> the cinematography of elmer <UNK> adds an extra <UNK> of realism to the world of the miniseries yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script br br <UNK> arthur <UNK> <UNK> the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently the novel was largely at least in its early parts <UNK> in that <UNK> early life <UNK> much of john le <UNK> life the script for this miniseries is no exception as it <UNK> the development of <UNK> <UNK> from young boy to a perfect spy never once does the miniseries <UNK> from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage if one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight fist fight or james bond style car chase this would be the proof while the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it br br though it might be overlong for some for those who don't have very short attention <UNK> here is a must see from the performances of peter <UNK> and ray <UNK> to fine production values and a fine literary script a perfect spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see it is a fascinating trip down the history of the cold war yet it is more then that it is also a trip down what john le <UNK> has called the secret path the path of the spy the man who must lie and <UNK> to survive as much a human drama as a spy thriller a perfect spy isn't to be missed
<START> remakes and sequels have been a <UNK> of cinema from the beginning of the media it is pretty much a hit or miss venture though if you take what's good of the original and build upon it and update key features too current standards you can have a success note such films like the thief of bagdad <UNK> 1940 or king kong 1933 2005 succeeded in their attempts others like king kong 1976 fail miserably br br brief encounter 1945 is the <UNK> for this film it is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it imdb ten the story is simple love <UNK> found by accident and <UNK> lost why it just happened for the two 2 principals involved at the wrong time these are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by <UNK> howard and <UNK> johnson neither are <UNK> leading star material but quality character actors for the details watch the film br br now what went wrong a t v movie remade practically scene for scene with name actors richard burton and sophia loren should have at least scored imdb six both actors though appear <UNK> just showing up to punch their time <UNK> and pick up their <UNK> neither are involved with their characters or with each other you do not believe they are in love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them that should not be and that's why it fails in its intent sometimes it is just better to leave things alone
<START> this film revolves as much around japanese culture as it does the lives of one modern japanese family physical contact is <UNK> upon for those over 7 especially in public hence all that <UNK> instead of <UNK> even when you are close friends relatives ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too never the less ballroom dancing is on the quite immensely popular people who do ballroom dancing in japan are viewed a bit like <UNK> in the west many more would like to than do but are <UNK> by the culture a delightful family film which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone i understand that it was more popular than titanic in japan i guess the japanese are just like the rest of us they like to be <UNK> too
<START> the story for the first aired television installment of columbo is simple one half of successful mystery writing team does away with the other frames an unseen mafia group is <UNK> by an admirer does away with the admirer and is tricked up by the <UNK> columbo br br with that said this is still one of the most entertaining in the show's history <UNK> tremendously by the work of the late jack cassidy and star peter falk br br besides the <UNK> of being directed by a young steven spielberg the episode also has a air of the macabre because of the future of two of its stars cassidy and barbara <UNK> the two share several scenes together and it is poignant that both would die <UNK> within a decade of this filming cassidy in an apartment fire and <UNK> at the hands of <UNK> yet to be found after over three decades br br now both <UNK> are true life mysteries
<START> adorable i saw domestic <UNK> in <UNK> in october with my kids we all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents i haven't heard them laugh like that in years it was the first time that i can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy it's really cute and we can't wait for it to come out on dvd they need to make more movies like domestic <UNK> it is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy and not be embarrassed i have not seen a movie this cute since my big fat greek wedding i loved <UNK> sterling as the mother she was also in austin powers howard <UNK> is in this too and he is hilarious i remember him from <UNK>
<START> starting off here's a synopsis porno queen <UNK> lee <UNK> <UNK> is murdered by her <UNK> lover max george shannon in a game of sexual russian <UNK> <UNK> other lover icy lesbian casting agent <UNK> stone mary <UNK> provides an <UNK> for max but <UNK> has an agenda of her own and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress julie <UNK> again in a web of sexual mind games when the <UNK> identities are <UNK> <UNK> the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most <UNK> <UNK> encounter br br though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention i find it to be a sexy suspenseful gem cult <UNK> <UNK> has one of her best ever roles and she and sexy innocent <UNK> play off each other well the unsettling music provided by <UNK> kingsley plus two original songs all american boy you say you've never let me down and the <UNK> sally go <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> a memorable soundtrack theodore <UNK> direction is sharp with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest <UNK> business <UNK> under <UNK> upper <UNK> with tons of great new york atmosphere <UNK> <UNK> friend and fellow <UNK> giving a great performance in a small role and exotic <UNK> van <UNK> as <UNK> ex wife in a comic sub plot this sub plot though amusing looks like it belongs in another movie altogether however i'm not complaining as the film is smooth even as it changes <UNK> and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic thriller garbage currently being <UNK> out br br trivia sugar <UNK> was originally rated x soft core and released by general film corporation in 1973 i am the proud owner of an original one sheet poster lucky me in 1977 the movie was cut for an r and re released by troma team which now offers it uncut on <UNK> mary <UNK> was the wife of theodore <UNK> at the time and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian <UNK> sex scenes with him <UNK> behind the camera she can also be seen in two of his earlier productions <UNK> 1970 and silent night bloody night 1972
<START> <UNK> from the real life exploits of chuck <UNK> and steve <UNK> in <UNK> new york the <UNK> is high energy and good natured br br but be warned casual racial <UNK> flow off the <UNK> of wallace <UNK> and little jackie cooper the very first shot might be startling this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere br br <UNK> as <UNK> is the <UNK> thunder at the center of the action a loud mouth saloon keeper with his own fire <UNK> and he has a soft spot for <UNK> orphan cooper raft as <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> better looking rival in almost every <UNK> <UNK> could never turn down a dare and loved attention leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge it is still <UNK> whether he actually jumped or used a <UNK> br br <UNK> is as <UNK> as ever with a put on irish american accent he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children cats and ladies in distress this is possibly the most <UNK> character raft ever played and he even gets to throw in a little dancing as well as a show of leg and again he mistakes the leading lady lovely fay <UNK> for a prostitute cooper is as tough as either of them though he gets a chance to turn on the tears br br the highlight isn't the jump off the bridge but a no holds <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> that in <UNK> looks like a real <UNK> between the principals it's sure someone <UNK> more than an ego
<START> i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire there were numerous political and social messages the names make refer to some other names etc it might be i cannot realize such things i don't want to do anyway because i am not interested in i am interested in <UNK> as for the movie itself again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful i could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half yes that scene says somethings about humanity but it does not make the movie brilliant the movie is entertaining mildly and exciting in some moments or scenes but no more than that as for the biggest flaw of the movie it is visual effects it was just shocking i could not pull myself together for a while because i had expected a realistic monster because it is not one of the old <UNK> movies it was made in 2006 but it was not it is like if you don't believe that there is a monster you cannot care about if you agree with me about this i highly recommend you <UNK> that is extremely realistic the design of the monster is not interesting but at least planned there is an effort dramatically powerful critique some critics talk about it as if it is a kurosawa movie yes it is rather a drama than a thriller or action but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful i don't want to compare the host with other monster movies but i try to mean that the host does not do something that other monster movies do not do by the way may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for asian cinema yes i like asian cinema too but this is the fact
<START> i went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be <UNK> by scoop happily the film <UNK> expectations at least a little bit it's nothing heavy nothing deep and not anywhere as good as any number of real allen masterpieces but it's also completely enjoyable as a light <UNK> comedy there's something kind of simple and sweet about it cute was the word i heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show it doesn't feel like allen set out to create a masterpiece here it feels like he wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it compared to just about everything hollywood is producing allen's stuff has a tendency to charm even the <UNK> stuff these days it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by an actual human being
<START> there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long <UNK> between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore we don't always even know their names as we are never presented to each other and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are it's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such because <UNK> might spoil fond memories or we don't know do they we are too afraid to check that out br br the movie <UNK> <UNK> just caught me watching it i never had intention to watch it through but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting i gave a look for the rest of the film i didn't know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives
<START> many reviews here explain the story and characters of <UNK> <UNK> in some detail so i won't do that i just want to add my comment that i believe the film is a wonderful <UNK> of life br br at the beginning myrtle gordon is remembering how <UNK> it was to act when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth experience has left her emotionally fragile wondering what her life has been for and indeed if she can even continue living a tragic accident <UNK> a personal crisis that almost <UNK> her br br almost but not quite at the <UNK> hour she <UNK> the power of her art and <UNK> herself i'm going to bury that bastard she says of fellow actor maurice as she goes on stage it seems almost sadistic when <UNK> director <UNK> people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance he knows however that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all br br some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on <UNK> <UNK> path i believe this is truly her <UNK> <UNK> she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action she sees a way forward it is tremendously moving br br gena rowlands is superb the film is superb thank you mr cassavetes wherever you are
<START> this is one of my favorite movies of all time i loved rain man with dustin hoffman and tom cruise this movie is in some ways similar but makes rain man seem artificial shallow <UNK> and trivial by comparison
<START> it seems there's a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema namely happy endings aren't very common beautiful thing <UNK> gay films tend to end in broken relationships or <UNK> death and some like come <UNK> just end period br br the creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot direction and <UNK> within the first ten minutes of this film i found myself a bit confused and even more so after the first glimpse of <UNK> <UNK> character having a little <UNK> session it seems this film was randomly <UNK> together without the slightest attempt at continuity or <UNK> there's no real way to tell when you're viewing the present or some sort of <UNK> flashback i could only take so much before it became truly unappealing br br stephen <UNK> of the new york times called this film <UNK> beautiful and utterly real well it seems that stephen invested in beer <UNK> prior to viewing as this is truly far from beautiful due to all the praise this film received i expected something worth watching sadly the film lived down to its title and by the end of the movie which provided no resolution whatsoever i might add it's plain to see that the writers the director and the film have all come <UNK>
<START> it's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being <UNK> by wild <UNK> and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds meryl streep gives the performance of her life melodramatic overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror br br if comedies about the <UNK> being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and yes it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving streep a showcase for her aussie accent and facial <UNK> br br throwing in a slam at media bias and <UNK> and disregard for either the truth or <UNK> gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad
<START> this is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama it is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like the ring or the grudge will be disappointed what really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be <UNK> consistent i also appreciated the absence of dr phil <UNK> or new age <UNK> rather than <UNK> an agenda the filmmakers just told the story told it well and let the viewer think about it the sparse <UNK> were reminiscent of <UNK> paintings and amazingly effective br br a great example of how to make a good film on a small budget without big studios star actors big name directors this was far better than many of hitchcock's films special effects or clever plot twists
<START> contrary to most other <UNK> i deeply hate this series br br it starts out looking interesting with mysterious aliens and giant robots and i kept my hopes up until the very last episode at the end of it i still didn't understand what the alien attacks were all about maybe i missed something who knows and realized that i had sat through 26 episodes <UNK> mainly of the characters' own self hating <UNK> and self <UNK> it actually <UNK> between alien robot fights and these dark depressing <UNK> on and off scenes where one or more characters can just say or shout i hate me you it 10 12 times in a row br br i can't really see either <UNK> or <UNK> two of the main characters showing growth or change nor can i see any of the other characters learning or growing either for that matter i wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episodes and the feeling didn't change during the last ones <UNK> truly possesses the kind of helpless <UNK> that makes people angry rather than <UNK> and <UNK> is such an <UNK> know it all that i wanted to smash the tv screen every time she came into view oh and more than anyone else these two hate everything and say it <UNK> often br br i'm otherwise a big fan of <UNK> and manga and never before have i disliked one so much i read that the series creator writer wrote this while suffering from a depression and i can believe that it made me depressed to watch it is that the aim of this series i'm honestly asking is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed and if suffering from a depression why just not write a book or biography about it instead of mixing it up with aliens and <UNK> this alien war plot as far as i could tell lead to absolutely nowhere br br finally since i'm truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this <UNK> of dead end plots i can't help but wonder how many of them actually find it good and how many say they do because they've been told it is
<START> shaggy scooby doo get a clue it's like watching a much loved relative in the final throws of a <UNK> illness clearly the work of people with no soul no love or respect for the original work what in the name of all that's holy were they thinking of it seems they were trying to go all post modern and ironic instead it's just abysmal <UNK> what's the point in taking up a successful franchise like <UNK> <UNK> if you just going to <UNK> it down the toilet my son loves the original series and even some of the spin off movies but he can't stand this drivel and let's face it you can't argue against the tastes of a seven year old
<START> i'm writing this 9 years after the final episode was aired and i am still <UNK> from the impact <UNK> has had on me br br it has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded but it took it further and didn't stray from the realism of the streets often portraying life events and characters down to a t br br i am sorely missing this series instead we have are given the stupid <UNK> which is over <UNK> and acted creating a whole load of american esquire garbage br br <UNK> stayed true to the <UNK> of sydney and for that i am truly <UNK> to this wonderful series the acting was a grade and it's a shame to see only a few actors have <UNK> their career whilst others have faded into obscurity br br i don't want australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history thus i ask the abc to release the complete series on dvd not the first three give this series the ending it deserves
<START> watching josh kornbluth <UNK> in this movie reminds me of my <UNK> tv production class where the <UNK> <UNK> had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were br br obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to <UNK> this wannabe comedy the jokes are <UNK> and <UNK> the delivery is painfully bad <UNK> the writing is simply <UNK> it is akin to a bob <UNK> show br br watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit post belushi br br i hated this movie and want my money back
<START> the sea is watching has been made from an original <UNK> kurosawa script and it is indeed a lush and warm film watching it will be a pleasure br br <UNK> <UNK> as director is certainly no equal to the old but <UNK> master particularly the mass scenes in the beginning of the film has some terrible acting but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable another thing that is missed here kurosawa always managed to let the characters be so much more then what they are actually showing and doing br br probably that was his magic on set while shooting and just maybe this script was not fully up to par yet br br maybe we just miss the eye of the master br br this is one lovely and sweet film but it is no kurosawa to expect that might well be very silly
<START> i don't really know whether cabin fever is supposed to be a joke or a film but as far as i know it's much closer to being a joke than anything else a few years ago the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre thus giving birth to the scream series a list was given in scream of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable and the characters in scream ended up doing exactly the same things which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different either full of irony towards the genre self <UNK> towards the film itself or at least different in their dramatic process than all the old films that <UNK> to the same tired <UNK> in seeing cabin fever alas many will see how unoriginal serious pretentious boring and even not scary some supposedly scary films are now even a few years later first of all this film lacks originality in a way few others do it has been said several times how little imagination horror directors have today <UNK> remakes of foreign sequels but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesn't seem to be an <UNK> to anything it seems to be simply a ripoff whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the film's story won't be once again we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early <UNK> who won't think <UNK> when placed in front of a problem will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it not much excitement there either for the <UNK> time in a horror film they are tempted to kiss make love and just basically have fun all sorts of things that don't really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously secondly this film is <UNK> serious every situation the characters are in every dialog every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of <UNK> will be <UNK> when some characters finally end up dying nothing in the way the film is directed written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisible never heard of before flesh eating virus no laughs please i won't even bring up the acting since there are no actors in this film the cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director <UNK> and this will strike whoever has seen a good horror film before the screenplay is absolutely empty nothing really happens some actions are repeated several times let's try to get help nothing makes sense either in the facts the psychology of the characters or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters in the end i will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it <UNK> of fake blood whether they are being <UNK> <UNK> from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds never were enough to scare an audience such major features as screenplay ideas and even cruelty are <UNK> for whoever claims to have shot something scary if i wasn't considering it to be a total failure i would agree to <UNK> that the film has one talent it is filthy disgusting to watch yet being <UNK> out and being scared are two very different feelings let it be known br br i would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first why not from the 60s the 70s the 80s films made by wes craven <UNK> <UNK> sam <UNK> stanley kubrick david lynch roger corman william <UNK> john carpenter it might not only give a good definition of what is scary or self <UNK> horror but also convince viewers that new isn't necessarily better a good example related to the film is the few tracks composer <UNK> <UNK> provided for this film even although they are <UNK> close to his previous compositions they are below anything he has ever done before
<START> i have grown up <UNK> over the <UNK> stories of the <UNK> in time chronicles my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large <UNK> reading a <UNK> in time and would think what an amazing movie this would make sadly enough that screenwriter failed changing characters throwing in lame humor and all out destroying the plot i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie but why can't you stay true to the book why must you change the way characters think and act for those of you who have not read the book pick it up find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild
<START> this film is really only bill <UNK> interpretation of religion there are several funny moments and some interesting points but don't go into this expecting an even handed discussion of religion this is what i consider to be the worst kind of documentary everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director rather than letting you make your own decision br br editing it's very chopped up inter spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to <UNK> the point the <UNK> barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing the only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what bill <UNK> wants them to say once someone <UNK> from the <UNK> according to <UNK> they get edited br br <UNK> they are meant to represent the absolute most <UNK> <UNK> from the tv <UNK> to the ultimate jewish stereotype to a truck stop <UNK> seriously a truck stop <UNK> he's picked the worst money <UNK> the heavy <UNK> and those who don't have the budget to say no to pick on and when he does get a good person to interview he edits the hell out of them br br stereotyping all <UNK> are portrayed as stereotypes especially hard hit are the muslims during the muslim segment he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before <UNK> them either himself or through editing in pieces with suicide <UNK> all muslims are portrayed as gun <UNK> <UNK> through the editing and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly br br ending the message at the end is incredibly heavy handed and while it is an interesting idea it's not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious <UNK> bill <UNK> explains himself while clips of destruction play in the <UNK> this literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world he also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid br br with the faults to the film it has some good points and the humor while very unfair is actually funny but know going in it is a very one sided view bill <UNK> view of religion he's not discovering anything he's telling you what he thinks br br 4 10 some good moments but heavy handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style
<START> i watched the show 10 years ago and loved it am now in possession of the dvd and was watching the series and waiting for scenes i knew were in the show when lucas confronts <UNK> in his house and realized it was missing all of a sudden i was watching the seduction without the lead up then i went on line to check out all the <UNK> of the stars and came across the comments about the shows being out of order thank you but there seems to be some conflict some comments state <UNK> number 19 then triangle 20 when another had them around the other way and also <UNK> boy 5 and dead to the world 6 were <UNK> as well can someone <UNK>
<START> the girl from <UNK> arrives in new york city knowing exactly what she wants to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire without losing her virginity with her <UNK> good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a <UNK> but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love br br jean harlow <UNK> in this excellent little comedy with her <UNK> hair gorgeous <UNK> she is a <UNK> but her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress she has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the hollywood <UNK> br br an excellent cast gives harlow fine support lionel barrymore as the <UNK> old <UNK> wise to <UNK> ways handsome <UNK> tone as his son smitten with love <UNK> <UNK> kelly stealing her scenes as <UNK> sidekick <UNK> alan <UNK> as a well mannered english lord elderly clara <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> secretary <UNK> hale hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies muscular <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> who catches kelly's <UNK> eye and lewis stone unforgettable in a small role as a <UNK> businessman br br it should be noted that this film was produced soon after hollywood's production code was <UNK> a comparison with red headed woman made two years earlier would be fascinating in which <UNK> character goes after the same ends but uses very different means
<START> i loved this movie it is rare to get a glimpse of post <UNK> vietnam and this movie sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and <UNK> did it i had no idea i'd be so affected by it what an amazing look at how alien vets feel it was tough to watch quite frankly we all understand the fighting and the apocalypse now type of drama but this is so so different what happens when they come back and try to live a life they can't it made me very aware of a large group of men that are <UNK> around lost in america not able to relate can't sleep can't have love affairs can't deal with normal society they feel totally apart this is a huge tragedy and one that isn't addressed enough yeah we've changed our attitude about vietnam vets we like them now but so what it doesn't seem to have made any difference to them it's too late so it was a great film but i cried a lot i have no other criticisms
<START> i'm 14 years old and i love this cartoon burt reynolds and dom <UNK> make a great pair this movie is really funny and i love the songs my favorite songs are you can't keep a good dog down and that song about sharing i think it's called what's mine is yours this was the last movie with <UNK> <UNK> who played the voice of anne marie my favorite character is charlie but i find <UNK> voice is so fun to hear although some scenes i actually found scary i still have a hard time watching the scene with charlie's dream and carface scares the crap out of me other characters like king <UNK> i found really funny the ending was adorable and was actually sad made me cry a little i give this movie 7 10
<START> my favorite movie genre is the western it's really the only movie genre that is of american origin and despite sergio <UNK> no one does them quite like americans br br right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is winchester 73 it was the first pairing and only black and white film of the <UNK> of director anthony mann and actor james stewart it was also a landmark film in which stewart <UNK> for a <UNK> of the <UNK> instead of a straight <UNK> from universal many such deals followed for players making them as rich as the <UNK> who employed them br br anthony mann up to this point had done mostly b pictures noir type stuff with no real budgets just before winchester 73 mann had done a fine western with robert taylor devil's <UNK> that never gets enough praise i'm sure james stewart must have seen it and decided mann was the person he decided to partner with br br in this film mann also developed a mini stock company the way john ford was legendary for besides stewart others in the cast like <UNK> mitchell steve <UNK> dan duryea john mcintire jay c <UNK> and rock hudson would appear in future mann films br br it's a simple plot james stewart is obsessed with finding a man named dutch henry brown and killing him why i won't say but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of james stewart on screen anthony mann reached into jimmy stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have br br the hate is <UNK> demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film after stewart and sidekick <UNK> mitchell are <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> played by will <UNK> because guns aren't carried in <UNK> dodge city there's a shooting contest for a winchester rifle in dodge city and the <UNK> favorite is dutch henry brown played with menace by stephen <UNK> stewart mitchell and <UNK> go into the saloon and stewart and <UNK> spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there look at the closeups of stewart and <UNK> they say more than 10 pages of dialog br br another character stewart runs into in the film is <UNK> johnny dean played by dan duryea who almost steals the film this may have been <UNK> finest moment on screen he's a <UNK> outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns br br another person stewart meets is shelley winters who's fiancé is <UNK> into a showdown by duryea and killed her best scenes are with duryea who's taken a fancy to her she plays for time until she can safely get away from him guess who she ultimately winds up with br br there are some wonderful performances in some small roles there ain't a sour note in the cast john mcintire as a <UNK> indian <UNK> jay c <UNK> as the <UNK> army sergeant and rock hudson got his first real notice as a young indian chief even john alexander best known as <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and old <UNK> has a brief but impressive role as the owner of a <UNK> post where both <UNK> and stewart stop at different times br br mann and stewart did eight films together five of them westerns and were ready to do a sixth western night passage when they <UNK> and mann walked off the set the end of a beautiful <UNK> that produced some quality films
<START> i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had <UNK> it as an over hyped over blown overly <UNK> piece of hollywood <UNK> and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i <UNK> my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real titanic the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought i'll give it a look see i didn't want to like it and i didn't i loved it what a great movie br br where to start first the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the <UNK> of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the <UNK> as news of the iceberg first <UNK> then the rising sense of panic you don't just watch it you really do feel it then the performances the lead performances from kate <UNK> as rose and <UNK> <UNK> as jack are excellent <UNK> being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girl poor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as <UNK> mother she was perfect as the <UNK> aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then the details i'm no expert on the sinking of the titanic but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of <UNK> the historical details accurately and then <UNK> them <UNK> around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine <UNK> performance of my heart goes on br br problems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just don't accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from <UNK> to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while the realities of the <UNK> of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the <UNK> passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty <UNK> br br a minor <UNK> though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive br br 9 10
<START> i like many die hard <UNK> or <UNK> i don't care suffered through seven seasons of star trek voyager dreaming of a better show when it was over <UNK> the end of deep space nine in 1999 <UNK> answered enterprise is fantastic fresh perspective <UNK> different characters stunning new visuals a pop song for the intro i was shocked i can't think of anything i didn't like sign me up for 10 seasons of this show star trek is back voyager nobody misses you keep on <UNK> br br
<START> the amazing mr williams stars melvyn douglas who did five films in 1939 one of which was <UNK> with garbo his co star was joan blondell <UNK> who also did five films that year three of which they made together douglas is lt williams and he and his co <UNK> are presented with a dead body and they must figure out what really happened viewers will recognize his co workers the actors clarence <UNK> donald <UNK> don <UNK> always played positions of authority <UNK> bank <UNK> policemen this who <UNK> has a flair of comedy to it the policemen are always throwing <UNK> at each other and even williams and his girlfriend are battling <UNK> some fun gags williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend there's a lot of fun stuff in here so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on don't want to give away any spoilers so you'll have to catch it on turner classic movies director alexander hall made mostly comedies and was reportedly engaged to lucy at some point
<START> if it were not for the oh so <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this b movie would not have been worth one <UNK> of my <UNK> <UNK> space in what low rent back lot warehouse was the supposed space <UNK> filmed in continuity people it's a basic principle in real movie making by night an alleged space <UNK> and by day night and day on a space station a warehouse people please the only thing i will <UNK> this movie for is the wardrobe <UNK> for continuously keeping <UNK> in those tight shape revealing outfits even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting into each day of filming the sci fi channel would have been better off showing <UNK> at least there would have been some real humor in watching something so unbelievable br br p s michael <UNK> please fire your agent <UNK> you are so much better of an actor to be even associated with this level of movie making
<START> run away from this movie even by b movie standards this movie is dreadful it is also <UNK> in it's theme the main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth <UNK> people who treat others with respect are losers <UNK> is a movie that speaks for the <UNK> a lot better than this movie see it instead br br no normal kid would do what <UNK> does state troopers do not work as they do in this film etc seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker with a heart of gold cliche <UNK> is a completely unsympathetic hooker who yes has had a terrible life however she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her br br usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for in this case there is none it is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters the acting is adequate by b movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting
<START> the cover of the box makes this movie look really good don't be fooled splatter university came out in 1984 which was the last good year for horror but this movie sucks the characters are so annoying only the teacher is cool there is like no plot to this movie who the hell would ever produce this waste of a film br br spoilers up ahead br br the teacher dies in this and it was a female we all know that we must have a female <UNK> if you're going to break the rules do it in a good horror flick not this waste
<START> this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen it is not funny it is not interesting and should not have been made
<START> this movie is about a <UNK> family but not just any dysfunctional family it is about the family of the father of our nation india although the film focuses mainly on the estranged relationship between <UNK> gandhi and his <UNK> son harilal gandhi it shows how the <UNK> had to kill m k gandhi how he had to sacrifice his family life in order to achieve our freedom every time <UNK> <UNK> gandhi and his son would try to get close the <UNK> would come between them this is a beautifully done film <UNK> <UNK> has proved himself to be a top actor he expressed emotions very naturally <UNK> <UNK> who mainly stars in plays <UNK> <UNK> lawyer in guru has portrayed gandhi wonderfully as a real human being unlike ben kingsley who made him look like a god <UNK> shah the girl from <UNK> wedding has also done a really good job of showing how <UNK> gandhi was torn between father and son this movie is touching and so is its soundtrack <UNK> <UNK> sung in a very unique manner i saw this movie just 3 hours ago it released in <UNK> a day earlier on the 2nd and when the movie was over there was pin drop silence and while <UNK> out of the theatre not one person pushed another can you imagine us indians not pushing not one there was a sacred silence
<START> this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema as indians we can proudly <UNK> that we have the biggest cinema industry however it also the worst br br how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on <UNK> out garbage take a look at russia iran china and latin america look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like <UNK> br br get real people no wonder the international community in general laughs at indian cinema
<START> this movie was made in <UNK> i think anyway the countryside is gorgeous the people who play the <UNK> folks were totally fascinating their <UNK> is awesome i got more into the native people the farm life and how heroic they were trying to hide brady from the evil nazis who where looking for these <UNK> they even sacrificed their life in several instances the young orphan <UNK> that brady befriends was a sweet kid you will marvel at the riding i think and the action of trying to <UNK> the nazis it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others ladies have <UNK> handy as you will be <UNK> at the end i own it and have watched it several times in other words not just a one time around flick its a keeper
<START> i saw this movie once in or close to its release year <UNK> years ago 1969 although i can now only remember bits of it i long to see it again the parts i remember rightly or wrongly include <UNK> gas in the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as a german spy offering some bloke sexual <UNK> in the back of an <UNK> truck to get military information from him the music score was especially memorable and emotion stirring in the league of gone with the wind and i would love to hear it again there must be some commercial or <UNK> reason why this movie is not available anyone know why i doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest
<START> from the opening dialog and scenes i knew i knew i was in for a train wreck didn't want to look but couldn't turn away if it weren't for the <UNK> eye candy of this film i would have given one star the fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low budget disaster money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to <UNK> br br if you were stuck out in the woods your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease other friends dying around you stranded in a strange place what would you do br br a run away from everyone and try your luck on your own b have sex with your friends girlfriend c take a hot bath to relax your <UNK> to include <UNK> your legs d bash in the head your childhood best friend and life long crush with a <UNK> e all of the above br br according to eli roth none of these answers are that far fetched in fact all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever the total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the <UNK> bin at your local rental store stay away stay far away
<START> what more could anyone want he's a history lesson foreign language <UNK> <UNK> representative and <UNK> to <UNK> dressed in a nice <UNK> <UNK> and heels i laughed so hard i left a <UNK> his <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> public school and done in several languages made the absolute finest stand up routine i have ever seen i think about it now years later when i see cake tea and cake or death and hear something translated into french the mouse is under the table the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch i like his versions of what jerry <UNK> could have been named before he settled on <UNK> <UNK> i really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy he has a lot to teach us and a wonderful way of telling it thanks for your time
<START> i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift who was made into a monster by society suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got but it was a happy surprise my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic the fact that the male lead isn't bad to look at surely helped and there was enough plot development action and even humor the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other's name had the whole <UNK> laughing to keep you entertained and invested in the story so in short not what i expected but a very good surprise indeed i'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd
<START> <UNK> <UNK> or black mask in english was a disappointment i was told that it was a sort of japanese version of the matrix imagine my disappointment the film was either badly dubbed or the soundtrack didn't time well with the film another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad there was very little thought put into the english version of this film and it appeals only to the senseless action genre not a film i would want to see again
<START> after being sent to prison for no less then 10 nor more then 40 years for being <UNK> with drugs and <UNK> to give up her <UNK> jackie <UNK> <UNK> of russ <UNK> <UNK> and beyond the valley of the dolls in her last film role has to get <UNK> to life in the big <UNK> house or at least try to in this early film by jonathan <UNK> due to it's <UNK> nature and sheer <UNK> i would also rank this as one of his best films right below silence of the <UNK> and stop making sense but so far above any of his other movies this minor classic is just campy sleazy and fun enough to be an amazingly good guilty pleasure and thankfully never once goes overboard into all out parody of the women in prison genre it almost washed out the <UNK> bad taste of the <UNK> preachy <UNK> from my mouth however the film is not without it's <UNK> the <UNK> show is a huge chore to sit through and goes on far too long <UNK> steele is sadly wasted among other small things but don't let those <UNK> stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie br br my grade b br br dvd extras 5 minute roger corman interview cast crew <UNK> original trailer and trailers for candy <UNK> <UNK> with nudity big bad mama 2 big doll house with nudity crazy mama br br eye candy <UNK> brown <UNK> <UNK> smith <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> collins ella reid <UNK> gold and some others all show skin
<START> lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids that depends on the kid this isn't a movie for a 2 6 year old it's more <UNK> toward the 8 years and older crowd i saw this movie when i was 10 i absolutely loved it at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes this movie deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact in this movie characters can die and be sent to hell this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are <UNK> their lives the good guys aren't always perfectly sweet and nice like other cartoons they have real motivations like revenge and greed but also compassion and friendship shows that things aren't always black and white br br excellent movie
<START> i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon <UNK> 1969 1972 or not old enough to appreciate them i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it br br i was a <UNK> at the time of apollo but i was old enough to understand what was going on the entire world followed the moon <UNK> our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch newspaper <UNK> screamed the latest goings on each day from launch to landing from <UNK> to moon <UNK> all the way to <UNK> in a <UNK> of languages in school some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv during apollo 13 the world <UNK> and held its collective breath as the men <UNK> home to an uncertain fate you couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was the world was truly one community br br now with a <UNK> of 30 odd years after the fact it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down we are left with our history books and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to prove it with a bunch of lies and made up facts while completely ignoring the <UNK> of evidence showing otherwise not to mention the proof that <UNK> in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully <UNK> and fantastic days
<START> i am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course eddie murphy i think this was his first movie since beverly hills cop so at the time he was hot considering that one made over two hundred million and it was r and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular i have never been a big eddie murphy fan so that is probably another reason i didn't care for it much at all this one has eddie as some sort of <UNK> of lost kids he must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril the plot is very bad but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects i had seen better stuff done in the 70's than some of the stuff this one offers ray <UNK> did better stuff still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of eddie unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the <UNK> of the lost <UNK> type scenes i guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect but to me it just did not work
<START> for whoever play games video games here did anybody notice that the <UNK> vice city mansion inside the game and some other things including weapons from the movie that are connected to this movie and this movie inspired the makers of the game <UNK> games to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best 80's movies out there i recommend this for anybody who still didn't see it 10 10 no questions asked
<START> actually this movie was not so bad it contains action comedy and excitement there are good actors in this film for instance doug <UNK> <UNK> from the green mile who plays <UNK> another well known actor is jamie kennedy from scream and three kings the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin who was pretty good and also funny but the one who most surprised me was david morse as edgar <UNK> he plays a different character than he usually does because in other films like the green mile indian runner the <UNK> or the <UNK> he plays a very sympathetic person and in bait the plays almost the opposite a man without any emotions which was nice to see the only really negative thing about this film are the several pictures of the world trade center which makes this film perhaps look a little dated overall i thought this was a pretty good little film
<START> this program is really overrated a detective like danny <UNK> hot headed character would have been transferred to the rubber gun squad years ago the whole squad is made up of <UNK> <UNK> who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007 every vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer unless it was another vietnam veteran there has only been one black murderer and he was put up to it by his white boss the only hispanic killer was a race <UNK> who killed another hispanic to frame a hispanic street kid for a crime that naturally two rich white kids committed what a bunch of propaganda hey screenwriters <UNK> and poor people commit murder too only on this show are most murderers upper class whites br br what's more the <UNK> of people in their 70s 80s and 90s for crimes they committed 50 60 years ago are a joke no real life da will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their <UNK> medical bills until they finally kick the state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor the <UNK> will just <UNK> them to <UNK> <UNK> and they won't serve a day the only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex nazis whose high profile <UNK> boost <UNK> careers
<START> the kids aged 7 to 14 got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year they all loved it kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently and we get a kick out of watching it with them br br it's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long and offers laughs for the adults too most enjoy it more than the first br br top quality production and an excellent cast led by christopher <UNK> as a superior george athletic energetic and wholly credible with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face well supported by the <UNK> christina <UNK> as the evil mother in law thomas <UNK> church as the evil jerk rival and everybody else this is fun
<START> 6 10 acting not great but some good acting br br 4 10 director makes some stupid decisions for this film br br 2 10 writer story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws br br 4 10 overall score for this movie br br don't waste your time with this film it's not worth it i gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty <UNK> stuff happens <UNK> not in good way because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes too many special effects slow motions and camera shakes and fast <UNK> it's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one in the first hour there is almost 50 50 dialogs and <UNK>
<START> this is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and <UNK> to get noticed that is it the dialogs are pathetic and the <UNK> of the sex scenes is absolutely absent the acting and the dialog are more suited for high school children yet the subject is intended for adult audiences it is a <UNK> and shallow movie it could have been way better if it had a story and more drama ah and on top of that one more thing why are inner monologues so <UNK> used makes it seem so cheap all in all an embarrassing movie for romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it i know the means are <UNK> but that is not always an excuse for a movie <UNK> as this one does and please start using some good actors in your movies and stop <UNK> them from musicians <UNK> <UNK> they can't act
<START> this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick <UNK> <UNK> plays the role of richard gere <UNK> that of olivier and <UNK> the perfect cheating wife role of lane they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses br br even then the movie has got the full <UNK> of <UNK> though it couldn't catch up with the original it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers where <UNK> showed a lot more skin than anyone <UNK> to show <UNK> did more roles like this and was even <UNK> the serial killer in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the <UNK> of the plot with the indian censors though the film bombed at the box office the actors got the <UNK> recognition in future the directors should be a little more careful in <UNK> a oscar nominated film br br all said this is not a family film so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family
<START> the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china however i found the combination of the <UNK> slow <UNK> and the general filming style so <UNK> as to be totally <UNK> particularly to a western audience at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart as they were filmed from such a distance two hours in and i was totally past caring as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema i couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into it begs the question if i disliked it who on earth would like it give me zhang <UNK> give me <UNK> <UNK> give me the work of just about any other chinese director i've ever seen this sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all i'd be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this <UNK>
<START> the woman in black 1989 is a tv adaptation of susan <UNK> modern classic ghost story published only a few years earlier than the film was made sadly this film has not been released on dvd and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs it's <UNK> is in direct contrast to it's popularity amongst those in the know about horror films the story revolves around events in a <UNK> community in the early 20th century where a young <UNK> is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died on her isolated <UNK> estate what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest the story is told in a subtle but <UNK> way never being self indulgent flashy or over <UNK> the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no nonsense approach but it's just what the story needs and why it works so well it's what you don't see that scares having said that there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual and it works to perfection i watched this film during the day and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later if you love being terrified do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black
<START> college student alex <UNK> nicholas <UNK> is plagued by nightmares of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> he dreams of cutting off his own hand spitting up a worm a <UNK> ripping open his chest and being <UNK> over an open fire after his friends see him <UNK> 6 feet over his bed a helpful occult obsessed teacher donna <UNK> suggests that they sneak into <UNK> to face his fears of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand br br the group become stranded <UNK> brother richard tom <UNK> becomes possessed and starts killing everyone toni basil of mickey fame shows up as the helpful ghost of sammy mitchell lead singer of the group <UNK> she teaches alex how to <UNK> out of his body and does a rock music dance <UNK> with repeat nightmare footage to pad out the running time all of the victims show up as <UNK> ghosts a la the <UNK> dunne character in an american werewolf in london the script is full of plot holes cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy good fx work and cool opening credits both by ernest d <UNK> are the only things gaining any merit basil and <UNK> whip it do some songs on the soundtrack br br score 2 out of 10
<START> i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority <UNK> rules this movie is <UNK> from the acting to the non realistic animation to the countless errors i was actually hoping that the <UNK> would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination can't <UNK> <UNK> without <UNK> the landing gear cannot be <UNK> unless you have electricity that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed the back <UNK> touched down and then the nose one broke off thus <UNK> the plane with both back <UNK> in the air how did the captain apply left and right <UNK> to <UNK> that weren't touching the ground did they forget the spoilers word to the director find out all you can about planes before attempting a plane movie sorry for the technical rant but i give this movie 1 10
<START> while the story is sweet and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy the <UNK> of the film and what makes it a masterpiece is the dream sequence it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music gershwin the engaging beauty of french <UNK> art kelly's enthralling choreography including his <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> really a separate genre with the most magnificent palette of color ever <UNK> for the set matching the <UNK> music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist
<START> <UNK> la <UNK> is still gerard <UNK> most popular part and it began the <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> in the french cinema in the 1955 1965 years it made gina <UNK> a star <UNK> and <UNK> would team up again in <UNK> <UNK> s <UNK> de <UNK> the same year br br <UNK> la <UNK> is completely mad sometimes <UNK> on absurd <UNK> <UNK> witty lines full of dark irony were probably influenced by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> often comes to the <UNK> these <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> and <UNK> de <UNK> when necessary joy of life and joy of death it becomes necessary to <UNK> men when the <UNK> <UNK> the survivors you won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me king louis <UNK> complains but no matter let's wait for the next time br br a voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride height of irony it's a genuine <UNK> who speaks br br christian <UNK> directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one <UNK> <UNK> br br remake in 2003 with vincent <UNK> and penelope <UNK> i have not seen it but i do not think it had to be made in the first place
<START> gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy film that made over 100 million but got <UNK> by most critics i personally thought this was a great film the story was believable and has <UNK> the greatest cast ever for this type of movie including 3 academy award winners nicolas cage robert duvall and the very hot <UNK> jolie other than the lame stunt at the end this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama my score is out of
<START> scott henderson alan curtis meets a mystery woman fay <UNK> in a bar and invites her to see a show with him she agrees on condition that they don't <UNK> any information about each other not even names sometimes these are the best kind of dates however when he returns to his apartment inspector burgess thomas <UNK> and his team are waiting for him scott's wife has been murdered his <UNK> is the mystery woman but no one can remember seeing her and as a result of this scott is sentenced to die for the murder of his wife his secretary kansas ella raines is not convinced of his guilt and sets out to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty br br this is a good film and the viewer is 100 behind the attempts of kansas to get to the truth we follow her through some memorable scenes <UNK> her pursuit of mac the bartender andrew <UNK> at night and the claustrophobic <UNK> where cliff the drummer elisha cook jr takes her to hang out drink and dance while he <UNK> with his friends this is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a stand out part of the film as everyone <UNK> intensely and <UNK> for the duration of the scene ella raines is good in the female lead role and thomas <UNK> makes a likable policeman alan curtis started well as the confused innocent man but once he is arrested his performance took a left turn as he became thoroughly unpleasant to kansas for no reason god knows why she stuck by him br br the film doesn't keep you guessing as to who the murderer is as we know from about halfway through the film but this doesn't matter in fact it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story as we will kansas to discover what is going on and then to get the hell out it's a good film with some great scenes but although elisha cook jr has a memorable role i just never like him in anything that i see him in someone hand me a neck tie
<START> <UNK> was the very first john <UNK> film i saw and i have to say that it was also the worst movie i had seen up to that point br br <UNK> group of talent included several people who i am sure worked for food and were willing to say the lines waters wrote every thing about the movie is terrible acting camera editing and the story about a woman played by 300 <UNK> <UNK> divine was purely absurd br br that said i have to recommend this film because it is very funny and you won't believe the crap that happens to poor <UNK> her son <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> unsuspecting women's feet at the <UNK> store her daughter is the <UNK> slut in town her husband is a <UNK> a hole of a <UNK> who does everything in his power to embarrass and <UNK> poor <UNK> br br <UNK> only friend is played by edith massey possibly the worst actress ever edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filming br br despite all of <UNK> <UNK> waters <UNK> up a fabulous hollywood ending and everyone who survives lives happily ever after
<START> i'll be blunt i'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who's not going to take any crap from anyone if any one of the cast members wanted to they could have just taken her out in a <UNK> it was entertaining on <UNK> <UNK> but don't rent the real version trust me have i ever <UNK> to you
<START> i thought this was a wonderful movie it touches every <UNK> of a human being the love in the film is very intense i thought it was <UNK> best performance to date great directing liked the editing music was great good use of flashback this is the kind of movie everyone should go see i hope people will get something wonderful from this overall excellent movie i think hollywood should make more movies with substance even action films can have a caring story i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about for me i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film the outside world was suspended for a moment it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world and with this me generation it was great to see something someone that cared about other people more than himself
<START> this movie was way over hyped a lot of the viewers who thought this was amazing must have been into the old school movies cause the whole movie is set in the past at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass but it just going basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie even with special effects you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying it's the greatest movie ever done it's just crap on a stick it also didn't help that the story line was <UNK> crappy i don't understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced and i also don't understand how actors actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this it's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print it will all be done on a computer this was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary i'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this whatever you do don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow
<START> contrary to most other comments about <UNK> on the imdb web site i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space br br in short this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30 second vignettes of different story lines from a dozen or so story lines at the audience made for great and clear viewing no sir it does not what does make for great viewing is total clarity <UNK> plots and story lines and <UNK> which have a beginning a middle and an end br br this kind of cinematic presentation akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant is pretentious and <UNK> in the extreme br br thank goodness then for the tv and dvd <UNK> of the hollywood and british film <UNK> of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers director and actors knew the value of clear story telling <UNK> and acting that meant something br br this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again
<START> the short that starts this film is the true footage of a guy named gary apparently it was taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station where gary works in the town of <UNK> gary is a little different he is an <UNK> and drives an old chevy named farrah after fawcett lo and behold the filmmaker gets a letter from gary some time later <UNK> him to return to <UNK> to get some footage of the local talent contest he has put together including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as olivia <UNK> dawn oh my the two shorts that follow are <UNK> story the same one you just witnessed only the first is portrayed by sean penn and the second by <UNK> glover titled the <UNK> kid if you are in the mood for making fun of someone this is definitely the film to watch i was <UNK> over with laughter through most of it especially <UNK> performance which could definitely stand on it's own when it was over i had to <UNK> the film to once again watch the real gary and all his shining idiocy although olivia was the focus i would have liked to have seen one of the <UNK> shorts take a <UNK> at <UNK> barry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> h was equally ridiculous
<START> well i am delighted to hear a <UNK> that this may finally be <UNK> on dvd when that will happen i don't know but i will grab it when it's released br br in my humble opinion this is errol <UNK> most entertaining film especially when gentleman jim <UNK> ring career begins in the film then it goes from a good film to a great one br br few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that reportedly this was <UNK> favorite role and i believe that you can just sense how much fun he was having here ward bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous john l sullivan bond too was never better br br there is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done too <UNK> family is fun to watch too as they carry on in the stands during <UNK> matches out of the <UNK> <UNK> family's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion br br and speaking of the conclusion <UNK> speech to corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film some mean spirited critics variety for example didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is <UNK> but duh most films are <UNK> like it or not and in this case it made for a nice story and nice ending in real life corbett was a very soft spoken true gentleman not anything like <UNK> portrayal but flynn still make him a good guy br br this is one of the more entertaining classic films i have ever watched and i eagerly wait for the dvd
<START> this film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot the entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other <UNK> along with her new partner another girl that's right they're lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through also unfortunately none of this is ever explained where exactly were they where did the demon come from how did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit the acting is terrible i think but it's hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it i give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap i would not recommend it it wasn't quite bad enough to be funny
<START> there are so many good things to say about this <UNK> movie br br <UNK> maybe in connections but not in <UNK> this is about the best of its genre that i have ever seen a grade a effort by universal the script is well done imaginative and without fault writing credits howard <UNK> original story douglas <UNK> story john <UNK> screenplay director <UNK> <UNK> handled the complex story and story locations very well no <UNK> on the loads of extras and locations i loved <UNK> <UNK> jimmy <UNK> mother in <UNK> a wonderful <UNK> the <UNK> lead frances drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her karloff husband lugosi likewise was correctly <UNK> i think this is the best part i remember seeing him in as i said there were so many good things the african discovery of the <UNK> <UNK> the melting of the stone <UNK> somewhat reminiscent of the ten little indians in and then there were none agatha christie the barry fitzgerald version the glowing of <UNK> in the dark <UNK> mother played by <UNK> <UNK> cooper with <UNK> and because of all these virtues i found myself believing in the science it portrayed i guess <UNK> the mark of a good piece of art
<START> winchester '73 is a great story and that's what i like about it it's not your everyday western it uses a rifle which passes hands from various characters as a <UNK> for telling the story about these people rock hudson plays an indian chief jimmy stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength and <UNK> winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west it's important to note for those politically correct types they kill a lot of indians in this movie without <UNK> by today's standards it's still pretty violent but it's a great story and worth watching enjoy
<START> i was not expecting much going in to this but still came away disappointed this was my least favorite <UNK> production i have seen i thought it was supposed to be a comedy but i only <UNK> at 3 or 4 jokes is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating <UNK> and falling down over and over what was up with the janitor in heaven scene fred <UNK> has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest <UNK> but this did not work they must have spent all the budget on getting known actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball <UNK> through a basket i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie
<START> rodney <UNK> isn't the main character of this movie he's barely in it most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny jokes one running gag is that a character is named jerk off there are also lots of <UNK> jokes where the punch line is someone has an <UNK> this movie is as funny as <UNK> <UNK> british accent is convincing br br this movie started off like a weak action movie five minutes of back story and then <UNK> unfunny jokes but aside from the terrible writing the movie is also poorly directed and the acting is terrible also this movie does the old bad comedy cliché of having lots of well known b movie actors <UNK> williams gilbert <UNK> randy quaid and phil la <UNK> these are just some of the people that spend more time on the screen than rodney even though he's billed as the main character don't be surprised to find this movie at a drug store selling for five bucks even that is too much
<START> first animated feature film from ireland is also one of the best animated films i've ever seen its a real <UNK> and all story that is unlike any of the other oscar <UNK> and any other film from this year or any other year br br the plot of the film has the <UNK> of kells a village in ireland building a wall around his town to prevent the <UNK> from destroying the town should they ever attack his nephew <UNK> is a young monk who does the best he can but meets the <UNK> of his uncle by doing things in his own time when a legendary <UNK> <UNK> arrives from a destroyed monastery <UNK> <UNK> towards him and his warm personality much to his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> offers to teach <UNK> how to <UNK> in order to help <UNK> work on his great book saved from his destroyed monastery brendan goes out into the forest to get material to make <UNK> while outside the walls he meets ashley a forest spirit with whom he develops a friendship unfortunately the <UNK> finds out that he went outside the wall and there is hell to pay but lurking in the distance are the <UNK> br br forget what you think you know about this film you're wrong even what i've explained doesn't do this film justice its a simple story with so much more going on this is a wonderful movie about trying to find your way in the world over coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside of the walls as the film says the world is a dangerous place and doesn't <UNK> to be even if you build walls br br its a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life including the darkness there is death and destruction and joy and happiness its not sugar <UNK> people die monsters <UNK> it freaked out some of the kids but in the end there is hope frankly the darkness in this film is completely unlike anything in any recent american film forget the sadness in a pixar film this is the real thing and its refreshing and it shows how <UNK> even pixar has become br br its a <UNK> <UNK> esquire samurai jack animated film who's look is actually based upon the the <UNK> art of the period its a film that looks unlike any other here again is another film that takes the movie frame and uses it in every way possible the images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary book of kells its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life br br director <UNK> moore has fashioned a film that is a masterpiece i can't say more than that its a masterpiece its one of the best animated films i've ever run across
<START> this is a funny film it has all the usual disney <UNK> music great range of characters story appeal <UNK> with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say <UNK> and price of egypt br br the characters work really well and have a strong appeal and the humour is aimed at a wide level which <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the movie is also presented in superb <UNK> format which adds to the cinema experience br br call me crazy but i have seen the film three times and i intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend many <UNK> have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed i work in a <UNK> and i can honestly say that no one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction br br see it and don't be put off because it is animated you are sure to enjoy this movie and make sure you stay for the end credits the <UNK> and out takes at the end are the funniest part of the film which is packed with laughs throughout

<START> this is indeed a god adaptation of jane <UNK> novel compared with the american version with <UNK> paltrow the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book but the acting was awful besides kate beckinsale who i believe was a true <UNK> of the emma in the book all the other actors were trying too hard mark strong was not the gentleman he was supposed to be he was often rude and offensive had no feeling whatsoever and throughout the entire film you could not see his love growing for emma at all this had a terrible effect on kate beckinsale who seemed to be trying to <UNK> her leading role as well as her <UNK> moreover there was no chemistry between the entire cast <UNK> smith played by samantha <UNK> seemed to have no real <UNK> to mr <UNK> played by dominic <UNK> therefore she did not seem as <UNK> as she was portrayed in the book the settings of the film are also too poor the costumes are even more so i would have imagined emma <UNK> to dress in a more <UNK> and elegant way that she does here the ending is also too long it is good that it resembles the <UNK> ending but it is a killer ending for a film and again i can see no feeling of happiness in the face of mr knightley to conclude i believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book but with poor actors it seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all i would prefer to see the lighter version with paltrow and northam even if it is clear that it was made to be a blockbuster than to watch these actors <UNK> the good olivia williams and the better kate beckinsale ruin the entire script
<START> i've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is life sometimes has boring <UNK> no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending a river runs through it is the perfect name for this film and norman <UNK> novel life <UNK> and flows like a river and it has it's rough spots but it is a wonderful trip br br robert redford brings a lot to the film his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly as a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes as for the acting craig <UNK> and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers i don't know quite how to describe tom <UNK> and brenda <UNK> performances except that they truly feel real a river runs through it is a wonderful film br br 8 6 out of 10
<START> the comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable those attracted to the <UNK> and depth of <UNK> will be slightly horrified to discover a cut and <UNK> musical in the american style awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable song and dance numbers gene kelly's french accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was <UNK> as you'll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in <UNK> the translation of the french for subtitled versions as well leaves something to be desired although this can't be attributed to <UNK> the film also has several self aware moments that come off a wee <UNK> such as references in songs to <UNK> himself and the costumes well the tight pants white boots combination and the <UNK> unnatural colors reminds one of an austin powers film br br but <UNK> does reward the viewer with <UNK> to <UNK> note for instance the <UNK> carried by <UNK> in his departure from <UNK> this is the same <UNK> carried by guy in his departure from <UNK> also note the convenient brunette of resolution madeleine in <UNK> and <UNK> in young girls br br generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of <UNK> save the floating <UNK> scene or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in <UNK> script should probably pass this one b y those looking for a french version of a thin '60s american musical will be quite happy
<START> the three main characters are very well portrayed especially <UNK> by rock musician turned into first time actor <UNK> <UNK> he is extremely convincing as the lower class <UNK> <UNK> the film shows very well the <UNK> effect of getting involved in ever more shady business the contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes how everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition 9 9 5 out of 10
<START> this movie is about sexual obsession bette davis plays mildred this is a woman who men are drawn to not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual <UNK> now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going <UNK> eyes over her she works as a waitress in a coffee shop she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a <UNK> it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her one day phillip a club <UNK> failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes <UNK> the moment he sees her he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it he dreams about her like she is a angel but she is no angel he is constantly thinking about her his <UNK> school <UNK> are even failing so what the <UNK> is too good he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy she always lets phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time he is heart broken but he meets another woman they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo mildred does comes back with a baby and <UNK> phillip takes her in again but she starts going out with a friend of his the light <UNK> comes on a little and he kicks her out she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his <UNK> money up oh we have a club foot that he has problems about even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to <UNK> up about it he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred well he has no school <UNK> can't find a job finally sally and her dad takes him in not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again she has <UNK> meanwhile he is still leading sally down the <UNK> path about marriage and he takes a job on a <UNK> finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally i wished she told him to stuff it now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points but i feel phillip was the bad guy yes mildred is a <UNK> but he knows it and he keeps coming back mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as <UNK> i guess the sex wasn't as good but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he <UNK> to do about baby apparently the <UNK> name he laughs is off he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy <UNK> father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old <UNK> philip doesn't seem to <UNK> his feelings either men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as <UNK> yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred
<START> although there are some snippets in this 4 part documentary <UNK> at the necessity for <UNK> drug law <UNK> these are not very well developed in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a <UNK> for which the only imaginable solution is <UNK> of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs br br although this program as a whole leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a <UNK> exercise and a waste of money and for that it deserves some praise almost nothing in this documentary <UNK> the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you if asked they think the drug war is designed to solve for example while many minutes are spent on the <UNK> in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80's at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to <UNK> crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to <UNK> their <UNK> and business <UNK> in <UNK> of law forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence the drugs themselves seem to take the <UNK> of the blame inexplicably alcohol <UNK> the violence that <UNK> and the subsequent <UNK> of <UNK> is totally ignored by this program br br this program will help to <UNK> ridiculous stereotypes of drug users and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very <UNK> drug war the possibility of <UNK> drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems but not all users do their drugs in excess just like not all alcohol users are <UNK> br br if you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be <UNK> and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government for mostly very <UNK> political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science has decided to totally <UNK> whose users it has decided to not so <UNK> <UNK> war against just forget about it none of that is in here br br on the other hand this is hardly in the category of anti drug propaganda it is mostly an interesting <UNK> presented history of drugs in 20th century united states like marijuana <UNK> heroin cocaine <UNK> and <UNK> but there is a significant element of various people's points of view with regard to drug laws and most but not all of that is not very thoughtful or well informed and <UNK> in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana br br the criminal justice system along with its often harsh life ruining <UNK> is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately there's an <UNK> in this nation of an as yet <UNK> disease whose primary <UNK> are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs a lack of compassion for fellow humans a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not <UNK> <UNK> perhaps a <UNK> interest in the growth of the prison <UNK> industry and a horrid <UNK> with regard to human dignity it's morally wrong to kidnap or <UNK> people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so and the mere possession of an <UNK> selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason this is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs yet this program ignores it br br so in sum the parts of this program that <UNK> present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining but when it comes to presenting a rational non radical point of view with regard to drug policy and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully <UNK> drugs into happy and successful lives it's pretty disappointing
<START> adrian has just gone out of the asylum being rich and with no parents his life seems empty one day he meets <UNK> a poor boy whom mother is prostitute desperate for <UNK> some money <UNK> helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents this is a movie from a new director and it is perfectly clear in most of the film scenes not correctly directed dialogues a little forced some <UNK> in the script anyway the ending is unexpectedly well done well just a little and that saves a little the film actors are known and with great quality nevertheless they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting all of them have done better papers in other film the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends of course there are lots of worse films but sure there are many many better ones
<START> before i begin i want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved including <UNK> who indeed deserves his nomination it is highly entertaining and taken in the right context as a work of fiction it is a very good movie for that i give it the two stars br br however rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character dr nicholas <UNK> is a complete invention of fiction rather it presents this character into a real historical setting and allows the <UNK> viewer to assume he was in fact real and what they are seeing is the truth i have no problem with the <UNK> of fact and fiction but to do so in such a <UNK> matter is in a word <UNK> br br there can be no doubt that africa along with most third world countries is <UNK> with human misery and suffering hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film but hollywood also has its eye toward making money the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary br br but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much at the end of the day they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming see we told you it was bad the <UNK> example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay <UNK> <UNK> second wife whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity in the film we see that her limbs have been severed and <UNK> in reverse arms for legs and vice versa this is the director making sure you understand that <UNK> is as the <UNK> say <UNK> bad but watching the documentary we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true br br so what they just make up these things why because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence that's why they don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves look that she was murdered and <UNK> is in itself enough for us to conclude that <UNK> was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media we don't need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to <UNK> that and this is just the tip of the iceberg what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character <UNK> is himself fictional there was no young scottish doctor taken under <UNK> wing as such <UNK> is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb <UNK> understand the african world the producers seem to thing we won't be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it ironically even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of <UNK> and his regime but instead an exploitative thriller about a white <UNK> coming to africa for all the wrong reasons making several horrible mistakes and then redeeming himself even at the cost of three other innocent lives honestly i have to say it is nearly <UNK> to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs <UNK> was the result of a <UNK> with a fictional scottish doctor it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment i really wish hollywood would stop <UNK> us around for our money i first realized its <UNK> to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind ron howard and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sweet adaptation of the life of john <UNK> which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just can't get enough of the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these <UNK> for years and viewers who are predictably and understandably too lazy or <UNK> to investigate for themselves buy these fake <UNK> hook line and <UNK> br br look i'm certainly not suggesting <UNK> is being turned into a villain he wasn't my point is with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man why must hollywood then go to such fictional <UNK> why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films why can they not trust us to think for ourselves can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves i urge all who continue to watch hollywood's <UNK> true movies to do yourself the favor of always investigating for yourself and to never assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth
<START> like all <UNK> movies this is a joke the way the dinosaurs move reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls because they cannot be any <UNK> or more fake looking than they were br br the plot had no sense whatsoever i mean first they're on a bus then in a warehouse then all of a sudden they're on a boat and let's be serious does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van or on a ship i thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals and now they can fit on a moving van it sounds stupid even when you think about it br br the only reason for which i gave this a 3 is because it's still entertaining i found it better than the first one haven't watched the second yet just don't rent it i saw it on tv and it's a good thing i did because i wouldn't have wanted to waste money renting it
<START> after citizen kane in 1941 hollywood executives turned their <UNK> <UNK> backs on the great orson welles with the exception of kane welles lost all creative control on magnificent <UNK> journey into fear and many other films to come welles was an innovative and creative genius the most unconventional of filmmakers when hollywood was in need of a few more the lady from shanghai is yet another example of the misunderstood view of welles' films at the time a movie that seems a bit choppy and non <UNK> it has a conventional 1940's premise told in a most unconventional way and i am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor it is now legend that columbia <UNK> harry <UNK> stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about in <UNK> many old <UNK> that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story telling of orson welles and the lady from shanghai is only nearly great because of their <UNK> br br beside being arguably the greatest director of all time welles was also quite a performer as an actor at 25 we all know what he did as charles foster kane perhaps the most famous character in film history here he <UNK> a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence something unfamiliar to those familiar with welles other great work instead of a slick wise tongue he speaks with a rough irish <UNK> rita hayworth his <UNK> married wife at the time plays an <UNK> married wife of a lawyer who puts welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and <UNK> he is a large <UNK> who may have even murdered a man but the real mystery lies in the relationship between hayworth with stunning blonde hair and crippled <UNK> everett sloane mr <UNK> from citizen kane a creepy partner of <UNK> is along for the <UNK> around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has welles' michael o'hara head spinning welles <UNK> the picture as o'hara but things are still unclear throughout see for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what's up br br an <UNK> strange courtroom sequence centers around o'hara with sloane defending him it is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods including sloane cross <UNK> himself i didn't really laugh here because the film <UNK> at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway up to this point the cinematography is great some scenes are shot with craft and skill <UNK> love scene but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us the audience in reportedly the court scene was re shot against welles' <UNK> 10 closeups of hayworth were ordered and a <UNK> song sung by the <UNK> was thrown in at <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> score <UNK> welles who once again was left out of the editing process thank welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour de force ending that will always be <UNK> the so called hall of mirrors scene brings buffs back time and time again rightfully so br br it must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of <UNK> up some confusing ideas presented the crash of the mirrors represents <UNK> <UNK> and the crazy house itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration it seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed crazy twisted and turned like a <UNK> painting this is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the <UNK> top 100 then again 3 or 4 more of orson welles films may have made all collective best of lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic br br note look for the <UNK> players that are so prominent in welles pictures they pop up all over rating 8 of 10
<START> apparently there's a very good reason why i never heard about dr <UNK> before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and <UNK> decided to give it a chance that reason is it sucks it's a very pointless dull <UNK> and totally <UNK> horror comedy parody actually to be honest i'm not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late 80's horror effort in the year <UNK> at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences dr elliot <UNK> needs exactly three women  no more no less  to <UNK> his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed she's only just a living head left now but the stupid body <UNK> only provide male <UNK> so when dr <UNK> yells out i need three female bodies to bring back my wife his words aren't even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females and one really annoying nerdy kid with car trouble show up at his <UNK> why doesn't that ever happen to me i need a bunch of sexy <UNK> women to fill up my empty <UNK>  see nothing anyway the good doctor sees his wish <UNK> but unfortunately  for science that is  he develops sympathy for one of the three girls dr <UNK> is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of re animator and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic like a severed head talking one liners it's easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere as it doesn't appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre the funniest character is undoubtedly the loud speaking female grave <UNK> ruby depicted by the anti <UNK> anne <UNK> 80's horror buffs will certainly remember her from wes craven's deadly friend where she played the nasty old <UNK> neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball dr <UNK> supposedly takes place in the early <UNK> but there are hardly any attempts to re create the atmosphere of that era except maybe for some <UNK> dr <UNK> laboratory is a quite clichéd 80's set piece with all sorts of <UNK> <UNK> and test <UNK> full of <UNK> colors
<START> this has to be one of the best if not the best film i have seen for a very very long time had enough action to satisfy an fan and yet the plot was very good i really enjoyed the film and had me hooked from start to finish br br added blood and gore in there but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film and even had a tear <UNK> ending for many people i should think br br it is a must watch for anyone seen many reviews <UNK> the film but to be fair most the films that get bad reviews turn out to be some of the best this proves it once again br br rent this film buy this film just go out and watch this film you will not be disappointed
<START> i have to start off by <UNK> because i thought the first 75 80 of this film was hilarious it's mostly because of brad <UNK> performance spot on br br the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie the atmosphere was perfect in all respects i'm not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever br br brutal honest gritty all good words to describe this movie br br i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind <UNK> violence isn't explained it is explained but they thankfully don't have to go into graphic detail to get their point across br br overall i gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie underrated
<START> i've got a question for those who thought of this idea why what made them think to make a second movie of this if memory serves didn't cinderella end with they all lived happily ever after i'm pretty sure it did or it was implied wait a minute if they all lived happily ever after how could there be a sequel unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history there couldn't be a sequel i mean sure they could have cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours but why a movie that ends in happily ever after can not have a sequel if it does then they don't live happily ever after <UNK> got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending why that's not right it's evil that's my final word on the matter
<START> legend of <UNK> is one of those little known games that people either love or hate some people claim it's far too similar to other games namely the final fantasy series which is understandable since it was originally intended to be <UNK> equivalent of final fantasy honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that as i'm not very familiar with the <UNK> games br br i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful <UNK> form but every time you attack you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by <UNK> buttons at the correct time not only that sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button <UNK> if you don't want to attack you can always guard which not only cuts any damage taken in half but raises your hit points without the use of healing <UNK> br br the <UNK> are quite well done about the same quality as final fantasy <UNK> however the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard they're nice but they could have been and honestly should have been better the translation as well leaves something to be desired not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions but there are also some <UNK> mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass br br another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters one dies and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves while the death of the one character is often said to have no point it makes you realize early on that the characters while heroes are still just as mortal as the next person the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their <UNK> so the transition game play wise is fairly smooth perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest <UNK> she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of <UNK> pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration while you can use her in your party she is insanely weak i don't even know what her <UNK> powers are like as i disliked her so much i never used her the character rose by contrast is probably my favorite female character in any game ever she's no <UNK> and some of her <UNK> magic is extremely useful <UNK> is quite strong as well while sometimes being an annoying <UNK> brat br br the character <UNK> were as most are inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever and didn't give much thought to the actual <UNK> of the outfits seriously no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters but i will give them props as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries br br i can't comment much on the plot as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself or my <UNK> style br br all in all it's a very enjoyable game it has its flaws but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just <UNK> buttons and killing monsters
<START> <UNK> wants to be <UNK> for a dream for <UNK> <UNK> but it comes across as a hard r rated <UNK> madness br br yes drugs are bad and <UNK> is horribly <UNK> as an addiction and how it destroys people families and <UNK> but these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eye rolling plot won't teach that lesson to anyone br br while writer director star matt farnsworth has some charisma on screen his partner diane foster plays a <UNK> silly wide eyed innocent <UNK> by <UNK> was already <UNK> by susan sarandon in the rocky horror picture show i really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through it wasn't until the end of the film that i realized i was supposed to think these two were recent high school <UNK> to explain some of their <UNK> as we are <UNK> by their school photos but if so they even looked older than the folks on the o c while they have good chemistry on screen they are a pale imitation of a <UNK> type couple br br the guest stars are badly used michael t <UNK> who was so good in tv's the <UNK> is completely ludicrous as a corrupt <UNK> officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film <UNK> arquette has to be even <UNK> than she rolled around for david <UNK> as a very low rent <UNK> soprano john savage even has to mouth the old baby <UNK> excuses about i did pot but this is worse a <UNK> chick shows up with the odd explanation that she's a stripper from des <UNK> the obligatory latino drug dealer appears in <UNK> br br with a limited budget the interior view of <UNK> use is portrayed quite vividly with quite scary hallucinations we certainly see them go crazy br br while the <UNK> locations are used very well including an amusing scene of a <UNK> gas robbery the accents and church references are <UNK> southern <UNK> guns seem to be used by law <UNK> and law breaking citizens here more than in any inner city drug dealing movie br br the songs of <UNK> best known <UNK> greg brown are used throughout but oddly are not listed in the credits i hope they were used with <UNK> br br i caught this at its commercial run in nyc because i missed it at the <UNK> film festival where it got considerable and inexplicable buzz
<START> there are no spoilers here because there is no plot to spoil <UNK> <UNK> is living proof a face can make a living acting no talent required the only bright spot are a few really good one liners delivered very nicely by alice <UNK> but then again she is alice <UNK> her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how <UNK> dangerous these odd creatures can be she is <UNK> creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery the screenplay writers must have been <UNK> when they <UNK> this script it has major continuity problems superficial stereotypical characters horror formula writing and simply falls short of making any sense what so ever the creatures while they have neat skills like going dim the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored br br don't waste any time on this one
<START> zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment it delivers a message about its <UNK> subject school shootings <UNK> the lives of two friends andre and cal leading up to an attack on their high school br br whilst the movie started in somewhat <UNK> fashion an <UNK> <UNK> of the coming attack in amateurish teenage style followed by some brief encounters with the boys families it is not long before we are down to business with the boys showing us their collection of guns their <UNK> love of them their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fantasies and even in a controversial scene how to build <UNK> bombs br br so what is the movie trying to say what is really <UNK> these soon to be killers it seems hard to really <UNK> they certainly do not come across as cold blooded <UNK> yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality this brings me to what i feel is the genius in part of zero day cal and andre talk constantly about how much they are on a different level how above the rest of us they are and how they will <UNK> us all behind ' like the <UNK> killers they truly feel superior like <UNK> <UNK> sentiment cal and <UNK> value system seems to have been born out of <UNK> from their society yet we are given only glimpses of this an expression of hatred for a popular <UNK> for example so where is the motivation what i feel is that <UNK> portrayed two individuals desperate to make a statement of <UNK> a gesture of their power yet who have no reasonable <UNK> for it hence they turn to mass murder and the kind of which that will garner them more attention than they could ever realise this is why in part school <UNK> seem able to carry out atrocious acts despite coming from good stable loving homes the murder is part of a fantasy cal and andre are totally lost in their fantasy they almost fail to see the reality of their actions they turn fantasy into tragedy br br what is secondly most enthralling about this film is the character development and the unique <UNK> cal and andre have on each other andre is throughout the film overtly the leader of the two <UNK> embrace of his <UNK> and <UNK> seem somewhat forced andre is uptight andre is intense and serious he completely <UNK> others except for his family he is <UNK> and precise about everything he does and for a while appears the prime <UNK> in the plot to attack the school yet he is likable in his own way he does not embrace teenage nonsense and in part we feel compelled to agree with him yet these moments are <UNK> by <UNK> fleeting gestures of violence towards us the audience treating us as both <UNK> and potential victim cal on the other hand seems more relaxed than andre more accepting of reality yet he is in his own way <UNK> we have many personal moments of <UNK> with <UNK> video diary scenes when he is alone and apart from andre cal seems to be struggling with his own personal demons and using their plan to <UNK> himself of them andre is jealous of cal going to the prom with an old friend he wants cal all to himself cal <UNK> andre and encourages him for the first time in his life andre seems to have found someone who believes in him and who <UNK> him he cannot lose it whilst cal has found someone offering him a way out br br the movie certainly picks up pace and <UNK> as it <UNK> its grim conclusion there is an excellent moment when cal <UNK> the high school prom suddenly the star of the movie becomes shy and <UNK> not at all at ease with his peers yet we are inclined to feel more connection with cal than with the <UNK> <UNK> crowd screaming juvenile <UNK> whilst drinking heavily in their <UNK> theirs is an episode all too common and <UNK> we do not want to relate to them when it is over and cal is back with andre <UNK> preparing one of their final videos we like the characters feel once again at ease safe in the fantasy world they created we feel like <UNK> the masses as they have br br the <UNK> scene is superb the final video sees andre and cal <UNK> themselves in their car just moments before attacking it is all too real and truly creates a sense of impending doom by know we know cal and andre and are <UNK> they are about to actually do it with a kind of morbid fascination we are also <UNK> the films <UNK> br br the massacre shot in <UNK> fashion is at times shocking and whilst it was certainly the perfect choice to depict the massacre if we were going to it is not void of flaws what is most significant is the sudden radical change of perception we have of cal and andre looking at them in the this person suddenly they are the <UNK> killers we knew they would become yet refused to acknowledge that they would it is violent and real our heroes have become monsters and the reality of their fantasy is a terrible tragedy which costs them everything br br the final scene shows a group of teens filming themselves burning the crosses <UNK> for andre and cal in disgust that they have been <UNK> having known andre and cal we can only feel almost a sadness that they are actually gone forever and that they certainly did not win anything br br zero day is a must see for anyone interested in these violent acts <UNK> by the media it is a character study well worth experiencing
<START> it begins on a nice note only to <UNK> quickly and let down expectations br br mac akshay kumar and <UNK> john abraham characters are not properly built before <UNK> boss decides to <UNK> him with three air <UNK> rest of the drama is about how mac sam and uncle <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deal with situations which at times seem forced br br about the cast <UNK> <UNK> is a very talented actor i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook akshay kumar is tolerable john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture <UNK> <UNK> is the only saving grace in the movie br br the second half of the movie is funny at times but in all a dud songs are boring and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy
<START> this wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the spaghetti western so exciting and fun great music by one of the few if not the only female composer to work in the genre nora <UNK> exciting action sequences and very vicious ones for the day and beautiful scenery and sets all in <UNK> spain of course it also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it the actors do marvelous jobs with truly standout performances from lawrence <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the most vital role for a female in a spaghetti western outside of <UNK> in <UNK> once upon a time in the west without <UNK> any spoilers let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film i have ever seen
<START> i'm writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie whilst it's not the worst i've seen it certainly isn't good br br a weak script weak actors and weak directing even if they can't afford big name cast would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance the story was a cliché and poorly scripted the special effects were minimal the suspense tricks employed <UNK> here were hard to swallow br br to be fair dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of <UNK> episodes but not quite on par with quality movies yet dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movie in the genre even if it's a poorly made one as for anyone else time should be spent on something more valuable which should be extremely easy
<START> having watched this film strictly on the strength of <UNK> ratings i was most pleasantly surprised although clearly low budget it bears the signs of clever <UNK> for example when julia wakes in the strange house and looks out the window i found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced with an exterior shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location and lo and behold the next scene was exactly that last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff at the <UNK> edge there are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very enjoyable thriller <UNK> viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed br br as to the performances george <UNK> is his usual creepy self barely maintaining his <UNK> while suggesting a capacity for <UNK> violence nina <UNK> was surprisingly good as the no nonsense working girl who's not about to submit without a fight but dame may witty oh boy she even had me <UNK> my own eyes and believing she could get away with her evil schemes br br this a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed
<START> this recreation of the infamous 1959 murders in kansas based on the capote book is <UNK> filmed by brooks and cinematographer hall in black and white giving it a documentary feel there are good performances from blake and wilson as the killers and forsythe as a cop who <UNK> them the scenes leading up to the murders filmed at the actual house where the crime occurred with a soundtrack of <UNK> winds are quite intense and chilling brooks directs with a lot of <UNK> and uses several interesting transitions between scenes the only complaint is that it is a bit overlong with the denouement dragged out and somewhat preachy
<START> at least among those movies with 100 votes or more nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen brenda <UNK> nominated for best actress in a leading role nominated for best picture i always disagree with many of the oscar picks but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be <UNK> by the academy the writing and acting were both horrible <UNK> <UNK> in particular was one of the worst i've ever seen and probably the most over rated acting performance of all time awful movie not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it including hbo where i saw it i am only thankful i didn't actually pay to see one of the most over rated movies of all time
<START> as the faux russian scientist says two thirds of the way into the movie i came for the science this pretty much sums up the reason i watched this movie anything that involves a half man half hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious <UNK> investigation on the part of an <UNK> aspiring scientist or as they say in the <UNK> my <UNK> brother had the remote and the rest is history to say that the special effects were bad would be a <UNK> to the field of special effects this is 2005 it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy <UNK> background yeah this was charming and state of the art when hitchcock was filming the birds but in 2005 it just looks low budget spare me the cheap attempt at sci fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief br br however having seriously <UNK> the overall concept of this film let me tell you again that as sad as it may sound this is probably worth your time if nothing else it is a tour de force of bad sci fi worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a <UNK> course for those who have seen a few movies in their day br br the crazy <UNK> mad scientist with a hammerhead <UNK> who thinks it is a good idea to <UNK> <UNK> of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind but also the ability of b movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines br br this film also pretty much <UNK> one of my longtime bad movie <UNK> bad guys always wear <UNK> br br if this weren't 2005 i would be <UNK> on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the cold war i mean you might as well have khan on the bridge of a <UNK> bird of prey <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> ear br br one of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the <UNK> insists that the charlton heston <UNK> wait for tom as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground the thing is tom is wasting the bad <UNK> guys with his never ending banana clip attached to his <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> terms br br as the mad scientist says near the end of the film my goal is to <UNK> the human species suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a <UNK> of <UNK> the faint <UNK> references <UNK> by the mad scientist as he <UNK> the female protagonist to be <UNK> with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about
<START> if you're a fan of mystery science theater <UNK> attack of the giant <UNK> or <UNK> survival island this movie might be for you br br i live in <UNK> and i didn't even know of this movie's existence until the day prior to its release when the advertising company <UNK> and <UNK> music row with dozens of <UNK> and <UNK> it barely lasted two weeks in theaters anyway br br bad acting bad writing and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film for starters the names are a bit much bo price angel and <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the cue cards off camera <UNK> character rapidly transitions from her city <UNK> ways to a <UNK> <UNK> into southern <UNK> after two days on the ranch her wardrobe goes from <UNK> to a female version of <UNK> in fact in the final scene their outfits are identical making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called in sick br br the audio is inconsistent perhaps the most noticeable example is when toby decides to go for a swim and his voice suddenly sounds like he's shouting in a <UNK> br br there's never quite enough explanation or character development to suffice what happens on screen overacting <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> best describes the actors' interpretation and direction of the terrible script br br this movie is best enjoyed after <UNK> a couple of alcoholic <UNK> and in the company of your <UNK> friends but that's not saying much
<START> there's no way to confront <UNK> <UNK> from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions you'd use for other movies this is because it isn't a movie it's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film what we see are not the <UNK> of a plot but rather a sequence of events that we don't see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends we we see is our imagination of people that are <UNK> to us no one we know but we've <UNK> heard of them in a book or on tv or somewhere so what do we see events we see people arguing driving and inevitably escaping only the escape is from something <UNK> it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though <UNK> or human nature set in late 1960s los angeles our players act against and in response to the self inflicted <UNK> of modern existence these creatures are effectively blank <UNK> that can display any <UNK> we can imagine if we desire although the actions taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible the characters are not themselves criminals they are human beings seeking a return to a familiar non <UNK> existence that is beyond the <UNK> they experience everyday not that they are ever happy or sad but they achieve a type of self <UNK> when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living they only achieve true life in the natural world even though that is the next victim of modern existence at the end <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> to the natural world as even the most desolate pieces of the earth <UNK> to our notions of progress we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit
<START> yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more gay or <UNK> its a great <UNK> for anyone who likes film very funny sad and interesting never dull great access a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching great 10 out of 10 i got to see part of this <UNK> years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are very revealing about <UNK> of the performers who are like heavy weight <UNK> trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first <UNK> so what an achievement cool track it down
<START> i hate this movie it was nothing like the book and just thinking about it makes me mad if you watch the movie before reading the book then yeah it's a good movie but king's book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it i mean the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different the ending for example so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid <UNK> yeah there is no <UNK> in the book and there is no reason for it another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr <UNK> what the heck he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't important overall it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off
<START> call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series if you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one perhaps more compelling than that of <UNK> caretaker which launched the series with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> adventures are completely different yet strangely familiar the music is catchy too no true sci fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode and these <UNK> make the wait worthwhile
<START> don't see this movie bad acting and stupid gore effects a complete waste of time i was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks instead the director <UNK> on animal slaughter videos to shock you the watcher disgusting the murders are pretty lame basically <UNK> one woman he <UNK> worms in her mouth one he puts raw <UNK> on her face and <UNK> her btk btk <UNK> <UNK> king's killer new <UNK> ha ha i don't think this movie relied too much on actual facts i mean he real btk killer didn't carry around a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> and worms and oh yeah a slaughtered cow head too go figure
<START> this film was pure pain sitting in the theater for x amount of minutes i was wondering when the film was going to start all the <UNK> were in place typical love story characters have to overcome their short <UNK> villain has to emerge but none of it ever <UNK> by the time these things happened i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely <UNK> in scenes that required immense tension and <UNK> it felt like necessary frames were cut kid's stuff does not have to be this way children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones the excuse hey its for kids is bull i'll take sword in the stone any day this was terrible i'm getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days and as for the kids the 10 year i saw this with will agree pure trash
<START> this production of oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul what makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright unseen character who <UNK> this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the <UNK> dangers safely into the hands of his own relative <UNK> though oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death he fears no evil a rod and staff are there to comfort him in the end he is saved from the <UNK> of humanity at the bottom is fagin the most wicked of the lot fagin <UNK> <UNK> of his ways not once but twice yet <UNK> because he is unwilling to pay the price fagin is worse than bill <UNK> because he raises little <UNK> who become murderers in the middle is oliver his innocence is <UNK> but <UNK> as well the best is nancy lacking in judgment she ignores bill <UNK> violent nature out of her deep need for love yet unlike fagin at the <UNK> cost of her own life she does <UNK> of her sins by saving oliver from bill things are not as they seem in my opinion this quality is what makes art worthwhile <UNK> i would give this film a 10 but its <UNK> made for tv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting overall a fine <UNK> and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> is an excellent tv show br br yes it is predictable much like the dukes of hazzard hunter the a team etc etc etc br br this show is just good clean television the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> is quite amusing they often take <UNK> at each other several times an episode which adds a great deal of humor to the show it contains several car chases in almost every episode but who doesn't enjoy a good car chase especially with the <UNK> br br i only wish they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this
<START> being a <UNK> <UNK> it's hard to <UNK> review a movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> characters who are hard to root for typical heavy handed anti violence messages and a predictable <UNK> <UNK> ending makes this an awkward watch
<START> in the previews the 40 year old virgin boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40 ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't too many past bad experiences have <UNK> his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely and then the unexpected happens he falls in love what's more there's a movie out about it and it's called the 40 year old virgin br br the virgin of the title is andy <UNK> steve carell who is indeed 40 works as an employee at an <UNK> store and <UNK> vintage action figures which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see he has a lovely home theater system and watches survivor with his two kind elderly neighbors he's a pretty <UNK> definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women br br now here's the real novelty with this picture it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute mature fashion this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers it could have <UNK> into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never <UNK> that low sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few <UNK> are aimed at the gay community which are in no way meant to be taken as gay bashing as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game mortal <UNK> deception no less the ultimate <UNK> driven <UNK> for guys br br as someone who is rapidly approaching 20 <UNK> <UNK> toys action figures and has himself never done the deed i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar themed movie could never have been i was able to relate to the character of andy <UNK> more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing everyone else looked like they were all past 40 a bit arrogant i know but would you you is <UNK> still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of the 40 year old virgin br br of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with morning rise don't ask and he's <UNK> by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex when it's first discovered andy is a virgin at 40 his three buddies and fellow <UNK> store <UNK> david paul rudd jay <UNK> <UNK> and cal seth <UNK> all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman which couldn't be any further from the truth the truth is andy loves women but past traumatic experiences revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence have put him on the <UNK> for good br br david jay and cal each <UNK> on a mission to get andy laid so help them all but you know that such <UNK> will only end in disaster as proved by one date with <UNK> leslie mann who puts andy through the worst drunk driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth elizabeth banks the pretty girl who works in the <UNK> and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend br br things <UNK> up for andy when he meets <UNK> catherine <UNK> the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people hmmm and with that nice looking collection of action figures you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff <UNK> him that is if he can ever do the deed br br at last this is the sex romp we've been waiting for it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture how many of us lonely guys want to be a lonely guy forever the important thing we're taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself i don't think he needs to go through body <UNK> like andy does which is side splitting to be honest and according to this website and various other news <UNK> was in fact real and so was the blood on <UNK> shirt afterward br br the 40 year old virgin was directed by judd <UNK> and co written by himself and carell which <UNK> as a skit that starred carell carell is sweet and human as his character is not some <UNK> who approaches this thing with his eyes shut this is probably one of the most intelligent <UNK> i've ever seen and is not offensive a whole lot because its characters are treated with dignity and respect even <UNK> buddies who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship <UNK> can be related to on a fundamental level br br the way the 40 year old virgin plays out is indeed funny in the end but i'll leave that up to you the viewer to observe surely if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine <UNK> then it's true it is never too late br br 10 10
<START> this movie was slower then <UNK> in january in <UNK> the man who put <UNK> the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were <UNK> into the preview i had to wake up the people i was watching it with several times after it was over i felt bad for having <UNK> them up br br most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen but nothing ever does it was easy to loose track of people's motives and the characters were flat and <UNK> by the end of the movie you just hoped everyone would died everyone runs around either being <UNK> petty or pitiful and usually all three br br and worse we watched a minute or two of the added features just for kicks and <UNK> you understand and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are if they had spend the time on the movie that they did <UNK> themselves on the back it might have been worth watching br br i was brought in expecting the excitement of <UNK> ' i got a lecture on social awareness through the <UNK> eyes of the <UNK>
<START> typically terrible trash from director fred <UNK> ray about a female cyborg hunter <UNK> <UNK> by warden jan michael vincent to find and <UNK> escaped alien convict ross <UNK> who has <UNK> course for earth soon forest ranger john phillip law will have to protect a group of <UNK> hammy college kids headed by the grating richard <UNK> who ran over <UNK> with his <UNK> on a camping trip gone awry soon the cyborg will be <UNK> away with her arm laser burning one innocent alcoholic doctor robert <UNK> of count <UNK> vampire fame proving that no one will stand in it's way of <UNK> the hide of the convict whose collar is a tracking device that <UNK> his body law finds an ally in leo gordon an old vietnam war vet with way too weapons <UNK> in his cabin br br perhaps intentionally made awful this features what fans of <UNK> cinema <UNK> for dreadful special effects acting and premise at least the film has <UNK> soles for some eye candy even in <UNK> she was quite <UNK> that laser gun sure is funny it can <UNK> some houses yet when the cyborg shoots at law it barely leaves a mark on the location fired
<START> i grew up on the <UNK> <UNK> theatrical version <UNK> and as a kid i loved it more than part i since not only did it contain more superman and three superman type villains it started off with a bang  the best clark kent to superman <UNK> and rescue scenes kids no longer had to <UNK> wait for superman to appear on screen as in part i now as an adult i can see how the mighty had fallen with <UNK> see my review i've always heard of the back story on how they <UNK> and <UNK> fired the <UNK> director richard <UNK> from part ii it must have been a <UNK> back then to film two separate movies simultaneously now it's common <UNK> to the <UNK> and <UNK> 2 3 for example unfortunately after finally seeing the richard <UNK> cut or <UNK> i still can't fully recommend it gone was the great superman change scene the entire paris rescue as was the wonderful <UNK> of part i in <UNK> opening in fact they all but wrote the words previously on <UNK> in <UNK> the special effects weren't great in either part i or <UNK> but <UNK> they were mostly downright laughable  such as lois falling from the daily planet window i will admit some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed <UNK> such as any scene in the honeymoon <UNK> overall if you grew up on <UNK> as i did and loved it as a child  not <UNK> as i do as an adult you should absolutely see <UNK> as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes spoiler alert unfortunately the worst change comes last gone was also the weird <UNK> kiss from <UNK> replaced with the exact same ending as 'i ' this is not only a lazy unoriginal <UNK> it doesn't make sense on why clark would go back to that diner if those events never actually happened and will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation
<START> st <UNK> fire has no bearing on life after university at all for the majority of us common folk anyway why was this garbage even made who can really relate to this who lives like these characters i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script there are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere it must have just been one whole joke to them on set br br i actually found this film insulting to my intelligence the only joy i got from this is hoping that sir john hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of the breakfast club was released br br don't make the same mistake i did of watching this because you enjoy 80's films it really is that offensive to the genre
<START> end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad being a big fan of mega star actor christopher lee i was fooled like <UNK> <UNK> a good cast does not mean it'll be a good film the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium many parts of the movie are too dark to see whats going on the rest of the cast is shown briefly like <UNK> <UNK> dean jagger and macdonald carey as a security guard i would expect better from charles band who made good fun movies like the re <UNK> and dolls i heard christopher lee was tricked into making this film he was told his co stars were going to be jose <UNK> john <UNK> and dean jagger well dean jagger is there but the other two never made it lucky them if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline dean jagger went on to do two good movies afterwards alligator 80 and game of death <UNK> sue <UNK> <UNK> is also in the movie minus her <UNK> if you are a <UNK> for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie 1 out of 10
<START> to put it simply i am not fond of westerns and having never sat through one from beginning to end i decided to watch my darling <UNK> and see it all the way through no matter how painful it was for me at first it was excruciating as expected i found the acting to be laughable the scenery your standard <UNK> horses and <UNK> boring and the music and its timing <UNK> on the edge of painful however after mentally <UNK> talking myself to struggle on after the first 20 minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure focusing in on the cinematography and how john ford managed to make even the <UNK> situations dull according to me that is look quite stunning at times made it a lot more interesting br br in conclusion i can't go so far as to say that i enjoyed the movie by the end of it however it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end and that in itself <UNK> me
<START> to all of <UNK> who think 1 this was a boring <UNK> 2 <UNK> <UNK> and denzel washington did not deserve their oscars br br shut the f k up this was one of the best academy awards show because 1 it was a moment in history to have a black yes black actress win an academy award for best actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years to be honest i had stop watching the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in either the winners or <UNK> to me it was nothing but a bunch of white people <UNK> each other in the back the academy had many chances to vote black actresses that were brilliant in movies <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whoopi goldberg diana ross mary jean <UNK> but it did not 2 <UNK> <UNK> deserved that oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actresses been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voters yeah yeah nicole kidman sang very <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> but it was time black people were <UNK> in these awards shows as for mr washington the academy <UNK> him big time after that unfair loss for <UNK> to all of you who think race is not an issue probably white people in the movie industry well it is many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to <UNK> typical made by white people roles of what they think is a black women or are not existence angela <UNK> i do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it come to think of it they are the one who been <UNK> it
<START> recently i was looking for the newly <UNK> wide screen dvd of fly away home and came upon interesting title that i had never heard of grey owl the fact that it was a richard attenborough film caught my attention he responsible for such fine films as gandhi chaplin and <UNK> i noticed that the screenplay was by william nicholson author of <UNK> this special edition was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under 10 00 so i <UNK> it bought it wow what a beautiful film pierce brosnan stars as <UNK> grey owl a real life <UNK> in the 1930s who came to love and respect the wild lands of canada and worked to help protect them brosnan who starred in a james bond film gives a <UNK> warm powerful performance as does annie <UNK> as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land especially the <UNK> a fine score by george <UNK> the <UNK> and beautiful <UNK> by roger <UNK> add greatly to the <UNK> of the film and the extras on this dvd are something else includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real grey owl as well as audio commentary tracks by attenborough and producer jake <UNK> 2 <UNK> and many other fine <UNK> plus <UNK> for those having access to a pc with dvd <UNK> features grey owl has been released directly to dvd in the united states a fact that richard attenborough attributes to hollywood's lack of interest in <UNK> something that isn't loaded with a lot of violence and sex this is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about i had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion and a whole new love and understanding for <UNK> grey owl is a very fine film worth checking out this is one i look forward to sharing with others
<START> <UNK> takes the usual story about the art world <UNK> you can't paint that but i want to and <UNK> it with sex and scandal to make the whole film well interesting but not remarkable br br the story is about one of the first female <UNK> around <UNK> who course is <UNK> independent but just can't stop thinking of men and their <UNK> for artistic purposes of course she soon gets private <UNK> from one of a well known artist but soon <UNK> becomes much more then art and soon after that scandal <UNK> funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft porn fantasy i mean was <UNK> that much of a man hungry person also it's quite funny when she's <UNK> that she paints for herself yet falls for the first person she sees br br actually the story itself is quite fascinating and it ends with a trial which i always love but i wasn't too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn't fall for i <UNK> gone for the young <UNK> p
<START> this is the best dub i've ever heard by disney as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack themes characters dialogues in <UNK> delivery service <UNK> br br this one has different atmosphere especially the <UNK> from the common heroine this one has both hero and heroine although i don't really <UNK> the use of hero heroine here since miyazaki is out from the stereotype common theme as usual after being introduced by spirited away amazed by <UNK> troubled by grave of <UNK> and deeply touched by <UNK> no <UNK> this one start with a bit doubt in my part wondering if this will be the first <UNK> dud well in the end just like only yesterday and <UNK> of the heart i ended up giving 10 rating i'd give 9 8 rating but the additional 0 2 is there to share the good feeling by <UNK> people to see the movie br br spoiler somehow i see this as a sad movie people die in this one the lonely robot the abandoned place and it ends with destruction it is as if mankind really can't live with too much power the <UNK> scene gave me <UNK> of metropolis ending it's just sad somehow the plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well as always joe <UNK> really belongs to <UNK> <UNK> williams caliber people who can brings a movie a game an event to life even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition br br this is a feel good movie that used to be part of us cinema in the classic days it's a wonderful life etc etc well things change
<START> this is just about in the same league as the black <UNK> although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9 that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing br br the invisible <UNK> is part horror part drama and certainly part sci fi for a movie made in 1936 the sci fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time the mixture of horror drama and sci fi are a perfect blend while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better br br director <UNK> <UNK> captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often what i'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot the scene with the <UNK> outside of <UNK> room is a perfect example of the mood it's a standout moment in the film which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre br br as with the black <UNK> and island of lost <UNK> i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling br br anyway watch this film if you get the chance when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an <UNK> spot within your dvd library
<START> i just watched the incredible melting man for the second time and it was even more boring than when i first watched it i don't understand why it has become such a <UNK> <UNK> when it is so <UNK> dull the opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the <UNK> of blood and runs for her dear life after this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut the makeup is quite good and his melting <UNK> face looks fairly realistic there is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it <UNK> until it reaches a <UNK> where it falls on rocks and bursts open there's not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening there isn't much gore at least in the <UNK> dvd i watched br br no the incredible melting man is not that great at all i'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it if you want a true sci fi horror cult classic watch the deadly <UNK> instead
<START> i'll give writer director william <UNK> credit for finding someone to <UNK> this ill conceived thriller a good argument for not wasting money <UNK> to hbo let alone buying dvds based on cover art and <UNK> a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard <UNK> add nothing significant to their <UNK> although the art direction is not half bad the dialogue will leave you <UNK> with wonder at its <UNK> this is storytelling at its worst no tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no <UNK> no nothing a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer i feel sorry for the guy who <UNK> this thing good for late night <UNK> out viewing only you have been warned
<START> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> is the best comedy of all times believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it but truth is that the humour in this comedy is special it is <UNK> for <UNK> and all former republic of <UNK> know it very well so i think the rest of audience for example in europe can't enjoy it so much because the subtitles ruin the hole thing but they should at least try yes it is ironic this is the best flick in serbian history and the world doesn't understand it if you have got a chance to see this one don't blew up ok
<START> <UNK> and the <UNK> is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy hippie cult killing spree horror movie apparently even nearly twenty years later charles <UNK> was still inspiring <UNK> but incompetent trash filmmakers this is a typical troma production meaning in other words there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to <UNK> the nonsensical plot there's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at <UNK> and the <UNK> is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice like the circle saw killing for example the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addicted and charlie <UNK> wannabe paul one of paul's lower <UNK> <UNK> named <UNK> becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug <UNK> and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy <UNK> is he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black <UNK> <UNK> girl there's an annoying <UNK> soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo artistic camera tricks like slow motion footage and lurid dream sequences maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and <UNK> is when a poor girl is cut in half with a <UNK> for no particular reason the camera holds the shot of the blade in the <UNK> stomach for fifteen whole seconds

<START> i saw this for gary busey and fred <UNK> thinking they were buddy cops they are but busey is in the opening scene then doesn't show up again until like 40 minutes into the movie though every scene he's in is awesome especially when he <UNK> himself as a blind <UNK> br br what's incredible about this movie is the plot in the movie fred <UNK> is trying to find out who stalking and killing phone sex <UNK> at one point i think thats its busey but it turns out i'm only partly right busey is not the killer but he is calling up and <UNK> the women over the phone why i don't know in no way is he connected to the killer he just does it for kicks i guess
<START> a famous conductor decides after a heart attack to go back to the village where he was born to live a quiet life there he comes in dutch with the local church choir that will change his life br br i had no expectations when i saw this movie for the first time yesterday i like watching foreign movies that are not english and i've already seen a couple of swedish movies in my life but this one was the best so far br br where to start in my opinion this film is a jewel thanks to many things of which one is the outstanding acting michael <UNK> is perfect as the thoughtful almost shy and devoted conductor daniel <UNK> beautiful <UNK> <UNK> is enchanting with her pretty smile and her subtle acting the choir members are all well developed interesting characters with their own story each br br this movie tells a story a beautiful story about music love pain memories death about a man who devoted his life to music and who tries to create a calm existence in the village where he was born while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been till then kay <UNK> shows us that the swedish are outstanding movie creators go see <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> it's a movie that makes you think about life and love and that's also <UNK> in some way
<START> this is one of those horror flicks where twenty somethings fool around with the dark arts around a camp fire getting into a heap of trouble for doing so a <UNK> was opened containing a world of demons known as the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> by a man whose daughter summer gets kidnapped by something taken into it summer is trained by a mysterious group whose identities are never revealed to battle the demon monsters this is a portion of the plot which lends itself to <UNK> anyway three <UNK> witches who went to high school together <UNK> the most enthusiastic serious <UNK> in the dark arts and her lesbian <UNK> <UNK> and marlene it's more or less a passing <UNK> with them though join up with buddies jason and ricky on a trip in the wilderness where summer <UNK> from her home ten years ago opening the <UNK> through a spoken text written in an ancient book a demon is set free as is summer now a warrior babe whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skills that have been needed to ward off monsters in the other world br br low budget contains a <UNK> but ambitious story <UNK> it into a confined setting these young adults spend a lot of time running around in the woods hoping not to be fodder for a beast as can be the case in these movies the demon stands on the <UNK> while the story develops as summer attempts to remember how everything came to pass while <UNK> jason who wishes to help her <UNK> the lost time the action is shot mostly in the dark making any violence hard to <UNK> <UNK> kingsley and the rest of the female cast for that matter is some mighty nice eye candy dressed scantily clad as a female conan a gorgeous body we have to pleasure to <UNK> upon from the moment she appears until the closing of the movie some <UNK> some kissing and <UNK> and nudity spice things up nicely and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot it's so preposterous that the silly tone is probably appropriate for the material br br might be of interest for co starring world wrestling <UNK> captain courageous christian real name jason <UNK> as one of the group <UNK> his alter ego as a chicken <UNK> at the sound of a <UNK> tree <UNK> <UNK> cannon is likable as unlikely hero jason a <UNK> naive young man whose ex fiancé <UNK> vanessa james is now <UNK> sexual and in love with marlene <UNK> cruelty is in <UNK> with <UNK> feelings by hiding her affair with marlene from his knowledge while ricky and <UNK> attempt to steer him away from this idea that he can <UNK> a dead flame that gone out never to <UNK> again the <UNK> demon is mostly darkly lit i guess to <UNK> from showing how ludicrous laughable it looks if presented in full the lesbian antics of <UNK> and marlene <UNK> shannon is mostly tame their love making once alone in the woods up against a tree is toned down and also <UNK> using the <UNK> of night my rating is a bit <UNK> towards it almost solely because of kingsley for purely superficial reasons rather than the plot or film making the movie aims to please and is <UNK> to the boys and girls who love hot women i think though for the most part the humor falls a bit flat
<START> <UNK> <UNK> rex reed gets a sex change from a doctor john carradine dead drunk and comes out as myra <UNK> welch she then decides to destroy male <UNK> or something like that and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by <UNK> john huston don't ask and break up a young happy couple young handsome hunky roger <UNK> and farrah fawcett yes the farrah fawcett br br they took a great novel by gore <UNK> that was <UNK> and naturally tried to film it they also hired an english guy with a decidedly anti american attitude and hired a bunch of actors with questionable talent welch reed and <UNK> old professionals huston carradine andy <UNK> jim <UNK> mae west threw it all together and surprise an absolute disaster br br the film got an x rating at its release it's been <UNK> to an r mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which welch <UNK> rusty roger <UNK> and a scene in which welch attempts to have sex with fawcett br br the movie is very <UNK> scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense it's not good at all but i was never bored br br acting <UNK> wildly reed is horrible really sad huston <UNK> the scenery again and again and again to a nauseating extreme welch is actually not bad as myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her west is hardly in the movie a <UNK> and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost 80 years old cracking sex jokes roger <UNK> whatever happened to was very young handsome and not bad as rusty fawcett is ok br br it's hard to find things to say about this you just watch it in disbelief a must see movie to believe
<START> and you get <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> don't get me wrong this movie is much less explicit or not even than pretty woman but it was a new topic for bollywood the topic was accepted but it is far from <UNK> murder and julie to tell you the truth the topic is presented in a very clean manner but the plot has it's number of clichés the beginning of the movie is presented in a very <UNK> way there are some very little plot holes the movie picks up once <UNK> has her <UNK> where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning the acting couldn't have been any better salman khan sometimes <UNK> and sometimes lets you down over here he gave one of the best performances on top of that his role is written so well that you applaud every time he <UNK> a problem <UNK> <UNK> was adequate throughout the movie you feel for her character the most but she is overshadowed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is picture perfect out of the three she gives everyone a run for their money its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent and trust me <UNK> is far from your girl next door this role is one of the reasons why i rate her high the supporting cast are like the family you see in <UNK> where they have no significance to the plot yet i found them tolerable here the songs are pretty nice the title song is my favorite of them all along with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hearts <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> look at the world's sight are two song that fit the film perfectly <UNK> <UNK> number <UNK> <UNK> crazy could've been <UNK> while no 1 <UNK> came across boring though it had good dancing otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch
<START> i grew up b 1965 watching and loving the thunderbirds all my mates at school watched we played thunderbirds before school during lunch and after school we all wanted to be <UNK> or scott no one wanted to be alan counting down from 5 became an art form i took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what i loved as a child how <UNK> disappointing the only high point was the snappy theme tune not that it could compare with the original score of the thunderbirds thankfully early saturday <UNK> one television channel still plays reruns of the series <UNK> anderson and his wife created <UNK> <UNK> should hand in his directors chair his version was completely hopeless a waste of film utter rubbish a cgi remake may be acceptable but replacing <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was a huge error of judgment
<START> this movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it in some ways a <UNK> in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a <UNK> style attack while this movie does not answer all the big questions it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with through the movie you are shown how the actors <UNK> <UNK> shot guns made <UNK> bombs and came up with an action plan for zero day the actors if you can call them that were brilliant they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives but at no stage did i <UNK> them really acting something tom cruise should try the use of the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> at the end was genius but i'm not sure if we needed the very last scene overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic
<START> it's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film an entirely new <UNK> will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as <UNK> or even <UNK> in rabbit test so as a small contribution to this future effort i'd like to suggest this word br br <UNK> <UNK> a combination of <UNK> and <UNK> used to describe overly ambitious <UNK> like the film rabbit test br br joan rivers and hollywood <UNK> producer jay <UNK> have severely over reached their <UNK> abilities to <UNK> in this <UNK> minute festival of <UNK> trying to put together an airplane style comedy with a <UNK> collection of gags note to joan german doctors haven't been funny since vaudeville <UNK> from their graves in the <UNK> that's is bad enough but <UNK> this cinematic crime is <UNK> directorial style which can best be described as <UNK> and a cast of once and future has <UNK> so eager to please they <UNK> even the weakest of throwaway gags br br <UNK> in this <UNK> sea of <UNK> is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film's hapless protagonist lionel watching crystal in this <UNK> is much like watching a blind person take a <UNK> in a <UNK> eventually the cringe <UNK> becomes a semi permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face br br i can only <UNK> about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test <UNK> <UNK> and mildly retarded <UNK> are all likely candidates but for self aware thinking humans i'd <UNK> recommend <UNK> <UNK> in your eyes before i'd recommend rabbit test
<START> plot synopsis hong kong 1966 paul wagner the man who built the victoria tunnel is murdered along with his wife by his associates his twin sons <UNK> alex are split apart 25 years later <UNK> a karate <UNK> in los angeles alex a <UNK> living in hong kong join forces to avenge their parents' murder rightfully claim the tunnel br br this is the second time that jean claude van damme <UNK> <UNK> have worked together having previously done <UNK> this is also the first of three films to feature van damme playing <UNK> roles maximum risk <UNK> are the others the plot is a very simplistic take on the revenge story the film's sole redeeming feature being van <UNK> performance as two very different people  the <UNK> rich kid the rough <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tough guy as it goes van damme doesn't do a very good job in either role although his take on alex is mildly amusing it is puzzling as to have the brothers mistaken for each other with them wearing different clothes having different <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes a very worthy henchman for the baddies
<START> to call this episode brilliant feels like too little to say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is <UNK> too 'cause there's never been a far from great sopranos episode so far in fact the title might be a smug <UNK> for those who aren't real fans yet join the club br br picking up where junior left off putting a bullet in his <UNK> gut after <UNK> him for a crook he killed in the first season the story begins with tony being absolutely fine with no <UNK> whatsoever of what happened to him he's attending some kind of convention only he's not speaking with his normal accent and there seems to be something wrong with his papers apparently he is not tony soprano but kevin <UNK> or at least that's what a group of people think and until the mess is <UNK> out he can't leave his hotel br br naturally in pure sopranos tradition that turns out to be nothing but a dream tony is actually in a coma with the doctors uncertain regarding his fate his family and friends worried sick and junior <UNK> to believe the whole thing actually happened unfortunately it did and anthony jr looks willing to avenge the attempt on his father's life br br dreams have popped up rather frequently in the series often as some kind of spiritual trial for the protagonists most notably in the season five show the test dream join the club however takes the <UNK> qualities of the program already hinted at by the previous <UNK> use of a william s <UNK> poem and pushes the <UNK> in the most <UNK> way tony <UNK> about his dead friends the first <UNK> of the sort was caused by food <UNK> four seasons ago is one thing him actually being in what would appear to be <UNK> is <UNK> different the heavenly section of the story is <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> not least the name tony is given as one character points out spelling it in a certain way will give you the word <UNK> and none of it comes off as overblown or far fetched david chase has created a piece of work that is far too intelligent to use weird set ups just for their own sake it all helps the narrative talking about help from above in the case of tony soprano might be <UNK> it a tad though
<START> i recently watched this film at the <UNK> <UNK> film festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to watch don't get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films e g <UNK>  hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films this one falls into the latter category the cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous <UNK> shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light <UNK> and non existing the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la jason <UNK> from friday the <UNK> the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an <UNK> needing sleep
<START> well what was fun except for the fun part br br it's my second least favorite so far i even thought it was worse than <UNK> and <UNK> in the <UNK> br br let's start with the good the <UNK> it was incredibly well done and also emotional being the great animal lover that i am it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode br br but then there's all the bad and believe me there is a lot of it little made sense so those animals were being <UNK> by aliens and <UNK> <UNK> the dialog was also pretty awful there were about one or two <UNK> lines br br and worst of all having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me in the end what's the point they all pretty much died we didn't learn anything we weren't entertained and i couldn't even find <UNK> death sad just very frustrating br br star shame because season 2 was doing so well
<START> this movie is a perfect portrayal of the <UNK> the dancing is wonderful the scenery in the background was excellent and i loved that floating bed br br oh and the costumes i particularly loved <UNK> the <UNK> was adorable the special effects were very well done e g the tree the bed etc and i quite enjoyed the rats i love how they didn't make them scary but cute and <UNK> except for the king i suppose br br if you're a thoroughly <UNK> person you won't enjoy this but this is a very good movie that's good for all ages just not all levels of <UNK> br br but i have a few complaints br br firstly why did they have to put the sugar <UNK> <UNK> partner in those terrible <UNK> it would barely make a difference if he was butt naked and secondly why on earth did they have to make <UNK> outfit pink
<START> if you have seen friends the writing will feel very familiar especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy <UNK> br br the show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young about 10 years old i think now they're in their mid <UNK> and they meet again on a class reunion this is where the series starts br br a typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once they're usually not connected in any way each story line is cut up into multiple sections which are then shown in a mixed order br br the sketches is where my problems lie with this series as in the later seasons of friends it's often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations one of the main characters does something really stupid that's hard to believe the situation is then heavily exaggerated as if it wasn't silly enough if you're into this kind of in your face humor then maybe you'll like this series for me it is a great turn off br br the reason i started watching friends is because of the first few seasons there are interesting and especially credible story lines with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters the class has none of this the characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far it's therefore not possible to relate to them and like them br br at least with friends it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all <UNK> out but in the class it seems it has run out of steam before it even started
<START> while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described <UNK> chase as unfunny in this film he certainly is it's a shame as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few <UNK> chase <UNK> and assumed the guy wasn't funny films like mighty like a <UNK> and what price goofy are very good chase films so he could be really funny given good material unfortunately in this film he's given absolutely nothing even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a <UNK> and the gags are so poor it's a shame as i really wanted to love this film but couldn't br br by the way for those used to the look for <UNK> from the mid 1920s on you'll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or mustache and looks very little like you'd expect
<START> as an altman fan i'd sought out this movie for years thinking that with such a great cast it would have to be at least <UNK> brilliant br br big mistake br br this is one of altman's big cast <UNK> thrown together <UNK> and <UNK> or so it feels with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room it doesn't br br as <UNK> points out this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> the vets all around her but other than that avoid at all costs which is pretty easy to do it's never been released on video to my knowledge and its cable appearances have the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong <UNK> in the battle scenes this film is a true stinker br br this is the second film that i've seen in recent days directed by alexander <UNK> the first was charles <UNK> <UNK> it was so lousy that i shut it off this one i'm afraid is not very much better br br <UNK> <UNK> is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth perhaps her performance as the virgin queen was good for <UNK> standards but when you compare it to that of a helen <UNK> it is absolutely no match in robotic fashion <UNK> states her lines her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spirit br br even a dashing laurence olivier can't save this utter piece of boredom br br future wife <UNK> leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn't really convey anything here to think that scarlett was 2 years later br br it's a shame that history with the spanish <UNK> is made out to be so boring in this film
<START> r o b o t j o x br br burn the master br br <UNK> horrible br br no ending no closure br br completely and utterly the worst movie ever made br br <UNK> the adventures of <UNK> <UNK> as the worst movie of all time br br i hate this utterly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mess of a thing called robot <UNK> and i just found out they made a second one i apologize to <UNK> sandler <UNK> the <UNK> and eddie murphy <UNK> <UNK> for hating their movies this mess of a thing makes those movies only bad not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing this is the only movie for which i have ever said this remove it from netflix now 10 000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful
<START> this is a very strange film by director animator richard williams all who know of <UNK> work know it's a bit off <UNK> if not ingenious but this one takes the cake br br it features two hapless <UNK> who have to save their <UNK> new french doll from a <UNK> pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality its strange character designs its powerful animation and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary <UNK> brilliant animation portrayed <UNK> ann and andy as real <UNK> dolls <UNK> and <UNK> rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls which made it more believable at least in a visual sense the animation shines on the bring us the <UNK> with the <UNK> knees whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end the silent movie chase with sir leonard looney and of course the greedy br br the greedy animation on its own is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i've ever seen there's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop and every second it's something new living in what was deemed the <UNK> pit the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats <UNK> he sings a song that i can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones then tries to kill <UNK> ann for her candy heart br br the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs it continuously <UNK> down the movie's pace because there are sixteen of them there are about six good songs which should have been the only ones including i look and what do i see no girl's toy blue though they didn't need to make him sing it twice i never get enough because i love you and maybe i'm home the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to br br this is a weird film with strange undertones but if that's what you're looking for you won't find better
<START> this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though <UNK> for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub <UNK> for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time period it is set there is no modern technology shown not even the <UNK> chinese <UNK> just a drab almost <UNK> everyday life against which is <UNK> the dazzling display of the <UNK> opera and of <UNK> fireworks even when a group of soldiers refer to their <UNK> departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past 150 years br br but then we briefly see a <UNK> car late 30s early 40s style and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge <UNK> and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the <UNK> of world war 2 and the communist revolution br br which makes the central character's desire to <UNK> to old customs and traditions all the more poignant br br but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world the <UNK> between boys and girls men and women the trade for various purposes in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendship br br maybe i'm reading too much into this film but i don't think so i also think that it is a scandal that films of this <UNK> are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst <UNK> is passed off as quality material br br but don't get me started on that
<START> three girls an all female media crew including cult actress barbara bach no less visiting a small town to cover a festival end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague well made little shocker suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue scenes and a rather thin plot line that doesn't do very well in hiding its secrets one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing as in vintage shock material and this is basically what the film <UNK> on performances cinematography are pretty much above par compared to many other late 70's early 80's films in the same vein but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax scene in the basement setting from the moment that <UNK> junior character was introduced his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn't close until the end of the film a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney <UNK> who was <UNK> <UNK> in one flew over the <UNK> nest and now utterly demented in the unseen take on one of the leading roles
<START> i just came back from the late night cinema and it was indeed a silent way out as most of the audience <UNK> though the real life black white images of the <UNK> the freedom movement etc which was very much reminiscent of the <UNK> our <UNK> faced amidst this backdrop mind you there was no tel <UNK> internet in those times but for the very voice of truth non violence the cinematography <UNK> some spirit of stark reality of <UNK> amidst the strict raj br br gandhi shown as a <UNK> attorney in south africa who stood for his basic <UNK> and gave every degree of conviction to spread awareness of the same with <UNK> and <UNK> which to the <UNK> speech of general <UNK> was shown as a nice farewell on screen it had the best <UNK> speech with a subtle humour a <UNK> threat to the british raj in india there was a nice remark when he said we pray in silence to the british in india now that gandhi the politician is set for india towards <UNK> br br the very backdrop of a big family with many kids needs the mention of an obvious divided attention and love which had to cast it's spell on the unfortunate kid's psyche who was left alone to <UNK> for unrealistic ambitions little did harilal knew about his <UNK> and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasures in life and fails in front of the huge idol of his father he tries to do away from mentor ship which is the basis of any success which had to be seen by those fortunate <UNK> in the streets of <UNK> <UNK> when harilal <UNK> out his frustration in open this means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious <UNK> and alcoholism with debt and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his negative thoughts he still had shown the sincere love for his mother through <UNK> scenes and even <UNK> humble expressions form harilal to forgive him didn't meet any conclusions in his mind as he always feared the father gandhi br br he couldn't <UNK> the fact that gandhi couldn't share his love with him as he expected was driven to rebellion when he couldn't understand the equal merit based delivery of <UNK> money by his father to his cousin where he saw a failed opportunity to study for <UNK> in england br br this had to take it's <UNK> in him thrown to the streets as a <UNK> when the whole of india was celebrating the <UNK> the life of a <UNK> never changes come what may but the manner in which the sad death of <UNK> gandhi himself is shown brings in an emotional silence finally the last <UNK> thoughts of the dying harilal is shown as a flashback to keep the audience gripping and wondering where did the father of the nation go wrong was he clever enough to be mentally strong to lead an one man army use his brave soldier son as a weapon to show to the british rival forces that when it comes to the interest of the nation nothing comes in between sadly though that to read a <UNK> heart one has to live outside his family and see which the emotionally naive harilal couldn't see living inside br br a pity that such naive <UNK> are still ruining the efforts of many <UNK> like fathers in many families in <UNK> life and have taken to drugs alcoholism and god knows what thoughts here's a message to all those brave <UNK> soldier sons please respect the father of the nation please <UNK> and happiness shall be <UNK> or else it's a disaster in waiting isn't it
<START> what an ambitious project kenneth branagh <UNK> here and how well it was realized this is the first filmed version of <UNK> to use the full text of shakespeare's play but branagh didn't do it just because it was there his intention i believe was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without <UNK> it down so to speak in return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves a fair enough <UNK> and one that's a bargain br br the setting is a generic 19th century european one and this does more than work well it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself the production design and cinematography and both outstanding which helps immensely when you're watching a four hour movie branagh's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise the direction <UNK> the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a <UNK> version of a play since so much of <UNK> is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few <UNK> battles etc this can be a <UNK> task but everything branagh tries to do seems to work br br branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor writer directors if not always the best since he made his big <UNK> with <UNK> v ' one <UNK> i had with him was what i saw as a tendency to ham it up at times in his portrayal of hamlet here he might be accused of that again but there is a method at work let's face it <UNK> is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before he or she needs help even if they've read the play hamlet has the most lines of any <UNK> character and branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film even if you don't know the literal meaning of every <UNK> word this performance by branagh was at the very least worthy of an oscar nomination br br there are so many other outstanding performances here they're almost too numerous to mention but some of them must be acknowledged derek <UNK> as <UNK> is superb but even he takes a back seat to kate <UNK> when it comes to <UNK> out praise her portrayal of <UNK> is awesome in its depth of feeling made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time she looks to me like the finest young actress around other super performers in no particular order are richard <UNK> nicholas farrell michael <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and timothy <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> respectively honorable mention goes to julie christie charlton heston and robin williams who manages to do his thing here successfully even billy crystal as a <UNK> works the one cast member who doesn't inexplicably is jack lemmon in the very opening scene he appears and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor you know this must have been a real dilemma for branagh since everything else about the movies screams out that it's the work of a <UNK> br br not to be <UNK> when speaking of a four hour movie but it does seem just a tad too long some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit if i may be so bold and a little bit of <UNK> <UNK> would be welcome br br did i forget anything other than patrick <UNK> score no doubt i did i'll just sum up by saying that kenneth branagh may have made the definitive film version of <UNK> ' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one
<START> an <UNK> 10 the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of old hollywood sam <UNK> and meryl streep are very good together <UNK> matches streep line for line and take for take it is one of the best showcases yet of his <UNK> acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best notwithstanding the intensity of his role this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but <UNK> terms the movie which won several top awards in australia boasts not only a <UNK> cast and director but wonderful and authentic australian locales it proves that people are the same the world over and after all these years people still delight in repeating the famous streep line accent and all a <UNK> ate <UNK> baby including that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on seinfeld
<START> the cliché of the shell shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment pity a splendid cast acting to the limits of their high talents can't redeem 'the return of the <UNK> from its stiff <UNK> inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement best moments as another reviewer noted come when glenda jackson is on screen but even jackson's <UNK> good cinematic power can't pull this film's <UNK> from its cold never <UNK> <UNK> ann <UNK> she of sex <UNK> <UNK> and too often accused of lacking acting ability finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here despite her speaking with a <UNK> flawless <UNK> accent the hackneyed score <UNK> of many lackluster tv <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> is at irritating odds with the emotional <UNK> of the script <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of the direction except for its score and <UNK> script and direction 'the return of the <UNK> has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together
<START> the world of the dragon hunters is a 3d gravity challenged world <UNK> bits of buildings and strange flat plants <UNK> around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen it is a world reminiscent of <UNK> story when the nothing came to eat the world away br br funny enough the villain here is the world <UNK> as well this time it is a huge <UNK> dragon with fiery eyes the heroes are a big yet <UNK> warrior an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the <UNK> side of the duo and a strange useless animal they are joined by the most <UNK> little girl in the world who to my <UNK> did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death br br the animation is great the voices and the sounds are top notch too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine they go to stop the world <UNK> they reach him almost immediately they defeat him the end no real character development or story twists not even the ones i would expect from a movie with such a plot br br bottom line it's a cute thing to watch kids would probably enjoy it but that's about it no depth to this world pun intended
<START> though cher and cage are the <UNK> points of this story <UNK> and dukakis are good counterparts for them this is where loretta and <UNK> will be in 50 years still in love the whole cast does a nice job from aiello to john <UNK> it shows a real slice of life though i saw this long ago i am glad it finally <UNK> cage to the place where he was recognized in hollywood for his talent from the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments this is a very entertaining movie
<START> neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such <UNK> friends sharing an apartment br br lemmon is <UNK> felix <UNK> bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly <UNK> to share an apartment with oscar madison matthau with somewhat disastrous results seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other's ways with oscar being the <UNK> male imaginable and felix the exact opposite br br funniest scene for me was when the <UNK> <UNK> sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date the priceless interaction between lemmon matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in <UNK> the talented <UNK> sisters are the <UNK> who did the voices for the <UNK> sisters a pair of <UNK> in disney's the <UNK> and here their comic timing on top of <UNK> sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity where it remains much of the time br br if you're a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen <UNK> of his work this one is not to be missed matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast even though they considered <UNK> roles before filming began and of course it's easy to see why it became a top rated tv show later on br br <UNK> up top simon comedy not to be missed
<START> i just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first time it is a very emotional and beautiful movie with good acting and great family values inspiring and touching
<START> the extraordinary <UNK> <UNK> is the main reason to see this flick why she never became a bigger store may never be known but she is exceptional and steals every scene she's in <UNK> <UNK> directed this piece of fluff and the cast is first rate with robert <UNK> and brenda <UNK> especially memorable a 9 out of 10
<START> br br as with the other episodes in this made for tv series <UNK> on the many adventures of the sea legend <UNK> <UNK> super human <UNK> ruins all chance for suspense br br as little wesley <UNK> ruined many seasons of the next generation <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> saves every situation each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> superior <UNK> main trouble in this movie series seems to be <UNK> the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command a perfect being makes for dull story telling so superior is our hero that even those who attempt to help him are <UNK> to do something correctly unless <UNK> is there to direct and control their every move br br what is the sense in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time what is the point of watching such a story
<START> this is easily one of the worst martial arts films i've ever seen and that's saying something the <UNK> of <UNK> chiba <UNK> chiba is heard at the title soon you will be <UNK> to yourself stupid stupid the basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into japan and one man <UNK> to stop them of course that's our man sonny chiba the karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug <UNK> a woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard but what are her true intentions let me say at this point who cares soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment sonny eventually <UNK> out the bad guys with his karate skills end of story oh yeah the woman was corrupt too <UNK> you may have just watched the funniest film ever br br as stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films i have ever seen what makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be some have already mentioned the infamous american intro put into the film that's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it's beyond funny i would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70's karate scene was at the time watch as aaron banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then <UNK> a fat student bad editing <UNK> him in the throat but everything is badly done in this film terrible unbelievable fights fake i mean fake blood bad acting dubbing wardrobe and let's not forget the story one man to take out an entire drug problem in a country i bet fight after fight is laughable this was the 70's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight but chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie let's see he kicks a gun in half kicks a guy so hard what looks like his <UNK> fall out and of course <UNK> the bottle scene give me a break not to mention the fact that it's very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it's filmed so poorly one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound <UNK> ok as the action goes on we are treated to <UNK> of blood really fake blood too say it looked poorly made is and understatement the acting is totally non existent in this film i don't expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good but it wasn't and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor was it my imagination or did they dub the asian go go dancer with a black accent as expected from a 70's wardrobe you'll be in <UNK> laughing at some of the <UNK> and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black <UNK> <UNK> and hats all the time don't try and hide it now the characters were stupid as well the <UNK> club <UNK> one of whom is <UNK> out in a japanese <UNK> suit and the other who has a taste for <UNK> head looks like fat hippie also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman <UNK> it was very annoying br br overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making that doesn't mean that it's not entertaining with a film made so poorly it's hard not to laugh through most of this film if you can stomach it this was an old favorite watch with my best friend if it was purely bad i would give one star but the laughs it delivers <UNK> it up 4 out 10
<START> has anyone noticed that james earl jones is the <UNK> who is serving when <UNK> wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake i watched this movie on a video that i had taped off of the television when i watched this scene i thought i recognized the voice of jones when the <UNK> laughed at the end i <UNK> the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the <UNK> listen closely as the <UNK> laughs when <UNK> looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the <UNK> albeit quickly
<START> i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very exciting it was at least not like the teen slasher movies that pop out every now and then the search for the killer and the <UNK> relationship between the hero the so called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie also i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie i mean it's exciting maybe some time later i might watch the movie again
<START> this is what i call a pre sci fi sci fi movie it gets no better than lugosi karloff in this incredibly good mood type motion picture these two genuine artists are at their very best as is the story line br br karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a <UNK> of vanity pride and scientific competition i was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he <UNK> himself in the three previously mentioned concepts i was <UNK> and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in br br this is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake this time put harrison ford in the karloff part and maybe <UNK> sutherland as the bela <UNK> role it might be possible to do it almost as good br br this is one of the very best that hollywood ever produced as i said it gets no better no way
<START> when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society when a comedian actor makes <UNK> sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves do i want to support that behavior in this case mr foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong good behavior from bad that loving kindness is better than <UNK> mr foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from saying sorry does not get him off the hook it will not <UNK> the hurt or remove the bad behavior he <UNK> to our youth one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it no longer see anything they are part of we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them
<START> i had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have failed miserably to do this film was void of all the video whore clichés and it also <UNK> the gangsters <UNK> and foul language it examined several relationships among <UNK> african americans and african american male female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues the film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time i saw it at the boston film festival as well it premiered at <UNK> <UNK> boston and i truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences black people and everyone else would love a movie like this if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there br br as an extra if your a doctor a resident a medical student a <UNK> student married to a doctor have a doctor sibling have a doctor in the family or know a great doctor period they would love this film as well it portrayed <UNK> and the practice in a true to life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors residents and medical students who viewed the film dennis cooper completely his <UNK> in internal medicine so he definitely applied his knowledge experience to the film and that is greatly apparent
<START> i bought this a year or more ago for 2 yep 2 left it on the shelf for ages now watching dvds while <UNK> up with a cold br br this is a haunting movie brilliant performances by all involved especially the <UNK> boy about the only smiles you get in this movie br br plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever <UNK> <UNK> blank but obviously that's lighthearted this is heavy hearted br br as a psychologist a <UNK> and <UNK> psychologist a <UNK> went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed scary stuff brilliant work all round br br pete
<START> phantom lady 1944 <UNK> robert <UNK> br br production universal pictures br br scott henderson alan curtis following a nasty fight and split with his wife looks to <UNK> his <UNK> at the local <UNK> hole there he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and looking for some <UNK> asks her to a show at a club to get both their minds off their problems she agrees but only on the condition that they keep their names to themselves sure enough when scott gets home he finds the police there waiting to question him his wife's been murdered where were you at 8 <UNK> this evening asks inspector burgess thomas <UNK> but scott has an <UNK> right only he doesn't know the woman's name and the bartender remembers scott but not the woman neither does the cab driver nor the drummer elisha cook jr at the club even the dancer at the club who scott clearly caught looking at the woman they were both wearing the same hat won't acknowledge there was someone with him something is going on but whatever it is scott is helpless to defend himself at a trial and is sentenced to death for his wife's murder on the <UNK> <UNK> in hollywood <UNK> history it's left to his loyal secretary <UNK> ella raines who's later joined by a sympathetic inspector burgess to find out the real killer before scott is executed br br phantom lady is built on themes that <UNK> almost <UNK> in <UNK> work for example the <UNK> antagonist is also seen in black angel and the <UNK> man additionally there is the character who becomes mentally unhinged by the death of a sweetheart or <UNK> as found in <UNK> in black and the bride wore black it can leave a viewer feeling like he's <UNK> on well worn ground but in the right hands the <UNK> plots sorry dialogue the narrative inconsistencies all are beside the point fortunately phantom lady was being guided by sound hands br br this is <UNK> first noir he would go on to <UNK> himself as one of the if not the <UNK> <UNK> of the style the killers <UNK> cross here he is <UNK> paired with cinematographer woody <UNK> they would be reunited on christmas holiday and the killers there is some great storytelling done in the camera in one shot the <UNK> mental state of a character is shown as he sits in front of a 3 way mirror suggesting multiple personalities the same character who is an artist has van <UNK> self portrait with the <UNK> ear hanging on the wall in his apartment but what <UNK> and <UNK> are really doing in phantom lady is practically creating the look for noir released very early in 1944 it's all here the wet <UNK> the <UNK> of atmosphere and dread the <UNK> <UNK> b w the wildly <UNK> versions of reality when kansas visits scott in prison the <UNK> <UNK> of light etc it is a terrific picture to look at br br <UNK> tone aside the cast as well as the subject matter and relative <UNK> of the director and presumably the budget suggests <UNK> movie ambitions i thought tone was a little hammy alan curtis high <UNK> is not up to much and actually comes off pretty weak in a few scenes ella raines is mostly good and quite beautiful her <UNK> <UNK> with elisha cook jr is so delirious it has to be seen to be believed another standout scene is when kansas goes after the bartender to question him it amounts to a chase scene as she relentlessly dogs him through the streets with a stop at a subway station some real good tension in there br br out of 4
<START> dolph lundgren is back <UNK> marks <UNK> first film in nearly 2 years and that is following the <UNK> hidden agenda this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his <UNK> trilogy of jill rips agent red and <UNK> however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda which was better in almost every respect what this film does have in it's favour from <UNK> previous outing is a sense of cheesy fun the film also has a <UNK> dolph back in a high action role and it's good to see dolph doing his own stunts again br br the films story is ludicrous and prime b movie material an ex military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching whilst taking a <UNK> class he runs into some <UNK> bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy thankfully the filmmakers don't take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability this film has a so bad it's enjoyable kind of vibe br br where the film is let down is miss using a fairly decent budget the budget of around 10 million has not been well spent it's all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the <UNK> lack imagination the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse there are some good moments you have a car <UNK> through school <UNK> for example and a decent shootout at the beginning with plenty of destruction the rest of the <UNK> are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on <UNK> br br as for the cast hidden agenda <UNK> the best cast dolph has worked with in ages there was a good standard of actors for a <UNK> film this however has problems the actors are on the most part bad the bad guys are terrible but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex <UNK> plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters they all hate authority each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a <UNK> this movie is all about dolph though while this film is nowhere near his best it is nowhere near his worst it also marks a turning point in his career he is now back in good shape and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action dolph looks enthusiastic here he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man running from explosions in slow mo one liners and handling large weapons again in a movie like his older ones albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one it is good to see dolph looking <UNK> his films of the last 8 or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary and using <UNK> a lot he still does all the fights himself though but the new <UNK> dolph seems up for it br br overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode there's not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm
<START> one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious <UNK> is satisfying it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be <UNK> one of the characteristics of these <UNK> types is the <UNK> <UNK> that they the <UNK> are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their <UNK> of <UNK> i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie <UNK> the same <UNK> taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies
<START> <UNK> s and as lots of <UNK> some great characters fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the <UNK> pie franchise this feels like really old school it feels a bit like <UNK> for the <UNK> some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me br br whilst the original cast is all but gone except for one this movie i found really entertaining lets not get too excited you have to take it for the <UNK> teen comedy that it is but for what it is it excels the characters are likable and funny the girls are <UNK> than hell the fun and games are hilarious with some stuff i've never seen before in comedies they make me cringe but laugh at the same time br br so ignore the <UNK> and give this a run and see what you think don't expect the classic american pie but expect something that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so
<START> i can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad it's like the tv station are desperate for anything anything at all they're buried underneath a bunch of snow the electricity constantly flashes on and off yet magically there is a background light that stays constant where does all this fake light come from that and all that stupid <UNK> between the characters they seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to <UNK> ways to survive it tries to create that feel of <UNK> and people helping but because it's such bad directing and acting you will not your <UNK> <UNK> fix with this flick sorry i'm joining the negative <UNK> and i <UNK> that this is one of the worst movies ever
<START> i don't remember when i first heard about this movie but i rented it about six years ago and it still remains one of my favorite comedies i will admit you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music but if you are a rap fan even a casual one you will love the inside jokes and references one of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b and a h i still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it one of the best performances comes from larry scott who played nerd <UNK> in revenge of the <UNK> it is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a dvd release
<START> this could have been the gay counterpart to gone with the wind given its epic <UNK> but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs the characters are <UNK> dimensional and have no other development in the story there's actually no story either than looking for each other and kissing it's a shame that an interesting aesthetic <UNK> like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in <UNK> the psychology of its characters with some dignity and achieving true emotional <UNK> on top of that it pretends to be an art film by using the worst naive clichés of the cinematic <UNK> but anyway if someone can identify with its heavy <UNK> i guess that's fine
<START> fine performances and art direction do not a good movie make this movie is so grim and depressing i could feel absolutely no joy at the happy ending involving the union strike the attempts at humor involving <UNK> <UNK> are absolutely disastrous and any movie involving a baldwin brother already has a strike against it on a positive note lang is still one of america's great underrated actors he alone almost makes this worth keeping in the vcr i give this a 4
<START> a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap at least the music in spinal tap was good br br this is really a very sad case of hollywood <UNK> at it's worst a bunch of hollywood <UNK> bad musicians and producers create some <UNK> show so their kids can be in the spotlight oh please the <UNK> humor was even bad i hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids musicians actors and artists out there <UNK> their <UNK> to have success and this crap comes along br br help u all why wasn't gene simmons in it <UNK> taste in entertainment is going down the toilet
<START> i gave this movie such a high mark because it was really cute really funny all while being <UNK> i went to see this film when it was playing in the <UNK> area and it was the <UNK> of a great night out with friends the film is well written and well acted and though it does feel a bit like a sitcom rather then a movie that doesn't take away from the film you just don't find comedies like this anymore where you don't have to shock people to be funny the film centers around a <UNK> <UNK> that finds herself working for a young couple in need of help though at first she helps soon she adds more <UNK> to their lives then the couple <UNK> for things get further and further out of control until you'll have to see the banter had me laughing even after leaving the theater this film just put me in a good mood i can't wait until it is released on dvd because i want this movie in my collection
<START> generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs problem is nicholas cage there is no chemistry between he and cher and they are the central love story cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to <UNK> shifting accent and out of control body language cage simply never <UNK> into his role he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character cage keeps taking these roles perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self
<START> in 1979 i was a boy of 12 years old my parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood as a 12 year old boy this was the first time i saw boobs on television i will never forget the joy of those times racing <UNK> the total ass wipe with the <UNK> van the water bed the smoking of <UNK> the hot 70's chicks the <UNK> love in my chevy van song it was all so new to me a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for i own it and enjoy it about once a year when i watch this movie it makes me want to get my <UNK> with 4 <UNK> not in a <UNK> line go to the park and hunt down some babes with <UNK> hair truly great memories of young <UNK>
<START> i'm not a regular viewer of <UNK> but i do watch his show in glimpses and i think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time so naturally i'm going to watch this movie expecting to see jerry springer <UNK> first of all jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time the other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo farce about trailer trash jealousy incest and deception <UNK> <UNK> who looks hot as <UNK> is a trailer trash slut who sleeps with her <UNK> a very unusual looking chain smoking drunken michael <UNK> who finally <UNK> from his action hero persona the mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the jerry show that's right no springer and then we have a parallel story with an african american couple they take it to the jerry show the characters <UNK> blah blah <UNK> blah trash has rarely been this <UNK> i was wondering why the hell springer has millions of fans yet none of them checked out his movie well now it's totally obvious whether you love him or hate him you will hate this movie how can i explain it's a total mess of a motion picture if that's what you call it it's so badly edited with scenes that just don't connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce with seldom laughs br br my only positive note is a hot girl girl scene that's as <UNK> as it gets don't get me wrong the <UNK> pretty <UNK> but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on <UNK> program this disastrous farce seems extremely <UNK> br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> in the mid 1930s hollywood was <UNK> its confidence after the difficulties of the <UNK> transition although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look how they should be structured and how they should be acted the informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which <UNK> moments can convey story <UNK> the power images without ignoring the <UNK> of sound and dialogue br br this is not to say the informer is truly a <UNK> to the golden days of the <UNK> for one thing many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative and were <UNK> with title cards but what the informer has is the self <UNK> to <UNK> moments between dialogues to focus on reactions more than speeches and to let shots play out simply for atmosphere br br director john ford for all his <UNK> was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in <UNK> to how interested he was in the material if he thought a story was silly he just did it half <UNK> luckily the informer with its depiction of community honour working class life and most importantly irish setting was everything ford loved and the result is one of his finest works in it ford only really employs too kinds of shot the first is of places  the <UNK> streets <UNK> in <UNK> and darkness so their <UNK> depths cannot be seen <UNK> interiors where the walls and <UNK> seem to press in on us the second is of faces striking close ups against plain backgrounds usually without dialogue focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these people br br lead man victor mclaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him <UNK> performance does not look like much being as it is about 90 drunk act but the other 10 is heartfelt <UNK> as here and there his gypo nolan has what <UNK> refer to as a moment of clarity with such performances are oscars won mclaglen is backed by a spot on supporting cast among whom there are no weak <UNK> in particular it is nice to have donald meek and <UNK> <UNK> usually only seen in comic relief roles playing straight dramatic parts for once although <UNK> appearance does contain one or two jokes the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances their <UNK> to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of <UNK> to their part in this tragedy br br rko who produced the informer were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios thanks to this we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable anti hero at its centre which could easily have been a clunky over earnest mess instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world
<START> <UNK> la <UNK> al <UNK> is an awful movie this is only a <UNK> of scenes without a clear link acting is also very bad despite the presence of a good actor like <UNK> el <UNK> but something is really astonishing in this movie talking about sexuality <UNK> of women nude scenes are very rare in arab cinema even in this days i really <UNK> the director and the actors for their courage we want to see more of this style in egyptian movies but with better quality the reasons that led me to vote this film as an awful one are not only scenario and acting but also the lack of <UNK> this movie look like an amateur one we can see a lot of errors in the screen if you want a good arab movie <UNK> la <UNK> al <UNK> is not the one recommended but if you wish to encourage the <UNK> movies in all the arab world watch it and make your friends and your family do the same
<START> i saw this movie once late on a public tv station so i don't know if it's on video or not br br this is one of the baby <UNK> <UNK> that shirley temple did in the early 1930s it is hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this <UNK> little film which today might just be considered this side of kiddie porn br br shirley temple stars in a cast which probably has an average age of 5 they are all in <UNK> and are in a saloon which serves milk instead of alcohol the cash is in the form of <UNK> br br shirley playing a femme fatale <UNK> up to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her but shirley doesn't need really their <UNK> cash because her purse is full of ones from other men br br meanwhile a little black boy does a suggestive dance on a nearby table br br what a strange film <UNK> using <UNK> dialogue playing adult roles in a saloon who thought up this stuff any way
<START> <UNK> and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks at least folks who might do such a thing sit around and talk about film noir br br yet some of the best films of the genre out of the past the killers in a lonely place night and the city manage a level of <UNK> sophistication that <UNK> them beyond a moody catch phrase and its <UNK> of foreboding shadows <UNK> and femme <UNK> br br where the sidewalk ends a fairly difficult to find film the only copy in perhaps the best <UNK> video store in manhattan was a rough <UNK> from the <UNK> cable channel belongs in a category with these classics br br from the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective marc <UNK> <UNK> world and as the moments pass it <UNK> ever closer threatening <UNK> br br sure he's that familiar cop with a dark past but dana andrews gives dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems and yeah he's been <UNK> around suspects for too long and the newly promoted chief karl malden in a typically <UNK> and commanding outing is warning him for the last time br br yet dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now and boy didn't they had have it coming br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rats he <UNK> when that tough nut of a boss <UNK> him and rolls out all of the complaints the <UNK> has been receiving about <UNK> right hook the advice is for him to cool off for his own good but instead he takes matters into his own hands br br and what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before br br right away he's in deep with the cops the <UNK> his own partner <UNK> questionable involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has <UNK> to bring in like bogart in lonely place can he escape what he is br br when he has nowhere else to turn he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a <UNK> beauty the marvelous gene tierney who seems as if she can turn his <UNK> <UNK> existence into something worth coming home to br br the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping the group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high <UNK> the dialogue is snappy without <UNK> into dated parody fodder passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy br br and all of this top notch direction and acting isn't too slick or <UNK> to <UNK> the film's emotional hold gene <UNK> <UNK> soft focus beauty is used to great effect she shows herself to be an actress of considerable range and her gentle kind nature is as <UNK> here as is her <UNK> in leave her to heaven the scenes between tierney and <UNK> dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self destruction br br near the end of his rope cut <UNK> and exhausted dixon <UNK> his lot innocent people can get into terrible <UNK> too he says one false move and you're in over your head br br perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right with one slight shift in the wind one wrong decision or punch or most <UNK> due to factors you have no control over noir has always reflected the darkest fears brought them to the surface where the sidewalk ends does so in a realistic fashion br br one <UNK> pick of an aside this otherwise sterling film has a <UNK> poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn't seem out of place on mystery science theater how very odd br br but noir fans heck any movie fans who haven't seen this one are in for a terrific treat
<START> <UNK> beach is a real <UNK> <UNK> beach south of <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> in south australia it is also the name of an australian film that used the beach as a location br br <UNK> beach is <UNK> a romantic comedy this could be slightly misleading as it is not a <UNK> film nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense but it does have light hearted moments much as life itself there are also moments of sadness too it is also entirely shot at the <UNK> beach mentioned above and nudity runs throughout the length of film the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal and concentrate on the plot not the <UNK> amount of flesh br br simon and <UNK> michael allen and <UNK> <UNK> arrive by car at a beach side car park they take their <UNK> to the beach and while they are walking a voice over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is the rest of the film is an exploration of this framed by one complete day at the beach the basic story is of what happens to simon's love life but there are also many other characters <UNK> in several separate vignettes br br when they arrive at the beach both simon and <UNK> appear bored with each other <UNK> sees them as a <UNK> and <UNK> romantic couple simon is just bored with it all next we are introduced to <UNK> bonnie <UNK> lawrence paula <UNK> collins and jenny jennifer ross they are walking down the beach together discussing <UNK> chances of finding the <UNK> man aided by the <UNK> of a <UNK> that brought good luck to her grandmother however there are many more interesting people on the beach not all of them <UNK> and young part of the realism of this film br br to service the <UNK> <UNK> there is a <UNK> short <UNK> ice cream <UNK> with a van this is ben gary <UNK> who is a friend of simon and is also his <UNK> <UNK> i would think that this character is the main comic element it is hard to say though as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh <UNK> unless you were <UNK> male and very young <UNK> beach does have a major redeeming feature though and that is that it does not <UNK> too long on any one subject as the quality of acting is <UNK> the script is suspect and everything about <UNK> beach is cheap the lack of continuity is a positive <UNK> in fact there is something about this film not the nudity that i find appealing it is hard to define what it is but it could be something to do with its <UNK> and downright <UNK> attitude to <UNK> matters br br the camera work in <UNK> beach deserves a mention sometimes it is very good with some stunning static shots and <UNK> of the beach <UNK> and a sunset as nudity is a major factor in this film framing is an important aspect of the camera work there is no sense of <UNK> in the framing meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not <UNK> on <UNK> body parts this helps to ease any sense of viewer <UNK> from being within the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and makes the film more <UNK> not an easy task given the location for filming br br <UNK> beach is neither a <UNK> <UNK> for post <UNK> <UNK> charged males nor a <UNK> and <UNK> romance for under appreciated women <UNK> beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre the actors are not <UNK> in the <UNK> sense and are just <UNK> people that you would see on the beach anywhere it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a <UNK> <UNK> other than perhaps to <UNK> apart from the australian accent the filming could have been in any sunny country what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless cinema <UNK> and only australian cinema and other medium sized national cinemas could consider such a <UNK> option at the same time these medium sized cinemas have room for <UNK> in the quest for identity and a <UNK> is not going to damage their reputation too much it is always possible given that <UNK> beach is now a <UNK> item that the film might become <UNK> popular but it is very unlikely br br during this critique i have been sounding highly negative at times about <UNK> beach this is not the real position as i found the film very easy to watch i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people and problems the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday and a little low on spectacle this does it no harm in my view and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe and with french film in particular they rarely deal with major disasters or <UNK> but with the everyday hollywood is in direct opposition to this and rides the <UNK> of the hyper real action drama angst wave the pace too is much faster in hollywood but it is not reality <UNK> beach is not exactly <UNK> <UNK> either but it is on the right track even if it does ignore issues of multi <UNK> <UNK> gender <UNK> and so on that are of such importance in current cinema i am sure that you will either love or hate this film with little room for a middle ground br br
<START> this is the only movie i've seen prince in but it don't matter and i thought he was only great at singing boy was i wrong this is probably his best performance the music is great thats why it won the oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie or something like that now he has an oscar and <UNK> under his belt although the <UNK> gets in the way with the film just make sure no little kids or in the room there isn't to much to say without revealing the plot you should really go out and get this movie your collection isn't complete unless you got this movie in it what else could i possibly say except for go and get this movie now
<START> the movie opens upon julian <UNK> lying on his back a black <UNK> <UNK> blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it about two feet above him that was so provocative and i thought here we go a good vampire movie br br and then it died that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination it was slow <UNK> drivel thereafter i was vastly disappointed as my previous experience with <UNK> acting was quite enjoyable however this attempt was obviously <UNK> and the screenplay left a lot to be desired br br even julian <UNK> questionable performance could not begin to save this already <UNK> <UNK> of a movie br br it rates a 1 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i went into this movie expecting it to be really god awful and it was i really felt sorry for the star <UNK> cast kathy bates was a wonderful actress before she made this movie vince vaughn and paul <UNK> were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for <UNK> dad played by <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> of <UNK> fame amongst others had about one line br br the plot was predictable and all over the place and the humour was lacking however there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head on <UNK> with a train actually maybe the train would be better
<START> i didn't know willem dafoe was so hard up for bucks that he'd disgrace himself with such shocking <UNK> in this monstrosity hell i'll <UNK> that money that i was going to send to <UNK> if he's that desperate i have never seen such a pathetic and disgusting film for a long time who paid for this they are either pulling some tax <UNK> or insane a 5 year old would be ashamed of the plot and i'd rather get cancer than sit through more than the hour i suffered already everybody involved should be locked up for a year in the <UNK> wing of a third world prison avoid at all costs i'd give it minus 10 if possible unbelievable
<START> i saw this hot movie when it came out in 1986 it had a x rating for a brief scene involving <UNK> sex but played in mainstream theatres it was an art film supposedly it's the first film to ever show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene br br what i saw was a boring tale about a high school boy <UNK> <UNK> in love understandably with an older woman <UNK> <UNK> as has been mentioned before <UNK> is very beautiful with a good body but she also gave a very good performance <UNK> was to put it mildly pretty poor it's no wonder he never made another movie still despite the infamous sex scene which is explicit but pretty brief this a slow moving dull story which bored me silly the good acting by <UNK> only helped to a certain point mostly i was looking at my watch waiting <UNK> for it to end if it didn't have that sequence this movie would have been forgotten long ago dull and slow you can skip this one
<START> the best way for me to describe europa which is high on the list of my favourite films is the <UNK> that came from a companion after the film ended i didn't know films could be made like that entirely original in it's visual style it is one of the best examples of what cinema can be it's as far away from the master and coverage style of shooting as one can get perfectly <UNK> many layers of image sound effects props dialogue voice over performance editing lighting etc all equal none <UNK> despite hollywood's dialogue <UNK> cinema is not about dialogue nor is it about beautiful lighting action or music it works best when all the elements are on an equal <UNK> where only the <UNK> of those elements in the order or combination in which they are presented will communicate the idea <UNK> or eliminate the contribution of one element and the film has no meaning europa is what cinema should <UNK> to be
<START> burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions he'd show up party with his friends on film and take home a big paycheck it didn't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap br br no film <UNK> this more than <UNK> ace which makes <UNK> run look like a classic and <UNK> run ii look watchable save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here even the beautiful <UNK> anderson <UNK> it up so bad as a dumb blonde it's embarrassing br br if the thought of burt <UNK> it up with jim <UNK> and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won't be any worse
<START> judging from this film and the strong man made the same year i would not place harry <UNK> at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians there simply is not enough there perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but <UNK> himself by taking his first big <UNK> too seriously in any event all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men but he lacks the <UNK> skills of keaton and the <UNK> <UNK> of lloyd he also <UNK> his own persona by dressing and walking like <UNK> tramp character his <UNK> are <UNK> innocence <UNK> of approach and a tendency to under react to <UNK> by looking <UNK> <UNK> his eyes or touching his <UNK> lips with the tip of his <UNK> the comedy in <UNK> films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in <UNK> or <UNK> ways or with a minimum of <UNK> such as throwing rocks at an approaching <UNK> to drive it away <UNK> up a <UNK> building with a two by four or <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> a leg so that they roll under him in this story about the son of a <UNK> who joins a cross country walking race to <UNK> a rival <UNK> <UNK> he manages to win by sheer luck there is nothing here that hasn't been done far better by the big three
<START> the plot of this film is not strong at all lots of holes if you approach it as a car movie its not bad lots of great cars in this one the reason i like it is because i am from the area where this was filmed i get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in st cloud <UNK> and seeing how the town has changed since <UNK> its an interesting historical piece for us locals seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town i didn't know the director was from st cloud
<START> when i saw this movie circa 1979 it became the first movie that i ever walked out of in the middle there is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny and this misses every time although i can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie there was nothing original about any of the skits while i enjoy <UNK> humor where appropriate these skits were needlessly vulgar what was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as robin <UNK> first movie <UNK> on his new found fame in the <UNK> and <UNK> television series yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on screen
<START> this review may contain some spoilers br br the remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie gone in 60 seconds begins well actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well but even a big hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable for those who don't know the original plot had the thieves working as insurance <UNK> who would suspect them but even with a change to nearly every aspect of h b <UNK> original the remake is a very good movie until we get to the final chase scene the part of the <UNK> version that made it great the one in this version is watered down only 10 minutes and it <UNK> in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase where the original chase was very believable the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes my advice if you want to watch a classic car chase film fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake
<START> this film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts average montage scenes 30 somethings playing teenagers and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the new wave of modern classics as a viewer i came away from the film with the same sense of shock and awe as when i first saw the godfather in 1969 <UNK> <UNK> startling portrayal of the morally <UNK> judy was deserving of her <UNK> nomination which was well <UNK> stolen by ricky martin and restless <UNK> unfortunately the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original unlike the godfather series which got better with each installment and should <UNK> in <UNK> with godfather 4 eat my rage
<START> too bad neither the animals or eddie murphy had anything to say worth saying this movie is just bland br br children's movie well if you're trying to get them to take a <UNK> then maybe it's just 90 minutes of some eye <UNK> poor animal lip animation to <UNK> that aren't funny and the lip <UNK> makes the old godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison meanwhile eddie <UNK> <UNK> murphy <UNK> on with a <UNK> understated delivery that is painful to experience apparently he's trying to <UNK> his old manic persona but to what in short all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re imagining or whatever it is a town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff no really and <UNK> <UNK> can psycho <UNK> with them things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises br br rent the <UNK> movie or some old <UNK> bear cartoons
<START> this seems like two films one a dreary pretentious lengthy saga about an <UNK> <UNK> who is taken over by the parts he plays the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress shelley winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side she drops heavy hints about the need for connections her <UNK> in <UNK> and her desire to get into the <UNK> game i love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a <UNK> behind a curtain and her terrible <UNK> outfit of <UNK> revealing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> top br br do actors get oscars for shakespeare we know they oscars for <UNK> disabled people wearing a lot of <UNK> or pretending to be mad the shakespearean scenes which go on and on are embarrassing and dated and so are the <UNK> <UNK> scenes where tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice over br br by the way anthony john is not <UNK> he makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy when he quotes his father's advice he slips into a cockney accent
<START> yes be my love was mario <UNK> <UNK> to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by <UNK> who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant <UNK> and vocal lessons became the <UNK> caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood i used to <UNK> singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of <UNK> <UNK> ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful
<START> <UNK> film of four city <UNK> in crisis in <UNK> has become <UNK> with rural <UNK> each of four <UNK> face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging <UNK> trip on a river about to be replaced by a <UNK> when locals along the way decide to have their way with the <UNK> it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors each of the <UNK> is outstanding although voight gives the lead and strongest performance the rural scenery and culture is well captured including the breathtaking <UNK> <UNK> sequence i saw this on a date when it came out not exactly the perfect date movie although we both enjoyed it i sort of remember this as a break out dramatic performance for burt voight was already established not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed
<START> <UNK> the morning after his bachelor party paul is <UNK> by his mother in law to be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him unfortunately its a waitress from the bar and not his fiancée and suddenly she turns up everywhere the <UNK> booth at the <UNK> and at his parent in laws dinner and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex boyfriend had him followed and photographed it is not only about saving his wedding it is about survival br br comments actually much better than expected not the sweet romantic comedy i expected but something much funnier something with a little edge this movie wasn't afraid to take the jokes a little further and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy especially when his character is half <UNK> and deep in trouble as he is here and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia stiles and <UNK> blair and actually i thought <UNK> <UNK> did a nice part as the ex br br so more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good i enjoyed it very much br br 7 10
<START> laugh clown laugh released in <UNK> stars the legendary <UNK> <UNK> as a circus clown named <UNK> <UNK> has raised a <UNK> a young and beautiful loretta young to <UNK> and names her <UNK> <UNK> has raised the girl in the circus life and she has become an accomplished <UNK> while <UNK> gives his usual great performance i could not get past the fact that <UNK> now well into middle age has the <UNK> for the young <UNK> although he is not her <UNK> father he has raised her like a daughter that kind of <UNK> factor <UNK> throughout the film <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> affections with a young and handsome <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> clearly falls for the young man but feels guilt about <UNK> <UNK> out of loyalty not romantic love the whole premise of the film is ridiculous and i find it amazing that no one in the film tells <UNK> what a stupid old fool he is being until he reveals it himself at the end the film is noteworthy only because of loretta young who would go on to have a great career while i adore <UNK> brilliance as an actor this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy
<START> i'm a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show and i really enjoyed this flick i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters br br it's funny hearing people <UNK> against this movie with excuses like lame plot and it's much <UNK> than the show does anyone remember the <UNK> of the humor in the pilot episode daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably <UNK> half the kids in the <UNK> the only reason it was <UNK> up is because it changed to and earlier time <UNK> br br and as far as the plot goes it was the perfect dukes plot in fact as a remake it probably stays <UNK> to the source material than any tv show that has <UNK> to the big screen br br while sean william scott and johnny <UNK> aren't exactly like their small screen versions they do a great job and work very well together i wasn't too keen on <UNK> boss <UNK> though and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff <UNK> in the movie <UNK> is a little scary br br and who didn't have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of <UNK> and the back roads of hazzard br br folks allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia <UNK> and car chases you won't be sorry it's just a great dumb movie
<START> i had the misfortune to watch this rubbish on sky cinema max in a cold winter night i am not a big fan of horror movies because most of them are just trash this one is even worse it is one of the dumbest pieces of crap i've ever seen in my whole life horror movie yes there are horrible things in this the acting the script and the special effects gosh i laughed at this ludicrous attempt to make a flick for 90 minutes actually had it been a comic movie i would've given it a 5 don't you even think about renting this unless you want to mock at the producers br br vote 2 out of 10 didn't vote one because it made me laugh all the time
<START> once again i took a chance and rented this bag of crap billed as a horror flick there wasn't one scene not one that was even remotely <UNK> not one sure there was some nudity but all the lesbian action got a little old i guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie's saving grace and dan what an annoying ass bag right from the beginning i knew i was in for it when good ol' dan first spoke and he was suppose to be <UNK> what a laugh all in all this movie is dreadfully awful how in the hell do movies like this get made if you want a movie with a few thrills in it don't rent this one this movie is about as thrilling as the <UNK>
<START> i found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that the basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions deliberate and otherwise effect the lives of the others the film's premise holds great promise but i feel it fails to deliver on its promise too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it as a result i never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally by the end of the movie i had a so what attitude about all of them a stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great but as it stands it is merely so so
<START> what's this a canadian produced zombie flick that i have never heard of before a <UNK> works on the body of a recently deceased young man this allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there basically he and friends went to a cemetery on friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly <UNK> cut back to the <UNK> where our dead body comes back to life and kills the <UNK> and owner who gets his eyes popped out the final wtf shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming i'm not crazy amazingly he has his <UNK> back br br running a <UNK> <UNK> minutes this is certainly one <UNK> in zombie cinema it feels a lot longer but put me in some kind of <UNK> where i couldn't stop watching the film also has one of those if you see this image turn away from the screen gags it is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater <UNK> and when he pops up only twice the blood begins to flow the scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period there is a great <UNK> where a zombie chops off a girl's right hand with a <UNK> but when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to <UNK> on it is a left hand
<START> this movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness so many scenes reminded me too <UNK> of my own life experiences this movie was the man's version of <UNK> <UNK> it depicts both <UNK> and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through it also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are god br br someone told me it was funny no way i say it is sick humor at best br br the movie is so intense and depressing that my son and i had to leave the room the best use for this movie is for people who don't understand mental illness or don't believe what we families actually do live through
<START> this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of <UNK> if they can bother br br this film is even worse than white chicks little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby story is awful considering it was written by six people the idea still wouldn't be too bad though if it was original and not a rip off of a cartoon episode it has funny moments but some of them are way over done and some are just stupid the acting was very very bad so was the directing anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves it is racist and very offensive to <UNK> i mean instead of showing sympathy to them the film makers make fun of them it really <UNK> me how they do it they see <UNK> being just like babies and for a character who is a midget pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family that is its lame excuse for showing something like that it just was not worth it don't watch this film it is a huge waste of time and money
<START> <UNK> in the twin cities we have a station that shows a big bad movie monday through friday <UNK> <UNK> was a film with carrie fisher called she's back about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house <UNK> <UNK> comes back to haunt her husband she wants him to seek revenge on her killers hence she's back and she won't let him rest until he does so she <UNK> him endlessly and the viewers too this movie is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen hey i like bad movies though my <UNK> movie is <UNK> i was really shaking my head throughout the whole film wondering who thought this would be a good idea for a movie <UNK> is just so annoying the plot is silly the acting is bad the story well you get my drift anyway if you wanna see a really bad movie really really bad movie check this one out you won't be disappointed <UNK>
<START> but i doubt many were running to see this movie or some came running out of the cinema okay that's a bit harsh br br the film starts in an unintentionally comical way frankie boy comes back to his hometown after many years this already <UNK> of clichés and the whole town is <UNK> by his arrival he is talked about everyone wants to talk to him and every woman he meets <UNK> with him like there's no tomorrow even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankie boy a little longer even his pretty niece wants a piece of him sounds like one of those laughable mike hammer episodes where every single female wants <UNK> <UNK> and like <UNK> <UNK> frankie boy is anything but a good looking woman's wet dream in real life someone like sinatra without the fame wouldn't get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as <UNK> but in this hollywood movie it's the other way around <UNK> is absolutely nuts about frankie boy but he couldn't care less sinatra plays his cool <UNK> much too often in his movies and it is rarely credible dean martin is kind of miscast he isn't miscast as a card player but rather because of the accent which simply doesn't suit him <UNK> is charming as ever but she plays a caricature and this <UNK> on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen it all before movies and cheap novels frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women and he couldn't care less about his writing which predictably eventually <UNK> recognition martin is a sleazy but friendly card player <UNK> is the dumb but very likable bimbo <UNK> blond love interest is a <UNK> literary expert <UNK> brother is the successful guy who married into his wife's business and has a lousy marriage and so on clichés br br the story contains a couple of <UNK> which are a little too far fetched for my taste frankie just happens to <UNK> into his niece in a locale his niece just happens to be <UNK> away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time and then there is the awful stupid ending br br in it a drunk guy bent on killing frankie boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places the place is utterly crowded with the typical noise and chaos plus it's happening in the evening and yet the guy somehow finds frankie in spite of being drunk as a <UNK> and shoots at him but guess who he kills <UNK> she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie a cliché which comic book writers might cringe at this utterly pathetic over dramatic and annoying ending certainly cannot please any even semi intelligent viewer and this happens on the same day that <UNK> and sinatra got married the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life how else is the writing of this movie to be explained there is even a card game in which a <UNK> ensues with frankie martin vs some cliché caricatures out of the writer's vivid imagination it was like a damn western suddenly another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring <UNK> <UNK> bimbo and pretty much ignored <UNK> as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds <UNK> to be too dumb for him just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too low class for her there is a certain <UNK> and disdain to be <UNK> in the script regarding <UNK> <UNK> is treated as worthless by everyone while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual the ironic truth is that the <UNK> character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual her behaviour comments and opinions are mostly clichéd silly confused pretentious and primitive at least <UNK> character knows that she <UNK> is dumb there is another irony that i didn't fail to notice sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story much like the writer of this movie and that's why he came up with the corny crappy finale br br the film basically has a solid cast and the photography is nice but the script though sometimes okay relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality based characters and events br br if you're interested in reading my <UNK> of shirley <UNK> and other hollywood <UNK> contact me by e mail
<START> this is one of the best films we watched in my high school spanish class if you are a fan of the opera this film will strongly entertain you of course the dancing is wonderful watching these amazing dancers moving to the music of <UNK> is well worth checking out
<START> i couldn't believe i spent 14 00 on this the only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore the dubbing was worse than any i have ever experienced it looks like it was shot with a vhs camcorder i think every <UNK> was spent on the special effects because there was a whole lot of blood and body parts everywhere its one of the worst movies i have ever seen but i do have to acknowledge the <UNK> gore that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and unbelievable
<START> i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i'm working oh i'm sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like <UNK> home movie and i don't think more than 100 was spent making it total crap who let's this stuff be released
<START> a <UNK> and thoroughly false vision of <UNK> from a middle class artist with a comfortable upbringing it is clear that the writer director never suffered <UNK> directly and certainly has no personal experience of it if you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers have no anger no fear no frustration etc all the characters live <UNK> the day by carrying pranks <UNK> jokes they do never look for work the do almost never experience <UNK> or anguish etc living on the <UNK> is just about like a summer vacation from school ridiculous specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of ken <UNK> etc
<START> olivier <UNK> stars as jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single <UNK> <UNK> out a mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that it's laughable bad acting bad plot and bad fight choreography make angel town a turkey
<START> well i finally saw it i didn't go when it first came out because well frankly i was afraid afraid of how bad it might be or how disappointing while not as bad as menace and better than <UNK> it wasn't particularly memorable or satisfying br br i was 11 years old when i saw star wars i still remember sitting in the theater from the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience i'll never forget a timeless story of the bored farm boy who just knows he was meant for more saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil menace while being <UNK> by the wise wizard the rogue pirate and the various comic relief all in a space opera setting br br and that's not to <UNK> lucas for using an old formula it's an old formula precisely because it works and to his credit he gave it new twists that made it very special br br then came empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time the great villain vader was <UNK> father wow no one saw that coming of course i'm convinced neither did lucas till it showed up in the screenplay go back and watch star wars again knowing what you know now particularly in light of the first three episodes see if it really <UNK> br br which brings me to the problem i have revenge is an entertaining movie tremendous effects plenty of action some good fighting scenes but a movie still lives or dies on its plot the story it is telling oh certainly really good acting can save a weak plot but a weak plot coupled with bad acting that's a burden no director can overcome certainly not one as bad as i'm forced to realize george lucas is the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors liam neeson natalie portman samuel jackson br br spoilers ahead the plot oh my understand he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden one too much for him to overcome br br first we have the sheer <UNK> of the background we have <UNK> being found as a child on <UNK> the product of a <UNK> miracle birth the chosen one well this detail never gets remotely explained indeed the closest explanation is <UNK> observation that maybe they were wrong oh well okay then our mistake br br now this same <UNK> turns out to be the creator of <UNK> hey what a coincidence that is and he'll come back to <UNK> and never know he was from there wow how about that testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there eh george anyway we have this <UNK> kid moody <UNK> whining young adult who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history the great tragedy of darth <UNK> the good guy who falls from grace only to finally achieve redemption in the end br br how pray tell does this happen why he has a dream that his wife will die in <UNK> now sure he lives in a star <UNK> civilization that treats gravity like we treat <UNK> but does it occur to the dark one to be to maybe check with a <UNK> cause maybe just maybe this futuristic society might can do something about this problem why no the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to <UNK> br br well of course he does br br <UNK> br br how can lucas expect us to watch such <UNK> and be moved by it how can anyone expect us to care hell why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place i wanted <UNK> to kill him not because he was evil but because he was <UNK> stupid br br oh by the way <UNK> finally dies in <UNK> why well they don't know the doctor who is a <UNK> and himself <UNK> of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced offers only the conclusion of she's lost the will to live well oh okay of course she has maybe it finally <UNK> on her what a <UNK> she was sleeping with br br but here we are we have <UNK> present for all this he knows of the birth of luke and leia knows who their father is and knows what happens to them knows also the role of both <UNK> and <UNK> and yet in several years as luke approaches <UNK> and shows up with <UNK> and <UNK> curiously <UNK> mind is wiped but not <UNK> why stating i think these <UNK> belong to you <UNK> who knows that the <UNK> <UNK> was constructed by the one he believed to be the chosen one and apprentice to the emperor himself and who just happened to be built on this very planet says strange i don't recall <UNK> any <UNK> br br oh good grief br br lucas simply made this up as he went along once he introduced vader as <UNK> father sadly the story began spinning out of control because he didn't know what the story was the plot of episodes 1 3 is simply incomprehensible nothing <UNK> did made any rational sense at all and none of this ties into the story he originally told in star wars br br it's an <UNK> and it looks it br br i can't give this movie a high rating it reminds me of triple x a fun film to watch but entirely forgettable star wars will stand in my mind forever thankfully this one and the two <UNK> it will soon fade
<START> possible mild spoiler br br as i watched the first half of guilty as sin i <UNK> t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a <UNK> edge joe <UNK> clone from the mid 80s it starts with a murder and it s left for the audience to <UNK> is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney but halfway through the film shows its early 90s <UNK> by turning into a lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client type film which ends in a ridiculous manner and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect br br this is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 angry men
<START> king's <UNK> mines brings us patrick <UNK> playing allan <UNK> who has spent a lot of time in africa but decides it is time to return to england and be a father to his son he finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit in comes alison <UNK> playing elizabeth whose father is in africa and being held by an african tribe for <UNK> of the map <UNK> father had sent her elizabeth seeks out <UNK> to take her back to africa to find her father br br there is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with <UNK> and elizabeth and of course there are some enemies russians who want the map also br br the movie holds your attention until the end patrick once again plays a <UNK> handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion loss and despair the rugged silent good man anger and strength in king <UNK> minds his character actually smiles a few times i would really like to see patrick <UNK> in a relaxed live loving story again one in which he doesn't have to <UNK> his jaws and be quite so strong maybe a little dancing would help but this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it
<START> extreme <UNK> home edition is yet another <UNK> <UNK> so called <UNK> <UNK> and out for ratings show that abc has had the time to put together br br i understand the troubles that these families go through for that i am sorry but wouldn't you think that putting four wide screen <UNK> <UNK> three flat screen <UNK> computers an <UNK> pool taking up half of a backyard and <UNK> full of expensive designer clothing is a bit too excessive for any family sure these families have been through a lot sure they deserve <UNK> things that what they had previously had br br but honestly the things that <UNK> <UNK> and his crew put into these houses are enough to suit an entire neighborhood br br another thing that really <UNK> me about this show is how <UNK> and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family or the family's condition telling a wheelchair bound person that he or she is <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> really does get old after a while that may sound rude but believe me watch this show and you'll see what i mean br br all in all this show is overrated if you want to watch it go ahead this comment is just a heads up for what you'd be watching
<START> in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and <UNK> if you know what i did last friday the 13th valentine fails why did people like halloween because it was original new and went beyond anything that's ever been done why did they like scream because at least it made sense valentine is just a stupid slasher flick that has hardly any gore what so ever the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it's not funny and the moment the killer comes on screen you know who it is it's just <UNK> predictable the teen slasher genre is dead get over it br br 0 out of 10
<START> now it would be some sort of cliché if i began with the bit about the title so i'll wait on that first this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in <UNK> and break <UNK> then i realized it this is a movie with a message that message is beat kids and things like this won't happen things like what you ask things like a giant <UNK> monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical kill the monster <UNK> fashion now as promised blue monkey has nothing blue in it nor any <UNK> of any kind now it <UNK> like i was cheated or anything the picture on the cover had a giant bug <UNK> idiot thing on the front chasing some screaming <UNK> that kinda happened but i wanted apes having just enjoyed most extreme <UNK> a few nights before half drunk on <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> mind you i was in the mood for more monkey <UNK> 80's style not so much if you like snow <UNK> apes or blue things this movie is not for you if you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids rent this
<START> first saw this half a lifetime ago on a black and white tv in a small <UNK> village and thought it was hilarious now having seen it for the second time so much later i don't find it hilarious i don't find anything hilarious anymore but this is a witty and light hearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and i thoroughly enjoyed it br br it's 1945 and fred macmurray is a <UNK> who's dying to get into one of the armed forces he <UNK> a <UNK> in the <UNK> he's managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes ho hum right but though the introduction is no more than okay the fantasies are pretty lively macmurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army <UNK> and he is <UNK> along with <UNK> soldiers into a particularly warm and <UNK> <UNK> where june <UNK> and joan leslie are wearing lots of <UNK> <UNK> or whatever they are and <UNK> <UNK> washington sends macmurray to spy on the enemy red <UNK> german speaking <UNK> not brits the <UNK> are <UNK> into a <UNK> and singing a very amusing drinking song <UNK> the virtues of the <UNK> where the white wine is <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> is <UNK> and the yellow hair is <UNK> and the <UNK> are <UNK> and the <UNK> steps are <UNK> something like that the characterizations are fabulous as good as <UNK> <UNK> best otto preminger is the suspicious and sinister <UNK> general you know <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> to 1 against you but <UNK> are not afraid br br i can't go on too long with these fantasies but they're all quite funny and so are the lyrics when he wishes he were in the navy macmurray winds up with <UNK> and the fantasy is presented as grand opera don't you know that <UNK> west meant a <UNK> expensive investment and who do you suppose provides the means but <UNK> queen of queens when they sight the new world someone remarks that it looks great i don't care what it looks like <UNK> <UNK> but that place is going to be called <UNK> br br anyway everything is finally <UNK> out though the genie by this time is quite drunk and macmurray winds up in the marine <UNK> with the right girl br br i've made it sound too cute maybe but it is cute the kids will enjoy the <UNK> of smoke and the magic and the corny love story the adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story who are the <UNK> unless they happen to be college <UNK> in which case they might want to stick with the <UNK> and say wow awesome
<START> well easily my favourite tv series ever call me a walking mail cliché but include violence mafia sex gambling drugs etc on a show and you're already winning points on in my book combine all that with acting that <UNK> anything you've ever seen on the small screen add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind and a few brains a long the way and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with br br above all stand two actors james gandolfini as tony soprano and edie <UNK> as his wife <UNK> as for gandolfini he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express if you haven't seen him as tony yet see it now br br i can go on and on and on about every character in the show the psychological brilliance the gripping scenes etc but you wouldn't be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more
<START> i had high hopes for this movie the theater monologue is great and <UNK> <UNK> is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies br br i am a fan of a lot of <UNK> movies but this movie is bad it's completely unbelievable that actors who are <UNK> are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers the <UNK> games were hideous and over the top nothing about the film seemed real to me the ending was way too <UNK> ex <UNK> for me br br i am very disappointed and think i wasted an hour and a half of my life
<START> three flash backs introduce the main characters abu <UNK> and the princess who will interact with ahmad three are the songs each linked to those same characters three times does ahmad <UNK> the absolute word <UNK> in his <UNK> of love to the princess answering her three questions at their first of three <UNK> so strong is the impression he causes that the princess will resist the three attempts by <UNK> to <UNK> her by three <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and memory <UNK> yet <UNK> owns what he describes as the three <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> over a woman the whip the power and the sword three is the number of flying <UNK> the mechanical horse the genie and the the genie and the magic carpet the genie offers three wishes to abu at their first of three encounters three times does the genie laugh loud in the mountain <UNK> and three are his <UNK> about human <UNK> before he <UNK> abu <UNK> three obstacles in the temple of dawn armed guards giant spider and giant <UNK> three are the <UNK> of justice the magical eye that shows abu the future the magical carpet that <UNK> him just in time to save ahmad and the princess and the bow and arrow to <UNK> <UNK> there's magic in the number three and there is magic in this movie
<START> when i saw commercials for this i was thinking no what has nick at <UNK> done because it was taking up fresh prince <UNK> well i still love the fresh prince but george lopez is a surprisingly good show i love how not stereotypical benny is carmen is a pretty good character its really funny to see how stupid and <UNK> she can be sometimes i feel bad for the guy who plays max he looks much younger then he actually is but max is a fun character and acted well and yeah angie is a little stereotypical but she has her funny moments ha ha george does have a big head <UNK> but he can be really good too funny show it definitely should be on more often then home improvement
<START> i <UNK> grand canyon earlier this year when i set out to <UNK> a ten best list of the 1990's i first saw the film when i was 17 years old how did i hear about it it was reviewed and recommended highly by <UNK> ebert in 1991 and i eventually caught it on video a year later br br it's a great film a powerful film a healing film about the power of listening truly listening to one another i've seen it six times now and it entertains and <UNK> me with every subsequent viewing but why the poor reviews for this movie <UNK> movie guide gives it two out of four too melodramatic too much coincidence too sappy are the expressions that i read the most yes there is melodrama in this story and yes there is a lot of coincidence too but it delivers with an intensity and force that seems <UNK> for all of the plot that exists in grand canyon such as drive by shootings a police chase an <UNK> a love affair a woman's discovery of a baby in the <UNK> another shooting a near accident by a new driver and <UNK> advice from a homeless man this movie wins because of the smart performances by kevin kline steve martin mary <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> danny glover and jeremy <UNK> it also succeeds because of lawrence <UNK> <UNK> direction and writing you know that this isn't just another movie when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film that involves kevin kline being <UNK> by four black <UNK> danny glover plays a <UNK> truck driver who <UNK> the kline character but not before he gets <UNK> too by the leader of the bunch listen to the dialogue as the kid suggests to glover are you afraid of me because of me or because i have a gun br br grand canyon is filled with one <UNK> scene after another steve martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer who has a change of heart and then a subsequent change of mind i think his character is a warning that the good can carry us forward that <UNK> is a virtue but one that we must fight for constantly rather than depend upon br br i fear that grand canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non new releases at the video store but with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents i <UNK> with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it grand canyon is something special if you loved <UNK> another movie with a big ensemble about deep <UNK> themes you'll love grand canyon too
<START> i read so many comments that i too shared about remembering this movie and wanting so badly to see it again but i didn't know the name of the movie thankfully because of doing a search and finding the title on this site i read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie i remembered i then did a search and did find the movie and was so thrilled to be able to watch the movie once more 40 years later because of this site and your comments you helped me and so i want to thank all of you i want to share how i was able to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well it was on the vhs version of wonderful world of disney's call it courage which contained 2 movies the second one being the legend of the boy and the eagle it touched me now as much as it did 40 years ago and now i own my own copy of it i think it is only available on vhs i found it on ebay and i have seen several copies of it there enjoy it i know i did br br it is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he took care of when it was time to sacrifice the eagle the boy set the eagle free because he couldn't allow it to be killed after the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after <UNK> the eagle the eagle too saved the boy's life and more than that taught him how to survive the <UNK> that the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so moving and the filming was really remarkable what a wonderful era this was i have never seen anything come even close to this movie
<START> this movie is really genuine and random it's really hard to find movies like it in <UNK> of movies now in hollywood i really enjoy watching this movie i bought its dvd <UNK> this week and i've watched it for 4 times i love the <UNK> accent of paz it s just really cute as she is and her acting and <UNK> are so funny and natural br br my movie taste might be really different from others but i have to say i really love this movie the simple is the best br br i've learned something more about life from this movie well or at least <UNK> life life is really random sometimes u meet someone they pass by your life and be your friends <UNK> and u don't spend so much time with them maybe just a while but u enjoy that <UNK> with them and then u and them will never meet each other again but the time u are together is really unforgettable just keep those moments in your mind as grateful and nice memories br br this movie might be cheap in the making price but its meanings are totally not cheap i rarely can learn anything from movies but this is an exception
<START> i also saw this amazingly bad piece of anime at the london sci fi festival if you have to watch this thing do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers you may then <UNK> some enjoyment from it br br i found the dialogue hilarious <UNK> in my mind is the introduction of <UNK> the animation is awful it is badly designed and badly executed it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind br br there's nothing else to say really this film is a failure on every level
<START> i watched lion king more times that all my friends put <UNK> having a baby sister you know how it is by now i <UNK> both the plot and the lines after lion king 2 came out i was like ok well let me see the second one was significantly weaker then i saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1 2 i was like ok there we go again after watching the 1 1 2 i was like wow all my expectations for <UNK> were broken a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that <UNK> will apply here 100 br br i <UNK> recommend seeing the cartoon
<START> <UNK> mcdowell is beautiful as the 40 ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a <UNK> falling out with 2 long time best <UNK> br br seeing a <UNK> gold <UNK> in the sincere young man the girl friends dead set on <UNK> this silly relationship go over and beyond the call of duty in helping out their friend who obviously is <UNK> by this <UNK> <UNK> game br br a short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous far fetched no longer covers it without these unbelievable scenes there may have been hope for a sweet love story instead all the viewer is left with is an <UNK> shaking of head these things just don't happen without giving away cliff <UNK> details i warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film most like me will be very disappointed on a scale of 1 to 10 this one ranks a weak 4 with me there is much better material out there this one isn't worth your time
<START> for everyone who expects a traditional superhero movie it might be an unpleasant surprise it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie it focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a greek tragedy whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow br br that's because <UNK> like each superhero takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it <UNK> becomes an outlaw while on the run he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him br br as you can see the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram <UNK> <UNK> everything happens very slowly however when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on it's all over but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and <UNK> action what is more important here is the outcome of <UNK> actions which are mostly very <UNK> the score is very <UNK> which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it br br is the film worth it that is a question really difficult to answer i don't think that this experience <UNK> me so very much but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again mostly due to the atmosphere which is really dense but not <UNK> because all the time <UNK> and <UNK> have hope after all they're young people who have all their lives to live so no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight <UNK> tune when they are together
<START> i like monster movies generally even if they are implausible and silly but its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly and tries to take itself seriously all at the same time like in a really posh kind of way br br while the idea is somewhat factual like <UNK> are known for killing great white sharks its really hard to find it scary when i can't help but just see an angry <UNK> destroying stuff especially that one scene where some building <UNK> cause of the <UNK> doing and while it explodes the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like i was watching a show at sea world with fireworks plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they're going to happen on top of that it takes a few <UNK> at jaws its like hey look we're being factual and we can come up with better reasons why the <UNK> is attacking br br yes you are ignoring your outrageous ups in logic of course but jaws had one thing your movie doesn't its scary yes its implausible yes its somewhat outrageous but quite frankly factual or not a killer shark is not close to being as scary as a great white and the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more even jaws the revenge is scarier than this
<START> i have to finish watching a movie once i start regardless of how bad it is this movie was <UNK> to sit through the <UNK> bullets the reporter with ninja like moves the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent <UNK> the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just horrible like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends apartment and goes from what the heck are you doing in here holding a bat to hey you're cute wanna in like 1 2 seconds just bad save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids or dog
<START> you've been <UNK> and beaten up in <UNK> by my harsh statements about femme fatale guns <UNK> <UNK> movies now comes another breed in disappointing <UNK> ninja movies many of these i've seen before and let me tell you they aren't all that's <UNK> up to be they usually don't stick to the point this among all others suffers from no originality what's a ninja got to do with <UNK> a nuclear holocaust in russia and isn't this supposed to be a martial arts movie too does plenty of <UNK> sound like an incredible action movie to you is blood the number one reason to love this to death will you waste some of your hard earned cash over a lady singing in her see through tank top the answers to these important questions are found in the ninja mission which should be in the martial arts section of your video store for even more nonsense ninja fun try checking out those <UNK> ho movies put out by <UNK> world you get what you deserve and that's a promise recommended only for hardcore ninja <UNK>
<START> actor paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling dark and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic paxton himself who <UNK> his two sons into <UNK> in savage <UNK> murders claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but demons and that they have been selected by god to destroy these demons this is all told in flashback by one of the sons now grown up matthew <UNK> to skeptical fbi agent powers <UNK> br br hard to automatically forget this film better than most serial killer features it's a <UNK> and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks paxton <UNK> barely shows any blood at all until near the end well acted by all especially the two child actors jeremy <UNK> of the recent peter pan and matt <UNK> of spy kids 2 and domestic <UNK> the only reason i <UNK> any points at all is because i can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach in any event it's an <UNK> thriller with a decent script br br 8 10
<START> andy hardy meets <UNK> 1940 is the <UNK> <UNK> film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into characters andy hardy mickey rooney and judge hardy lewis stone were going to be front and center the rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their <UNK> the series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in br br lewis stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of judge hardy in a sympathetic manner the rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do mickey rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning <UNK> <UNK> reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way even after he returned as a veteran of world war ii service in love laughs at andy hardy 1946 his reaction to any <UNK> <UNK> was the same juvenile br br in this film it is clearly illustrated andy gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved this screen writing device was known as the <UNK> <UNK> a means of <UNK> a poorly written scenario maybe it was less mickey <UNK> fault then the director and the writers most likely george b <UNK> had directed one too many and a <UNK> hand was needed too control <UNK> <UNK> to see our <UNK> of the entire series go to you're only young once <UNK>
<START> on steve <UNK> show he's <UNK> he doesn't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn't even what i would call a movie i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he's just saying <UNK> this is one nasty bloke ' and looking straight into the camera he put his face in the camera too much and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn't you expect him to be dead and <UNK> had the worst acting i'd ever seen like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says <UNK> she didn't sound scared or anything it was just <UNK> i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid
<START> you know a movie will not go well when john carradine <UNK> a k a reads the script plot synopsis over his character's funeral <UNK> a mere 5 minutes into the movie the narration is his character's last will testament it <UNK> that his estate be divided amongst his 4 children and servants the children shall split <UNK> million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the <UNK> if all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants to be <UNK> they must live in the family estate for a week it sounds like the typical plot of a reality show br br there is little subtext as to the nature of the <UNK> they are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog from the opening voice over by john carradine you expect this movie will lead to a <UNK> cat and mouse game with a twist ending br br that journey is painfully slow and pointless we <UNK> through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing <UNK> the <UNK> of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between <UNK> <UNK> wearing men constant <UNK> misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux german <UNK> the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and <UNK> of dramatic overacting this all inevitably leads to the expected <UNK> ending you will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone share children share br br celluloid <UNK>
<START> just saw the movie this past weekend i am upset and disappointed with it basically the movie tells you that immigrants the ones from former soviet union especially come to this country bring everyone they can with them from the old country and <UNK> and take over what americans have been working for which is a very wrong way of looking at <UNK> and a much worse way of telling people about it that's the main thing another thing the overall writing directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs the actors did pretty well but it wasn't up to them save this bunch of crap a few jokes were funny but most were bad and cheesy couldn't wait to get out of the theater want my money back
<START> this film is as good as it is difficult to find the film's hero and writer and director is simon <UNK> a man with an agenda he creates a fake magazine just to have the authority to interview the <UNK> of los angeles the actors the models the musicians who believe that their own <UNK> doesn't smell with clever dialog <UNK> succeeds in doing this sure the budget for this film was probably what he paid for a used car but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well any person who can <UNK> edward <UNK> 'the <UNK> in the reflection of a silver <UNK> at a local coffee house should be nominated for some type of award give this film a chance and listen to what it says because they have been making the same car since 1986 it's called 'the car ' bravo <UNK> bravo
<START> i won't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as i'm concerned it isn't really a movie to start with just a <UNK> <UNK> mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of <UNK> the whole mess together and call it a boogeyman sequel literally 80 of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor the boogeyman a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get actress <UNK> <UNK> original character's name <UNK> right and to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are 0 out of 10 and i wish <UNK> rating system went that low the most <UNK> and blatant attempt to rip off people's money i've even seen you have been warned
<START> normally i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour <UNK> with imdb just to get it off my chest br br you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a <UNK> bet well this movie was just terrible it is <UNK> on impossible to suspend disbelief i tried really i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn't let me br br timberlake should stick to music what a dreadful performance no presence as an actor no character can't blame everything on justin the movie also <UNK> a dreadful plot badly timed editing its definitely an f br br after seeing this i have to wonder what really <UNK> actors i mean surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part did he not see how poor it was what then could <UNK> him to take the part money of course acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work br br ll cool j is a great actor he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script br br meanwhile the audience goes what the hell is going on here you expect me to believe this crap br br in short apart from justin a great <UNK> badly executed very disappointing
<START> matt <UNK> is back from the dead for a third go round although i'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for <UNK> <UNK> cop fans <UNK> who died in the last flick is <UNK> through voodoo and is now hot on the trail of several <UNK> involved in the shooting of a fellow officer <UNK> is very fond of i missed part of this early <UNK> low budget <UNK> but it was pleasing to see <UNK> <UNK> up the body count in various gruesome ways problem is the overall film is pretty static and <UNK> simply ain't jason or freddy the interest <UNK> pretty fast even with that grand b movie master robert <UNK> as a doctor who ends up with his brains <UNK> stick with the first film in the series which is funny and scary and exciting all at the same time
<START> i realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always <UNK> that is the only positive thing i can say about this truly horrid adaptation br br have you read <UNK> blood ' it's an amazing book <UNK> <UNK> wrote about the south as no one else has she was a <UNK> herself a <UNK> catholic and a remarkably gifted writer in her first novel she <UNK> together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith doubt and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising <UNK> the characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south but i can assure you that such people do exist not only do they exist they are human beings with families feelings and concerns like anyone else <UNK> intentions were so often misunderstood she was not <UNK> these backwoods <UNK> she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called <UNK> even in the most violent <UNK> and <UNK> of circumstances to read <UNK> <UNK> is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom finally it is to think long and hard about our <UNK> and <UNK> our entire world view br br none of this comes through in john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like adaptation none it is a farce a bad farce the entire film is <UNK> with a <UNK> that turns the stomach the acting is poor the southern accents are fake and insulting the filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious <UNK> ms <UNK> intense <UNK> are reduced to sight gags and cheap amateur theatre the soundtrack is a mixture of <UNK> silliness and <UNK> <UNK> style <UNK> <UNK> that doesn't fit the story or even the movie i was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out truly truly terrible br br as an aside i do not agree with ms <UNK> religious views and while i was raised in the deep south years ago i made my way north and have not looked back but the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals like every other place on earth and the cartoonish mockery with which <UNK> and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive if you're into being offended which i am not then this movie most definitely crosses the line br br i don't like to talk crap about an <UNK> work john huston was a man that i did not know and i'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker to which his respected place in film history <UNK> my views are clearly <UNK> by having read and loved <UNK> <UNK> work so i don't claim to be coming from any other perspective maybe as a stand alone film it works for <UNK> but for <UNK> <UNK> fans and i might add for self <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> individuals of all <UNK> this movie is a waste of time
<START> ladies and gentlemen please don't get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tag this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been <UNK> as one of the <UNK> horror films ever made horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should <UNK> their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film in shining there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive foolish attempt made to create chilling horror everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were <UNK> appears good too a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do there is not much to be said of a bald colored actor who for the most of times is busy <UNK> a kid actor no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy it cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes
<START> watching this i mainly noticed the ad <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and more it's one product placement after another it's quite obvious how this movie got its funding jessica <UNK> acting is laughable any dick shouldn't ever get work because he plays the same lame character the story is just a backdrop for this very long commercial i can't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release the longer you watch this movie the more you're embarrassed for everyone involved the only minor saving grace is larry miller and <UNK> lee cook who gets almost no screen time as <UNK> cousin i'm embarrassed i watched the whole thing i would recommend avoiding this one
<START> this adaptation positively <UNK> a classic which is beloved for its subtlety timothy dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of <UNK> character i get the feeling he never even read the book just <UNK> on set in his too tight <UNK> and was handed a character summary that read grumpy <UNK> murky past he plays rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top <UNK> who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously <UNK> into a <UNK> there is no chemistry the only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was <UNK> and also sympathy for charlotte <UNK> who is most definitely turning in her grave go and <UNK> the book rochester has a personality and by the way a passionate love scene does not mean you have to eat her face
<START> rob roy is and underrated epic of passion and action some mild spoilers within liam neeson gives a <UNK> performance as rob roy <UNK> one of the best in his career jessica lange is letter perfect as his wife mary they have the most passion and chemistry i've seen in a screen couple john hurt gives his best <UNK> aristocrat performance tim roth portrays one of the great screen villains his rape of mary is <UNK> and harrowing he really is a magnificent bastard in this movie the final duel between rob and cunningham is one of the best <UNK> ever well scripted <UNK> scored and michael <UNK> jones direction is flawless 10 out of 10
<START> in a <UNK> four prisoners <UNK> a cell <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife the drag <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> the retarded <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who ate his six months sister and the intellectual marcus <UNK> <UNK> who killed his wife one night <UNK> finds an ancient <UNK> hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell they realize that the book was written by <UNK> geoffrey carey in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic they decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison when they find the truth about <UNK> fate <UNK> is an original intriguing and claustrophobic french low budget horror movie the story is practically in the same location does not have any clichés and <UNK> the attention of the viewer until the last scene i am a great fan of french cinema usually romances dramas and police stories but i noted that recently i have seen some good french horror movies such as un <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and dead end my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> do <UNK> signs of the evil
<START> i chose to watch this film at <UNK> based on judd <UNK> and scott cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level the director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first time production br br one interesting aspect of this film is the love of <UNK> and new york city brooklyn in specific the movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both <UNK> and ordinary brooklyn life  again kudos to the director on this fine choice br br this is gem and i would whole <UNK> recommend it i'm sure it will make it to the screen
<START> this is a great movie for all ages its the story about three animals how have to find their way home there is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie you never know what is going to happen next this movie makes you cry and makes you laugh you just don't know what going to happen next the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful <UNK> scenes they producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too the animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors actress themselves everything about this movie is great 10 out of 10 the whole way rent or buy it today i can guarantee you will love it the whole family will
<START> this movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the <UNK> questions that have <UNK> up in recent <UNK> concerning the passion suffering and death of christ accounts in the new testament what motivated <UNK> if money was not the issue what could bring the <UNK> to meet on a high holy day why did <UNK> <UNK> it is a movie for the serious thinking christian fans of the passion of the christ will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization as for myself i find the portrait painted here of the <UNK> of ordinary people to so <UNK> sacrifice common decency when their own self interest is at stake far more realistic and deeply unsettling the <UNK> just doing my job look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in <UNK> <UNK> is as chilling as any moment in film the film makes no claim to authenticity but the settings and <UNK> <UNK> feel more right than many more highly acclaimed efforts it is a slow film but if you accept its self <UNK> limits it is after all the death not the life of christ ultimately a very rewarding one
<START> and it did it is through my experience that when a horror film reaches franchise status and subsequent titles are released thereafter they all in turn become stricken by one inevitable factor <UNK> omen iv the awakening makes no exception to this rule featuring another small child supposedly <UNK> their role as the anti christ <UNK> by a religious prophecy haven't we seen this before wasn't it enough that over the span of three films prior to this release we've experienced the rise and fall of <UNK> thorn if you're a horror <UNK> such as myself you'll realize that it's common for a horror movie that has many sequels and <UNK> to its credit to fade away into <UNK> children of the corn <UNK> phantasm the list goes on at this point in the game i'm sure you know what to expect when you're prepared to view the fourth title in a series regardless there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are omen iv the awakening is just that too a shameless money making exercise br br this film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the omen <UNK> as unique and genuine as omen iv tries to be compared to its siblings the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike elements like the guardian dog the involvement of a priest the <UNK> of the people involved the <UNK> death scene clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is <UNK> by the sheet of glass even right down to the father's involvement in politics and <UNK> within the community make it too predictable br br although it is common to star a b rated cast into a horror title this far into a series the acting is off the <UNK> chock full of <UNK> and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film the atmosphere has completely <UNK> in comparison to the first three titles in addition the epic score composed by <UNK> in the previous movies has been replaced by an <UNK> <UNK> an absolute joke and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a bank of stock audio which really says something because rarely do i comment on the lousy <UNK> of a musical score until now br br all in all i'd call omen iv the awakening a failure in the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them some manage to hit the mark and some don't if you're interested in creating another notch on your <UNK> horror belt such as i am for <UNK> purposes perhaps you could <UNK> this title into it as well if not for entertainment value then to appreciate when a film is executed properly or poorly
<START> well as <UNK> once said there really isn't any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that <UNK> to be objective on something that has had a great effect la <UNK> et la <UNK> has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what's been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film certainly should be <UNK> from watching it to express a purely <UNK> judgement however i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people don't watch it it's a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i don't mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their <UNK> praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless <UNK> of our emotional <UNK> and cruelty and so on and if it really managed to put across a universally or even <UNK> relevant message of this sort then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself however <UNK> his conclusions may be my <UNK> with the film is rather that i don't see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty <UNK> as being justified or <UNK> by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree of course because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom <UNK> up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree because we see the least of her <UNK> affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value of course but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre <UNK> is most likely not even acting and that with absurd remarks like un <UNK> beau <UNK> un film de nicholas ray he really was just <UNK> word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the <UNK> in which he along with the director <UNK> had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film i suppose if the tone of relentless <UNK> and <UNK> had been <UNK> throughout 100 of the film it might have worked as a long <UNK> comedy about a particularly shallow worthless and despicable post <UNK> <UNK> what made however this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his <UNK> of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and <UNK> in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us if a man can get away with living in the flat of and <UNK> to love one woman sleeping mostly in this very flat with another and running around paris <UNK> marriage to yet a third well i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog eat dog world he's chosen to create for himself what i can't however in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to <UNK> monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair the same goes double for the even more despicable <UNK> whom we are shown <UNK> drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the most savage and heartless cruelty as i say if la <UNK> et la <UNK> is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre <UNK> and marie three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home then i suppose there is a kind of <UNK> in <UNK> the director for being <UNK> though why one should even feel like <UNK> once one had <UNK> <UNK> to create such thoroughly <UNK> characters to <UNK> observe i can't imagine the problem however is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander <UNK> and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human <UNK> emotional <UNK> this latter idea however is <UNK> and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent <UNK> and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this <UNK> and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or <UNK> genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated miserable and alone or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la <UNK> et la <UNK> if you're historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which was probably unfortunately not <UNK> to just a few particularly anti social types like these but please don't make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean <UNK> or martin scorsese might be <UNK> to have
<START> richard attenborough who already given us <UNK> films as a chorus line and gandhi once more surprise us making a beautiful <UNK> to the nature indeed the vast and in that time <UNK> territory of canada helps to <UNK> the stunning beauty of the landscapes picked up by the motion picture camera if the movie is really based on a true story once more becomes <UNK> that men of vision are in truth men that lives beyond their time with a historical perspective that only the time will give them reason the cinematography is <UNK> such as the cast lead by pierce brosnan whose performance is due to <UNK> master hands a pleasing surprise is the appearance of annie <UNK> in the role of <UNK> beloved movie that must appears in a list of those who really loves the nature
<START> the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james <UNK> the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie <UNK> and everyone is perfectly cast james <UNK> has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to <UNK> up the action fall and then rise to a climax he does this with an element of humour plenty of twists thrills and blood this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure but what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action great
<START> sorry i don't have much time to write i am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years she said that scott wilson portrayed a <UNK> no conscience extraordinarily well i agree she also said that robert blake portrayed a person with anger and <UNK> control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly i agree what a chilling and tremendous film i have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100 my <UNK> friend deals with <UNK> such as these regularly my only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did
<START> i have to say from the beginning when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie with a lot of potential though the movie wasn't as <UNK> amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing even though i'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people i don't remember one line from either of those movies i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you ah getting slightly off the point here well my point is that the that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got <UNK> to its end in 2006 br br though i didn't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 and let me tell you the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn't for stargate and my dad who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6 and i'm glad he did other wise i wouldn't have seen the brilliant shows like <UNK> which now in my opinion sets the <UNK> for nearly all sci fi series and movies basically if a new sci fi series isn't better or as good as <UNK> its not worth watching basically this is the best sci fi show to date and if you don't watch this then you have no idea what you are missing
<START> it's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark film students should take this as a lesson and a warning would be graduate has an idea he wants total control so he writes directs produces his cinematic masterpiece all by himself usually his concept is far beyond his budget usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with usually he is more interested in the grand <UNK> of the story rather than on the <UNK> gritty of working with actors on individual scenes usually he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create <UNK> on a tiny budget usually he ends up with a series of encounters we cannot do justice by calling them scenes that feel like they were written by a 12 year old and usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer when you look at judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare
<START> if you are having a bad day or bad week if you are looking for a film that will make you laugh and forget about your troubles i don't think role models is that movie for you br br the film centers around danny paul rudd and <UNK> <UNK> william scott two juice <UNK> who go to schools promoting the product telling kids to stay off drugs and more juice but danny is having the worst week ever and crashes his company car with <UNK> in the seat next to him his soon to be ex girlfriend beth elizabeth banks who is a lawyer manages to avoid getting them jail time by doing hours of community service <UNK> at a big brother place called <UNK> wings led by <UNK> jane lynch <UNK> is assigned to <UNK> <UNK> j thompson who is 10 years old and has a foul mouth like he's chris rock danny is assigned to <UNK> <UNK> christopher <UNK> <UNK> who likes to dress like a knight and fight like he is in medieval times but will this be good for danny and <UNK> or will they be better off in jail br br okay i'm not gonna beat around the bush this movie was very unpleasant in many ways namely the <UNK> character hearing those bad words coming out of a kid that young was very shocking if he was a little bit older it would not have <UNK> as much i mean what where his parents thinking when they <UNK> him on to this elizabeth banks character is so unwatchable maybe i was supposed to feel bad for her character but i felt nothing because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female who would be played in these types of comedies and jane lynch who's the worst of the worst she delivers the most overacting performance ever playing a former drug addict who acts like she still is on drugs listening to her give all that annoying dialog made me want to throw my head up against the wall <UNK> william scott once again playing another <UNK> like character he should really try to separate himself and this film won't do it and the more scott tries to hard to be funny is what keeps him from being funny br br now paul rudd on the other hand i'm gonna separate from the others in the film cause he manages to deliver a solid performance although he does not get higher laughs but he is the most interesting character from the rest cause rudd does not <UNK> and does not try so hard the scenes with him and <UNK> <UNK> are watchable but the rest of the film is so stupid it picks up at times but it becomes so predictable and uninteresting it is a reminder that these types of comedies try nothing new there all the same they take no chances role models is an example of that
<START> this 1974 naschy outing is directed by leon <UNK> and a <UNK> glance at the publicity photos and <UNK> might lead you to believe that this medieval romp lies somewhere between <UNK> and <UNK> sadly not br br this is a strictly pg affair with tame torture sequences no nudity and little edge at all naschy of whom i am a fan <UNK> his stuff as <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de la <UNK> sadly he is more <UNK> villain than anything else one gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him and it done all before strictly therefore for naschy <UNK> only
<START> man i must say when i saw the trailer i was excited futuristic soldiers taking on bad ass vampires led by genre vet michael <UNK> in space i mean i wasn't expecting high art but it looked like a potential b movie classic this was no doubt a tv pilot <UNK> some time later into a feature film after it wasn't picked up alright i'll start with the films few good points the action was competent for a lower budgeted film and the cgi and locations used were passable now onto the bad first off michael <UNK> was <UNK> in this and his performance here well it was cheesy not in a good way but as i said he wasn't in it much anyways so i can't blame him one thing that was really stupid was the <UNK> type group for <UNK> no i'm not joking it's the dumbest most unbelievable thing i've seen in along time and it's taken seriously also this film commits one of the major b movie sins it <UNK> a lesbian scene and doesn't deliver most of all what sinks this film is nothing really happens since it was meant to be a pilot the script is almost nonexistent and it doesn't have a regular ending even the main villains only come in towards the end if ever a movie needed to up the sleaze and gore factor it's vampire wars in closing i will say the main crew on the spaceship were all very capable actors and could very well put this mess behind them and go on to bigger and better things they just had nothing to work with here
<START> surely one of the mysteries of the modern world this film is not considered to be within the top 100 films of all time br br if you watched this film and thought it was anything other than wonderful please let me know how al <UNK> performance is as good as it gets
<START> the plot is tight the acting is flawless the directing script scenery casting are all well done i watch this movie frequently though i don't know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me see it and drop me a line if you can figure out why i like it so much
<START> i watched this movie expecting what i got good sci fi cowboy stuff what really surprised me was that kurt russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role br br imagine trying to act under these two <UNK> you have hardly any dialogue and because you are playing a <UNK> military robot you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions <UNK> kinda like asking a <UNK> to perform a great <UNK> while <UNK> and <UNK> taped in spite of being <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> russell pulls off an incredible characterization his robot becomes human in spite of the constraints great job br br as usual jason <UNK> <UNK> that he will go down in history as a great <UNK> of the <UNK> villain the one you'd love to see drawn and <UNK> connie <UNK> was sweet soft <UNK> and gorgeous i'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty but it was hard to take one's eyes off her unfortunately gary <UNK> role was too small and limited br br much of the plot is quite standard with a fair amount of weaknesses but as it does have a sci fi comic book feeling i don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses by the end of the story the good guy wins and the <UNK> audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction yes br br the sort of <UNK> who thinks that russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of <UNK> who missed the whole point
<START> the mother tells of a recently widowed mid 60's mother of two adult children reid who on the heels of her husband's death finds herself awakening from a life of <UNK> as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover the film <UNK> on the quietly passive mom her <UNK> relationship with her grown son and daughter the silent needs she attempts to <UNK> in bed with her young lover and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a somewhat <UNK> drama with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the mother does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous <UNK> will play best with more mature audiences possibly women who may better empathize with the central character her needs and issues b
<START> hooper is not funny not <UNK> paced not romantic and non informative there is no real drama you would think that a movie about the world's greatest <UNK> would have some drama there was an attempt but it didn't seem real no character study no lessons learned it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun they were just trying to act like they were having fun there is no reason to watch unless you like to look at burt and want get an occasional glimpse of sally <UNK> the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do in fact <UNK> was the best actor in this movie <UNK> and the <UNK> was such a fun movie that i was ready to like hooper this movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time
<START> in modern day eastern europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career <UNK> and one taken reluctantly by <UNK> she <UNK> the <UNK> of an american seymour who becomes obsessed with her paying more and more money for time with her until he eventually wants to buy her outright she has two <UNK> with <UNK> emotional <UNK> to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of <UNK> with no feelings of her own however we are in modern art house cinema territory so conventions like narrative structure lighting the subject so it can be seen camera techniques that add to rather than distract from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned much of the time i had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did i care people began leaving the screening almost before the last <UNK> had arrived and i don't think i've ever seen so many people walk out br br images are important to the director characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in <UNK> red in fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary <UNK> positions between naked people in bed <UNK> and there were no drugs or related weirdness but perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional br br on the whole almost entirely without merit br br
<START> emma <UNK> gwyneth paltrow shakespeare in love <UNK> has nothing to do with herself but painting going with her friends on her <UNK> up and down saying hello to people in town and trying to match make everybody she knows i guess there were no movies no television in those days and the girls had nothing to do but <UNK> i wish she had read a little more i like gwyneth and think that she is a lovely young woman she is talented and in emma one has the <UNK> to hear gwyneth sing i am looking forward to seeing <UNK> where she is suppose to sing she is brave to speak british english with all those native <UNK> including emma <UNK> sister miss bates sophie thompson four <UNK> and a funeral dancing at <UNK> mrs <UNK> juliet stevenson truly <UNK> deeply was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991 gwyneth is part of the american movie <UNK> being none other than the daughter of director bruce paltrow st elsewhere and tony award winner <UNK> <UNK> the myth of <UNK> she will hopefully be around for a real long time lucky us i liked emma and also recommend it it is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days favorite scenes emma singing and playing the piano i specially like it when she sings a <UNK> favorite quotes mr knightley emma you didn't ask me to contribute a <UNK> emma your entire personality is a <UNK> mr knightley i thought you <UNK> miss bates it left us speechless quite speechless i tell you and we have not stopped talking of it since
<START> i had several problems with the movie br br 1 the screenplay specifically kim <UNK> voice over movies are not books they should show the action rather than have a voice over tell us what's happening occasionally i find a movie with a voice over that works but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script in fact it sounded to me as if she was practically reading <UNK> from the novel in her voice over br br 2 i felt no emotion in the relationship between jessie and brother thomas and also felt that alex <UNK> acting was pretty bad that's a significant failure for me in defining <UNK> and <UNK> characters with no connection between them it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sex <UNK> if it had been properly done the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story br br 3 with the book i understood <UNK> mid life crisis in the movie it seemed more like just plain boredom br br on the plus side i didn't think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the tv though that thought did occur to me
<START> whilst reading through the comments left for this show i couldn't help but notice that a large <UNK> of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will the thing about <UNK> is that it's a children's show for children so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy forced and probably stupid i even found one person saying the sets were stupid but i remember as an eight year old wondering why <UNK> had <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on his wall and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine they didn't yeah it can be annoying the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair but as a kids show i rate it 10 10 compared to the stuff they air in its place today well lets just say i wish it'd be re aired dvd release anyone
<START> this movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society therefore can thieves <UNK> and murderers the killer of this movie carl <UNK> james woods is all three and worse be held fully <UNK> for their deeds an interesting notion but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way and this is where killer a <UNK> of murder falls very short although the film tries to put <UNK> behaviour into perspective with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing the viewer never gets the idea that <UNK> is a victim rather than a <UNK> sure the system is corrupt with one mobster <UNK> the whole sick bay of <UNK> prison where most of the movie takes place most prison guards are sadistic bullies and the prison director something like a <UNK> <UNK> but why on earth does new prison guard henry lesser robert sean leonard take such pity on <UNK> even after having read his gruesome <UNK> the movie offers some explanation lesser witnesses <UNK> being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic and stereotypical guard and is impressed by <UNK> intelligence though it isn't clear why exactly lesser thinks this man is so smart surely this isn't enough to sympathize with a hostile man like <UNK> even though this movie tends to <UNK> his crimes and highlight his personality towards lesser <UNK> is quite loyal and the viewer is given the impression that for lesser this <UNK> all of the atrocities he has read about in <UNK> <UNK> does this man lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him perhaps it is lesser who is a product of modern society judging on appearance rather than substance br br i can advise monster starring <UNK> <UNK> and christina <UNK> as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope br br btw killer looks as though shot for tv not so good
<START> i really like this movie i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose that is one of my <UNK> for a great movie br br the story is very interesting it introduces us to 6 characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the <UNK> <UNK> his last student to attempt to make right the <UNK> that he suspects some of his students have committed br br how will the last <UNK> find the other <UNK> how will he know which of them is bad the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great br br we also get to see the <UNK> fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other br br if you want to see if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with it doesn't get any better than this
<START> why did i enjoy the show to the last episode because of the true talent melissa joan hart and her supporting cast had of <UNK> that <UNK> comedy light hearted humor and deep thought could actually <UNK> what i enjoyed most was the fact that i could come home from a hard day's work and bust a smile i was inspired and why it was an inspiration to watch as this magical person was so happy while helping others br br sabrina was a hero in my opinion even though she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from our own to very different she had powers at her <UNK> wishes and command that could be used for good or bad which may only exist in many of our <UNK> most everything we see have know about own or even desire can be used for good or bad and how we choose to define that <UNK> the person we are br br she traveled the globe and other <UNK> with these constant and <UNK> ideas in mind to learn to live to laugh and to love she was always learning how to improve her skills to the benefit of all around her she made mistakes as she was living life going through different <UNK> of growth as she her aunts and <UNK> the underrated yet <UNK> hero did well to demonstrate that even through mistakes you can still be noble gifted and wonderful br br she also demonstrated many <UNK> learning and loving acts as she went along her way if this isn't reason enough for 10 stars in this war torn world where people are so hostile toward each other not realizing how differences are the spice of life rather than a reason to kill then i don't know what is this show was most certainly a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift intended to bust a smile on our chops i've heard from a doctor before that everything that i've mentioned above leads to a healthy hart and isn't that what we all need
<START> don't know if this contains any spoilers or not but i don't want to risk being <UNK> until the year <UNK> br br i disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described guns <UNK> and steel as politically correct and neo <UNK> they cannot have watched the same series that i did br br the series i watched depicted the history of european <UNK> in the <UNK> and southern africa with no particular inaccuracies i saw nothing in the series that portrayed europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky though europeans often were lucky and there's nothing wrong with luck neither did i see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things if anything the <UNK> was rather arrogant as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with <UNK> if his country has not been <UNK> in living memory by any other world power br br i certainly saw nothing that could be <UNK> as <UNK> or neo <UNK> except by the most incredibly <UNK> of <UNK> br br otherwise many african peoples do have a built in <UNK> to <UNK> and other <UNK> <UNK> that europeans lack at the time they were at the height of their <UNK> the aztec <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were as advanced as any other in the world and as wealthy sometimes more so <UNK> american and <UNK> san <UNK> were <UNK> by <UNK> and other <UNK> introduced by europeans just as european <UNK> were <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> note the <UNK> san peoples are completely different from all other sub <UNK> african peoples br br so i don't see what some of the other <UNK> are complaining about the only thing i can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything i did not know by the time i finished seventh grade there's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film it does however present some nice <UNK> of events such as the conquest of the <UNK> the production values are very high and it fills in a few holes here and there that didn't get covered in mrs <UNK> sixth hour social studies class at <UNK> middle school br br if you rent or buy this assuming you had a decent primary and or secondary school education you won't learn anything new but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned or should have learned by the time you hit high school
<START> wow the <UNK> thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago i'll <UNK> by saying i'm not a fan of narrated episodes if the story actors etc are worth their salt they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out reminded me of <UNK> who can't think off the <UNK> but rely on <UNK> the <UNK> was tedious and boring but some enjoy that kind of thing it's just not my cup o tea they could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something <UNK> little things like <UNK> being at the house which has a <UNK> half circle <UNK> yet he seems to have <UNK> his car in the tree he was standing under because it's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property sloppy editing as she pulls into the <UNK> for what seems the <UNK> time exactly who are those 2 guys you see at <UNK> walking towards the car as she pulls into the <UNK> of the deserted house the <UNK> close ups were also overdone like some jr high drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time i could keep picking apart but that might get almost as boring as this episode was it kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of <UNK> driving the <UNK> <UNK> i fully expected to see the <UNK> <UNK> and a nice <UNK> play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player automatic top etc the only good thing i have to say about his one is that it just ends abruptly no loose ends tied up nothing explained or <UNK> not that many would notice i suspect most had already changed the channel or <UNK> off by the end
<START> i first saw this as a child living in east london the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street i remember having nightmares after seeing it the odd thing is it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction br br apart from a <UNK> destructive war the scale of the machines was badly awry more <UNK> technology now but overall an excellent and well crafted work it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then i would think that firing a <UNK> from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the <UNK> however much was right mans desire for war mans <UNK> to man the means of war as a <UNK> for development br br
<START> this was a pretty good film i'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment but i didn't want to take a chance anyway near the end of the film the <UNK> reads a <UNK> <UNK> and then quotes another from memory i can't remember the first passage he reads but the second one is <UNK> 9 6 he says it's <UNK> 9 12 but he actually quotes <UNK> 6 this is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment it's too bad that <UNK> dare not quote the bible today did anybody ever hear of john jay the first supreme court justice in the history of this country he said that the bible is the best of all books too bad we've lost that view in america
<START> i was at this film's premiere at the toronto film festival in 1997 after the screening when the writer director and some cast members offered to answer questions no one could even be bothered to ask any rarely has a film been so poorly directed why on earth were random frames <UNK> out of some scenes <UNK> acted david arquette to <UNK> dorothy parker does not run the emotional gamut from a to b he parks at a and brings a lunch and utterly pointless characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions at long last the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that's supposed to really make you think unfortunately what it makes you think is well there's 90 minutes of my life i'm never getting back
<START> just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion and justice to the movie br br first of all to get things straight this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie it doesn't aim to <UNK> the movie industry and garner critical <UNK> nor does it want to be regarded as one if you really want to enjoy this movie to the <UNK> i suggest you <UNK> your critical <UNK> and your longing for a good plot because you won't find any in here with that established let us further into the movie br br i had low expectations for this movie simply because it didn't have a strong plot yes <UNK> i underrated this movie as well but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much i even enjoyed this more than the stephen <UNK> flicks which i find kung fu <UNK> to be his best effort and would've rated it a 9 as well action is tight and epic while comedy <UNK> on to the right places br br spoilers alert i think the action might be unreal but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways there are a lot other sports movies drama that already did it well why create another spoilers end br br i'm not even sure why you're reading this go ahead and watch it just remember no thinking just watch enjoy smile laugh and br br every once in a while they the movie industry creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump i'm not saying kung fu <UNK> deserves the recognition that the previous examples have then again if we're talking about stephen <UNK> ish comedy this one's a top ten br br highly recommended if you love no <UNK> movies with really good action kung fu death <UNK> kung fu and comedy what the heck watch this you'll have a great time br br 9 10 for you the cast of kung fu <UNK>
<START> though i liked on the town better i really liked it i'm a new <UNK> when it comes to frank sinatra and gene kelly though i had heard of them i had never seen anything with them in it until recently the first one i saw was <UNK> in the rain that made me a fan of <UNK> i think that is better too but i thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's an awesome movie and i love it frank and gene make a good team i have yet to see them together in take me out to the <UNK> but i'm sticking to my guns <UNK> saying that i really enjoyed it and that i love it
<START> what a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject there is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight or gay man working in a gay sexual environment the dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic <UNK> they may not all be prostitutes for hire but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered from the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay <UNK> and then end up hiring the dancers for private sessions even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the dancers only playing to the women in the audience this just isn't the reality of these <UNK> it would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples so what do they really feel about their gay <UNK> and <UNK> we learn very little instead we get filler a gay <UNK> who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers a manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the <UNK> lives and attitudes br br the pictures of mexico city are generic the <UNK> montage showing <UNK> <UNK> is ridiculous br br this is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing the rest of the movie is an insult to gay men
<START> the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life actually it was only 35 minutes was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema all i have ever seen were few older movies of s ray br br <UNK> through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of 8 7 i <UNK> this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment oh my how wrong i was the only logical explanation for this rating of 8 7 is that most of <UNK> people who voted are indian and their only venture outside <UNK> production were adam sandler movies br br with this rating this movie would be <UNK> on <UNK> place on imdb list of 250 best movies above citizen <UNK> <UNK> of psycho i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience my only hope is that there is a lot of <UNK> who like me find this movie as is plain stupid with abundance of <UNK> and cheesy music
<START> one of the less widely <UNK> of recent asian period action affairs <UNK> is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering exciting layered and beautiful i'm sad to say i know virtually nothing of the <UNK> philosophy or japanese history and legend that <UNK> this film so its deeper meanings are lost on me but even without <UNK> knowledge this is still rich fare taking a traditional fantasy structure into a <UNK> higher plane the story is of <UNK> a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the demon of <UNK> bridge prince <UNK> himself a mortal <UNK> after his own higher plane but this time the power of demons thus the film becomes a matter of <UNK> and in <UNK> case <UNK> a conflict in which the real goal is self knowledge for <UNK> to come to terms with his true nature and for prince <UNK> to come face to face with the nature of what he seeks to become <UNK> is even more <UNK> here by the fact that his dark nature makes him <UNK> at odds with the world even when not in open conflict he is never at ease director <UNK> <UNK> handles this one as an epic with <UNK> pace camera work always stylish and often <UNK> without <UNK> the need for more <UNK> moments to let the location sink in there is also great use of lighting and fog to give an <UNK> atmosphere there is an air of fantasy to much of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty fantasy with more period fell than <UNK> of fancy the cinematography of <UNK> <UNK> is important here vivid and detailed a richly <UNK> affair <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and powerful with a mysterious <UNK> as <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> has a driven cold arrogance as prince <UNK> of the leads <UNK> <UNK> rounds things out as an ordinary man smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are the film all fits together well it is however a touch <UNK> at times it begins slowly some shots are a little drawn out and the epic fight scenes at times go on longer than strictly necessary as for the fighting it is filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves it has artistic impact but may disappoint regular action fans often <UNK> by objects flashing <UNK> and fast moving individuals <UNK> with deadly force through their <UNK> are the order of the day it is <UNK> to watch but in the end i could have done with a little more <UNK> there is some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting overall though i found this to be a pretty great film its not one for regular action fans or <UNK> <UNK> seeking another azumi rather a deeper and more mystical beast its ending in particular will not go down well with fans of the more generic wing of such fare but as for myself it really hit the spot and for those more <UNK> inclined it might do so too well recommended at any rate
<START> this is on my top list of all time favourite films it is a fantastic and insightful film it was historically interesting and great to watch i thought the acting from emily blunt was fantastic and rupert friend was a fantastic albert the best actor was chosen for albert the costumes were gorgeous and the settings and scenes such as the opera house were amazing and detailed i just loved it all of it i loved the childhood scenes were she's getting <UNK> by john <UNK> and where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult one again the writers have done it they produced this fantastic script br br it thoroughly deserves the awards they got oscar and <UNK> <UNK> sandy powell for costume design a <UNK> for best make up and hair an oscar in best achievement in art direction best achievement in costume design best achievement in makeup broadcast film critics association awards for best costume design also nominated for best actress emily blunt <UNK> for excellence in costume design for film period <UNK> international film awards for an audience award for best narrative film <UNK> for best costume design <UNK> <UNK> doesn't say what for <UNK> for best actress emily blunt overall 10 wins and 11 nominations that pretty good http www imdb com title <UNK> awards have a look yourself its really interesting personally rupert friend should have got an award
<START> i never really knew who robert <UNK> was before seeing this but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is this hbo special features him teaching american history to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal he <UNK> fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the u s but some other parts of the world this documentary comedy was a great satire that made me question if what i accept as the <UNK> true history is really true br br i enjoyed how mr <UNK> managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his her beliefs
<START> i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren whom i hadn't seen in any movies since rocky iv unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr lundgren who was okay ish <UNK> <UNK> was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make up br br the plot is not at all clever it's something that's been repeated a million times in different movies the crooks were utterly stereotypical and <UNK> character hadn't any depth in it i didn't really expect a movie masterpiece but unfortunately this is not even decent action every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over the top <UNK> and comic book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon br br i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic like action but only if nothing else is available br br 1 10 i guess the current average vote of 7 0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie
<START> wow pretty terrible stuff the richard burton elizabeth taylor <UNK> lands in <UNK> and <UNK> up with arty director joseph <UNK> for this remarkably ill conceived <UNK> williams fiasco taylor plays a rich dying widow holding <UNK> over her <UNK> on an island where she <UNK> very <UNK> her <UNK> to an incredibly patient secretary when <UNK> burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend taylor realizes her time is up <UNK> in the extreme it's difficult to determine if taylor and burton are acting badly or if it was <UNK> intention to make their characters so unappealing if that's the case then the acting is brilliant burton <UNK> his lines including the word boom several times while taylor <UNK> <UNK> she's really awful so is <UNK> coward as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the witch of <UNK> br br presumably boom is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along two standard williams themes but it's so <UNK> by <UNK> that had taylor and burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues any substance the film has would have been completely <UNK> br br boom does have stunning photography the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of <UNK> the supporting cast features joanna <UNK> the great <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> doctor and michael <UNK> as her nasty dwarf security guard both he and his dogs do a number on burton
<START> the movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and <UNK> of j aniston it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title but there's nothing successful in this movie br br polly is very well played by aniston no doubt this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly br br <UNK> stiller is the same <UNK> guy like in meet the parents but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above br br the script is very poor with nothing special at all with this two well <UNK> actors the things could get a lot better but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script br br 4 out of 10
<START> please avoid this movie at all costs this is without a doubt the worst movie i've ever seen most movies have at least one redeeming value this has none totally horrible
<START> i saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in canada still only in limited release it was worth the wait and then some i am a very avid reader of margaret laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film i actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel i liked that the character of <UNK> <UNK> was a bit less harsh and that there seemed to be more of a love story between <UNK> and <UNK> which made the scenes at the end of <UNK> life that much more moving the loss seemed stronger <UNK> was not any more likable on film than in the book but ellen <UNK> was a genius in this role she was <UNK> through and through christine <UNK> was brilliant and has many more great things ahead i am sure her scenes with cole <UNK> were <UNK> i could go on and on overall a 9 out of 10 fantastic and can't wait for it to come out on dvd a must own for my collection
<START> tarzan the ape man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time and like that earlier film it has little resemblance to <UNK> literary character but while the 1932 tarzan was reduced to tarzan jane speech this tarzan played by miles <UNK> doesn't speak or even <UNK> he does do the the tarzan yell a couple of times which sounds like it was <UNK> from the earlier film br br no tarzan plays second banana to bo derek as jane or rather as third banana to bo <UNK> left breast and her right breast this movie has no point but to show derek naked br br the two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad more evidence that no one cared br br <UNK> enough tarzan has an <UNK> side kick in this film maybe he car <UNK> in from <UNK> with the indian elephants that are also on display
<START> i don't quite know how to explain <UNK> room because to <UNK> it wouldn't really do it justice it's a <UNK> <UNK> short film with two beautiful girls in a strange mysterious situation i would say this short is definitely more on the <UNK> drive end of the <UNK> spectrum as opposed to the elephant man or the straight story it's hidden on lynch's website and well worth the search
<START> from a modern sensibility it's sometimes hard to watch older films it's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical <UNK> <UNK> have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man especially such a shallow and <UNK> man he's obviously a player i wouldn't trust him to stay true to her who doesn't want to settle down who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them baby <UNK> even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him he only goes to her after he's supposedly rejected by another woman and learns that connie spent all her money <UNK> a boat for him i wanted her to stand up to him not <UNK> chase after him his sudden <UNK> within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me br br apart from that subplot i did like the movie how can you not like sailors dancing with each other you can tell they were from san francisco d the rehearsal dance was great watching ginger rogers <UNK> fall in and out of the correct steps was great the last dance scene face the music with the beautiful costumes and the art <UNK> set was beautiful and i really enjoyed we saw the sea though they did use it a few too many times as if they realized it was their best song br br anyway the plot was a bit weak like most musicals imo and the songs were ok but the dancing was worth watching the film for i wish they could have showed some shots of san francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set br br it's also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what hitler was already doing at that time i have to try to suspend all knowledge to <UNK> myself into a made up fantasy land
<START> directed by <UNK> <UNK> this is definite cop film of indian cinema may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force politics with no holds <UNK> how it effects on a young cop a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop bad cop hindi films but this is different today's generation which grown up watching dark realistic films like <UNK> <UNK> may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn't pay much attention to such kind of cinema yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class mass audience when it released for <UNK> <UNK> its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema he delivered a class performance as inspector <UNK> its more than cop character he <UNK> a lot which is something original in acting watch his scenes with his father whom he hates <UNK> whom he loves <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the dignity of her character to the expected level my god what a natural expressions she carried <UNK> <UNK> was truly a discovery for me he's a brilliant character actor if given a chance here in some of the scenes he <UNK> even <UNK> the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> it's another story that he didn't get such a <UNK> role almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of <UNK> b grade action films watch the scene where <UNK> 1st time becomes a rebel for his father played by <UNK> <UNK> next both are sharing wine together how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love hate for each other two faces of indian police force <UNK> <UNK> and in between lies half truth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> touch the film won 2 national awards as best hindi feature film best actor <UNK> <UNK> 3 <UNK> awards in best film best director best supporting actor categories br br recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi films br br ratings 8 10
<START> cult of the <UNK> is now available on dvd in a <UNK> print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie unfortunately that is not saying much br br it has a competent cast of second <UNK> that <UNK> themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances it is <UNK> directed entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio <UNK> it looks ok but is <UNK> over plotted and at a <UNK> 80 minutes it is still heavily padded br br for example the double <UNK> attack on the first of the <UNK> was surely one attack too many br br the business about julia choosing to marry pete rather than tom never amounts to anything tom immediately falls in love with lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of julia nor is she br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development but it doesn't similarly <UNK> investigation into <UNK> <UNK> and the suspicion that briefly falls on tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time br br these are just <UNK> of the underlying problem the movie is structured like a mystery but it isn't as soon as the curse is <UNK> we know exactly where the story is heading so the characters are left <UNK> <UNK> what we already know br br the ending is particularly lame julia is <UNK> purely by accident lisa has no reason to want to kill her she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when tom turns up in the nick of time to save her it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all he then simply <UNK> of the <UNK> in the way any of the previous victims might have done br br it is such an <UNK> little <UNK> of a story that i found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads then it occurred to me someone said those val <UNK> movies were very successful over at rko so why don't we make one like that br br cult of the <UNK> is clearly <UNK> on cat people mysterious troubled shape shifting woman falls in love with the hero is apparently <UNK> kills people <UNK> the <UNK> of the hero's woman friend and dies at the end but <UNK> <UNK> doesn't mean <UNK> good <UNK> by a wide <UNK> it copies but doesn't understand what it is <UNK> br br it is obviously trying for the low key suggestive <UNK> style but this approach doesn't follow through into the story lisa is no irene she is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her we get a glimpse of her after the first attack in asia so immediately <UNK> her when she turns up in new york there is never any doubt about her purpose neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake br br then again during her <UNK> <UNK> we get not one but two attempts at <UNK> neither come off because the director doesn't understand what makes a <UNK> work and in any case they happen to the stalker not the person being stalked br br these faint echoes of cat people give cult of the <UNK> whatever small distinction it might have but they only draw attention to the <UNK> <UNK> between the original and the imitation br br <UNK> may be the <UNK> form of <UNK> but i doubt if <UNK> or <UNK> were particularly <UNK> when this tepid little time <UNK> came out
<START> there's a group of fox tv executives sitting around a <UNK> table wondering what new show to <UNK> br br <UNK> about aiming for something like 24 or the west wing ' says one of them but they all agree it would be too expensive and cheap tv is less likely to harm the station if it <UNK> br br <UNK> how about getting together some great comedy writers and doing a quality sitcom ' offers another and is fired on the spot <UNK> you know good writers cost lots of money ' the big chief <UNK> <UNK> why we invented reality tv ' br br <UNK> could do yet another crime drama ' suggests a man in a bland suit <UNK> listening ' the boss replies suddenly interested <UNK> like <UNK> so let's do another copy of that ' <UNK> adds br br <UNK> there are already far too many <UNK> <UNK> out there what can we do to make <UNK> stand out ' a naive junior <UNK> and is <UNK> instantly <UNK> out if we do that people may be confused let's give them more of what they already like ' the big chief screams br br <UNK> just add more violence and make it really grisly we are fox after all ' another suit suggests to a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> you're getting <UNK> from the big chief <UNK> could make them the <UNK> crimes unit ' he goes on to add clearly on a roll br br <UNK> <UNK> he's got it ' the big chief laughs <UNK> the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on screen ' <UNK> that would certainly distract people from the average acting and poor scripts ' <UNK> points out br br <UNK> it's settled we just need a name ' the big chief <UNK> <UNK> could call it sex cops violence ' br br <UNK> literal how about killer <UNK> conveys violence but sounds a bit like basic instinct which had lots of sex ' br br <UNK> the big chief replies and then they all slap each other on the back and go and <UNK> arrested development
<START> well the main reason i tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by <UNK> parker and matt stone of south park fame however as soon as the film started the laughs started <UNK> from my belly from the subtle gestures towards a joke to the blatant toilet humour throughout along with a constant <UNK> on some very witty innuendo this film could ruin event he <UNK> mans poker face let alone his poker underwear some of the funniest blink and you'll miss it jokes ever portrayed in hollywood along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain br br i just goes to show that not only is <UNK> parker <UNK> at writing he's not too <UNK> at the old acting game either i was surprised with the amount that i was absorbed in this film however i'm quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet here in the uk sort it out boys br br i am and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits and occasionally <UNK> into my <UNK> all in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy however if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear however i'm sure the inclusion of jenny mccarthy and <UNK> <UNK> could have you <UNK> past those prejudices
<START> turn your backs away or you're gonna get in big trouble out of my <UNK> back only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of <UNK> and doom at the very moment you're watching this it's safe to say that the entire movie falls apart with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max we get a name like johnny every so often and this johnny has nowhere to go there isn't a specific reason to why our dead corpse <UNK> out of his grave just to survive until prom night so that <UNK> the movie totally useless without a feeling of sorrow his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he's dead johnny takes a bite out of <UNK> arm afterwards the viewer is asked a tough question why does the movie have to be this <UNK> there is an answer any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely <UNK> living is a coincidence dead has nothing in common with the movie show this one to your girlfriend and she'll skip the senior prom turning your life into a deserted ruin blah
<START> do we really need any more <UNK> garbage on the baby <UNK> generation technically i am a <UNK> though at the time when all the idealistic <UNK> of the '60s were reading marx burning their draft cards and generally <UNK> a war which destroyed <UNK> of thousands of lives i was still in grade school but i remember them well and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools who would believe anything as long as it was destructive br br this is just another <UNK> in self importance from the kids who never really grew up
<START> above average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time a <UNK> of <UNK> camp hangs around this flick as a period piece it's more accurate than not its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> but moving chris cooper turns in a first class performance as <UNK> coal <UNK> daddy
<START> painful painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting shakespearean play i gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldn't bare to even finish viewing it to the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of much <UNK> was i pity you and your bored brain may your <UNK> about young viewers be lifted without <UNK> please do not even bother with this gut wrenching disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed shakespeare drama you will be forced to <UNK> <UNK> and will require a <UNK> close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because <UNK> <UNK> will take place
<START> four best friends young male <UNK> pigs with the emphasis on pigs meet weekly at a nyc diner to <UNK> their dating <UNK> in this <UNK> and visceral comedy <UNK> is the common <UNK> who dates the three <UNK> in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable <UNK> although the film's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had overall the flick doesn't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the <UNK> of the story one of those one man band <UNK> with a dozen producers whipped is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think the man show is emmy material
<START> <UNK> are too polite to boo but the audience at the toronto film festival left the theater <UNK> that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets the premise is that a modern filmmaker is <UNK> a <UNK> century fable about the loves of <UNK> and <UNK> set in the distant past when <UNK> were the spiritual leaders working in three <UNK> presents many opportunities to introduce <UNK> including silly and <UNK> clothing and peculiar spiritual <UNK> that involve really bad poetry lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid <UNK> to idiotic <UNK> of conduct from which cross dressing and <UNK> <UNK> situations <UNK> the film could have been hilarious as a monty python piece which it too closely resembles but <UNK> effort falls very flat the audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise <UNK> the slow pace the ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful this is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time
<START> left behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars the acting is weak and uninspiring the story even weaker the audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking the production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action the effects are wholly unoriginal and flat the lighting and overall continuity are <UNK> awful even compared to movies with a <UNK> of the budget however none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it's <UNK> and it's religious <UNK> and who can blame them however it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate <UNK> filmmaking
<START> oh it's so cool to watch a silent classic once in while director <UNK> is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy at least for <UNK> cameo as himself the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really <UNK> from the real world for a moment she even <UNK> her poor past the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character marion davies sees marion davies in the studios and concludes she doesn't seem that special it's got to be one of the first movie in the movies here and for real freaks it's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then a must see if you ask me
<START> this is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re <UNK> it doesn't work at all firstly the <UNK> is all wrong it's very slow moving at first and then <UNK> and <UNK> moves to an end but there is also and that may have to do with the cuts an uneasy moving between genres it starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then <UNK> into a farce rather than satire the ending may be funny but it's also so blunt that i almost felt it insulted my intelligence what little there is so the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all you can also see that in the very <UNK> character development you almost get the impression connery plays three roles rather than one
<START> i really liked this movie i have seen several gene kelly flicks and this is one of his best i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris sometimes it seems the story gets lost in gene kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers but not in this movie it is definitely worth renting
<START> hugh ed harris is a <UNK> bachelor senator determined to run for president one day however he happens upon an old high school <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> diane keaton is an accomplished and award winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit hugh is smitten he convinces <UNK> to become his fiancé but will <UNK> have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics where things are not always what they seem to be and will she be able to <UNK> the <UNK> of a harsh media <UNK> this is mostly a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection hugh and <UNK> are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view however although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality it doesn't completely succeed <UNK> the production values are high and the script is very <UNK> written with these <UNK> and the handsome <UNK> of keaton and harris those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment
<START> <UNK> was a wonderful tv western series focusing on a band of trail <UNK> lead by the trail boss <UNK> favor most episodes especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of favor and his men guest stars came and went but unlike <UNK> train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in <UNK> was a true gritty western and <UNK> favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten thanks to eric <UNK> performance the show became a massive hit of course he was <UNK> supported by a wonderful cast of good actors clint eastwood <UNK> <UNK> paul <UNK> steve raines james <UNK> rocky <UNK> robert <UNK> all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history <UNK> captured the <UNK> of that time of the west that no other series has for me as yet anyhow managed to do so later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines for me some of the time this didn't work the cattle drive and the <UNK> provided the best stories however there were still some classic stories and <UNK> remained top <UNK> affair the black and white photography added to a bleak realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture <UNK> indians <UNK> beautiful <UNK> in distress serial killers they all showed up to give our heroes problems the end came for the series quietly when the final season was <UNK> less than half way through the reason eric <UNK> had <UNK> and <UNK> was now a head without a body the gritty realism was gone <UNK> favor <UNK> respect and <UNK> authority he was never <UNK> and this made him all the more interesting we shall not see his like again watch an episode whenever you can they seldom disappoint
<START> haven't seen any of the japanese grudge films but i really enjoy this one i rarely get scared when watching films i can jump if the effect and sound is startling enough but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me but i did get scared from grudge maybe because i didn't expect anything at all when i watched it i didn't expect getting scared i didn't know anything about it either that was probably a good thing br br this is a film that you apparently either love or hate most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudge films but even though i haven't seen them i believe it isn't right to compare any film actually this film stands on it its own br br the story is weak most people say i don't agree the story is <UNK> and done so on purpose the story telling techniques used the broken time frame for instance is perfectly done the director knows exactly what he's doing and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted it br br i gave this film 8 of 10 it is a film you will enjoy watching or hate it's as simple as that
<START> broad enough for you wait till you see this heavy handed br br adaption of a little <UNK> one act what is shocking and wild in br br college rarely holds up over time and this is proof to take on the br br catholic church with <UNK> humor just isn't shocking or br br interesting or funny it's kind of boring the performers are all br br game giving all they've got but it's basically a play that doesn't br br open up to film well not a lot of fun
<START> hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film the plot of the film involving two <UNK> fighting over a girl is straight forward drama without much to recommend it hitchcock's talent though is found in his stunning use of images nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer he <UNK> it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement <UNK> has shown us all we need to know the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point of view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women the object of the <UNK> desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old <UNK> who help to destroy happy relationships all in all the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual <UNK>
<START> why do movie makers always go against the author's work i mean yes things have to be <UNK> for the sake of viewer interest but look at anne of green <UNK> they did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful i can't believe that they chose to combine three novels together for anne of <UNK> into such a dreadful mess look at all they missed out on by doing that paul irving little elizabeth the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> college years for <UNK> sake wouldn't it have been delightful to meet <UNK> and all the rest of the <UNK> gang kevin sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time instead of <UNK> them all together and combining characters and events the way he did this movie was good if you leave the novels out of it but l m <UNK> beautiful work is something that should not be denied this movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he <UNK> anne of green <UNK> to life

<START> this film's basic premise is a political cartoon i suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a feel good film on gender <UNK> indeed a recent <UNK> stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do what <UNK> no one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately <UNK> moore <UNK> up for seal hell week in the early 27 week bud s program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a seal is simply not going to make it so there is approximately an 80 <UNK> rate in what is arguably the <UNK> military training program those are the ones who <UNK> drop out can't compete on a physical level suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can't handle the psychological <UNK> i never got beyond the <UNK> of the contrived <UNK> message of this film in the real world <UNK> wouldn't last the first 24 hours in this harsh and <UNK> physical training wishing alone won't do it skip this film as <UNK> thinking and better spend your time reading the warrior elite by dick couch crown new york 2001 for the best description as to what really goes on in this training ring the bell <UNK> br br
<START> a favourite of mine this movie tells of two <UNK> new york characters steve <UNK> raft and chuck <UNK> <UNK> who both <UNK> to be the main guy in the <UNK> in the late <UNK> century br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were real people though this is a heavily <UNK> account of their antics based on a play <UNK> legendary did he do it it's still a cause of argument jump from the brooklyn bridge <UNK> for which he became famous is shown here as happening around the same time as the spanish american war <UNK> director walsh clearly had a great affection for the period so beautifully <UNK> here and it includes a wild <UNK> <UNK> number from saloon singer <UNK> <UNK> a young <UNK> <UNK> raft is at his <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> shows again what a clever actor he was as tough big hearted and at times quite touching <UNK> pretty fay <UNK> is the love interest both the boys are pursuing br br full of life and energy the <UNK> moves at a fast pace unlike many early <UNK> it is not an easy movie to find but is well worth looking out for
<START> i quote <UNK> rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even made br br this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i am in no way an uwe boll <UNK> like most of the <UNK> people on imdb br br uwe boll movies like <UNK> and tunnel rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining but honestly this movie was just horrible i hated it so much that i'd give it a zero star rating if i could the story is just crap it spends four <UNK> of the film building the plot and then they have the middle which is just scenes of <UNK> horrible <UNK> done murder the finally end it with a <UNK> wins ending which is totally acceptable but surely it could have been more <UNK> than this br br i am not against uwe boll like i said earlier nor am i against violent movies i f king love violent movies i loved the saw movies the hostel movies tokyo gore police the new york <UNK> the 28 movies dog soldiers my bloody valentine last house on the left <UNK> wolf creek every tarantino movie every sam <UNK> even cannibal f king holocaust but this <UNK> br br this was just cruel sadistic and perverted and look at the movies i just listed if i liked cannibal holocaust and not this then it must be bad uwe don't go all dark again you're funny when you are light hearted just like ed wood this was just an awful experience i felt horrible all over after seeing this br br do not watch avoid at all cost
<START> david beckham is a british soccer star and the husband of victoria beckham posh spice of the spice girls his trademark is a goal shot that <UNK> across the pitch and into the net the soccer equivalent of an <UNK> <UNK> ball in baseball bend it like beckham means making that type of spectacular shot apart from that and a little <UNK> to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux cameo at the very end the movie has nothing to do with him br br the movie is full of little soccer in jokes such as the present that one of the characters' parents give her of a jersey with the number 9 on it property of the great <UNK> <UNK> to those in the know references to posh <UNK> <UNK> the video homage to the <UNK> one of the characters plays for a <UNK> friend they have that lesbian gags sports <UNK> gags and so on br br the story is about a teenage girl in england who <UNK> beckham and wants to be a soccer star she has a real gift but the two seemingly <UNK> obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the uk hence their fascination with our <UNK> and her parents who are indian immigrants set in very old fashioned ways that do not allow daughters among other things to engage in contact sports the girl's family are portrayed as figures of ironic fun but with great affection think my big fat greek wedding the girl loves and respects them enough to go through sitcom hell to <UNK> her growing soccer stardom from them
<START> the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house good effects work and sound work a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house there are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past i found interesting there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts <UNK> themselves in sheets <UNK> and the house itself jerry <UNK> score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you what i wish could've happened is for something a little more intense jan de <UNK> had a pg 13 rating to <UNK> with and i think that he held back a little too much <UNK> scared me silly when i saw it many years ago and it still holds up the haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror the ending was for me a little <UNK> overall i enjoyed it the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump i just wish it scared me more
<START> from the director of movies <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> me <UNK> comes another movie in the noir style john <UNK> created a <UNK> for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery <UNK> in the early 90s though i did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction but nowadays mr <UNK> has <UNK> to directing television shows its a shame since the man had talent br br spoilers this is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter cage that comes in to the town of <UNK> for a job however he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit man from texas by bar owner j t walsh he is given the task to kill his wife boyle but cage decides to split after taking the <UNK> <UNK> without doing it on the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road who he then takes back to the local hospital at that point cage <UNK> meets walsh again who also appears to be the local sheriff after that cage escapes from his <UNK> but meets in to the real hit man that happens to be dennis hopper br br john <UNK> has co written and directed this movie therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen the direction is of good standard however while watching the movie i got a made for tv movie feeling there were too many close up frames however this does not <UNK> the movie from being an enjoyable experience the movie had good pace and the structure was perfect <UNK> written the script with good duration of <UNK> br br cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained his facial expressions were on the mark lara flynn boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale her <UNK> was far out and can make any guy go on his knees hopper played his part well but i feel he was miscast for this role he did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit man the role was not written keeping his personality in mind br br while viewing one will get <UNK> <UNK> of previous movies like 'the hot <UNK> and 'a perfect <UNK> due to the fact that some sub plots are similar overall if you are a fan of noir movies then this one is for you worth <UNK> 7 10
<START> this film has the <UNK> of a really good story the work of the men and women of the coast guard especially in the north pacific is the stuff of heroes and legends this film <UNK> up a good story with three endings none satisfying a couple of <UNK> and pointless bar fights and two alleged romantic relationships that have as much spark as dead <UNK> the rescue scenes are great even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal but the <UNK> is lame and disappointing <UNK> is good especially his hand acting watch for it <UNK> <UNK> is flat but not terrible the main female characters are one dimensional the best female is one of the coast guard sailors in the rescue center and she's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film it could have been an excellent film and <UNK> needs one
<START> the film of artemisia may be considered <UNK> or as true artistic license br br which might one <UNK> br br in documented history artemisia <UNK> was subjected to the <UNK> and still <UNK> that she was r ed as mary <UNK> and gloria <UNK> have <UNK> <UNK> br br in the movie under a different torture she refused to <UNK> her lover <UNK> br br how may a movie <UNK> so much from received history yet still inform the human heart br br the answer is not so hard to find in the movie the director and cast had filled a <UNK> hole in the historical record with the power of imagination br br that led to a conclusion that <UNK> from the record br br so be it i find both the record and the movie to be compelling br br in both the movie and it seems in history artemisia was a painter before all else br br for that vision framed in ravishing <UNK> film composition i am truly grateful br br seldom have i seen a movie that so compelled my eyes br br david <UNK>
<START> romantic comedies can really go either way you know you'll see one that's really sappy and you'll think you want something more realistic then you'll see one that's realistic but it might be too dull to keep you interested or maybe you'll see one that does everything right but just fails to make you smile romantic comedies are tough movies you go into them with a lot of expectations and usually whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the <UNK> was <UNK> your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you br br of course if you've got a girl next to you and you're a guy like me it probably doesn't matter all that much whether the movie's any good you've got other things on your mind for you i say go get her tiger for the rest of us i say see a guy thing it's a lot of fun br br because a guy thing knows you're going in to this movie with expectations so it doesn't pretend that its guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams and it's not his wife plot is going to make everyone happy sure maybe you like it but maybe it doesn't ring true or you think it's cruel a guy thing covers that what a guy thing does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i've seen in a long time so if you don't the main <UNK> you've still got something to make you smile br br whether we're talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen like larry miller pretty woman best in show james <UNK> traffic julie <UNK> airplane david <UNK> saturday night live and conan o'brien regular dirty work austin powers ii or thomas lennon the state and <UNK> variety or new faces like shawn <UNK> the <UNK> or colin <UNK> saving silverman we're talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterisation steal the show time after time and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days br br and that's not to detract from the actual romantic <UNK> and the stars that carry it along because it's very sweet and terribly well done jason lee <UNK> chasing amy dogma etc is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control and <UNK> blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring <UNK> and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is br br a lot of the success of the movie though falls on julia stiles the right girl in the right place at the wrong time and she wears it well not since gosh i don't know when have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy of course it's all in the closeups the voice and the subtle smiles but it's magical and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place br br but julie <UNK> slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead on in their classic simplicity this is a movie that paints a broken world of <UNK> stock types makes them fall over each other to make you laugh and then comes through with a great deal of heart br br a guy thing is a movie you've definitely seen before and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it we haven't really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare the relative success of this one or that one is entirely <UNK> upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a <UNK> edge often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play br br for the record it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional <UNK> notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy so even the <UNK> out there might get a kick out of it br br and guys i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee's friends in this movie i'm not going to spoil it for you but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the <UNK> and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest <UNK> in cinema i suggest you just say it's a guy thing and leave it at that
<START> <UNK> depicts the <UNK> of a woman in pre and during wwii raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for thought crime this movie was directed by <UNK> <UNK> and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful although the historical correctness of some scenes most notably the beach scene is a suspect br br the acting in this movie is absolutely incredible i am <UNK> at how they managed to gather this all star cast for a 2008 film <UNK> <UNK> possibly the most <UNK> still active actress in japan will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film <UNK> <UNK> in a supporting role was really nice as well it was <UNK> <UNK> though who delivered the most impressive performance perfectly portraying the <UNK> of his character and the difficult situation he was in br br films with pre war setting is not my thing but thanks to wonderful directing and acting i was totally absorbed by the story also it wasn't a far left nonsense like <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> and <UNK> the controversial and sensitive issue of government <UNK> and <UNK> that occurred in that period in japan excellent film highly recommended for all viewers
<START> i can't believe that those <UNK> this movie <UNK> aren't thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film that's also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when you've got a <UNK> ear to work with you can't make a <UNK> purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in dorothy s fans should stick to <UNK> peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter <UNK> amazingly awful book killing of the <UNK>

<START> i'm sorry but this is such a bad movie it's hilarious football <UNK> arguing in a travel <UNK> suits shades alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this it is as far from the truth as you can get br br the casting was atrocious gary <UNK> as a football <UNK> he doesn't look scary act scary or even come across as someone who would like football and as for yeti what the hell suits shades and sitting in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> each other with its about time you got your <UNK> on please br br and the <UNK> gang <UNK> the <UNK> underwear br br i don't see how anyone can even take this film seriously br br 4 10 its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties <UNK> i have ever seen
<START> good films cannot solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top surprised to see it has won two awards extremely overrated i first saw that kind of films from china visually stunning but also with really something captivating to say well more than 10 years ago and i'm sure there are still more coming up this is not one of them i'm afraid
<START> this is one of the worst movies ever made trite predictable flat br br the only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes <UNK> <UNK> i imagine they would use films like this in <UNK> or some other hidden cia <UNK> prison to torture suspects br br often bad movies have some redeeming features this has nothing if i was in it or worked on it i would change my name truly a turd hard to write more than this but i feel the world's film <UNK> needed a <UNK> up on this on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can't stand br br you could send it to politicians you dislike in laws ex wives teachers you hated former employees dick <UNK> w and a host of others
<START> i've been intrigued by this film for a while in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb a 9 0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film how had i not heard of this film before this website well you can't always trust the ratings this is actually a very good film <UNK> quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication excellent acting by the principals especially william haines as brown and good location work at <UNK> with some fine action footage in the climactic <UNK> <UNK> football game but the story must have seemed a <UNK> <UNK> even in <UNK> obnoxious self centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place becoming in the process a caring self <UNK> friend i doubt people in <UNK> found much that was really exciting in the last few <UNK> the predictability factor is high still it starts out very well and is certainly deserving of being remembered if not praised to the heavens maybe the previous <UNK> voters are mostly <UNK> men br br edit now <UNK> voters and the score has actually <UNK> to 9 2 seriously folks there is <UNK> <UNK> going on here i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than metropolis or the general
<START> still a sucker for <UNK> <UNK> sense i liked this movie though the unfinished ending was a let down as usual <UNK> develops a <UNK> sense of humour and kathy <UNK> fights are extremely impressive beautifully photographed this has the feel it was done for the big screen
<START> i really wanted to like this western being a fan of the genre and a fan of buffalo bill wild bill <UNK> and <UNK> jane all of whom are in this story add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor and it sounded great br br the trouble was it wasn't i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this being bored to death jean <UNK> character was somewhat annoying and james <UNK> just did not look like nor act like buffalo bill cooper wasn't at his best either sounding too wooden this was several years before he hit his prime as an actor br br in a nutshell his western shot <UNK> head up the pass and watch another <UNK> because most of 'em were far better than this one
<START> this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget dialog is <UNK> stupid chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the on screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film's last five minutes a briefly <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> early in that scene is certain to <UNK> and <UNK> crap on the film's chief villain no prop is here without a purpose the whole film is <UNK> reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of <UNK> <UNK> studio when he'd give a first time director a few bucks and a camera but without the discipline corman would <UNK>
<START> i'll admit that i don't expect much from a roger corman film generally i expect a lot of walking and bad scripts yet in this case i am pleasantly surprised br br the <UNK> is a story of a woman played by the <UNK> beverly garland who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered ms garland is a pretty good shot herself killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral her first task is to shut down the local bar that is <UNK> the town <UNK> the <UNK> owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the hoped for <UNK> however ms garland is a thorn in her plans and the bar <UNK> hires a man to kill ms garland br br because of ms <UNK> plays her role honestly and realistically there is absolutely no temptation to go to suzanne <UNK> she's the sheriff jokes with the exception of a couple of faux <UNK> the apartment door that opens out from the inside <UNK> tracks and the two <UNK> waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare however corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes much like he does walking in other films br br <UNK> says the <UNK> is a horse opera worth your time
<START> in the very first episode of friends which aired 22 <UNK> 1994 the one where monica gets a roommate there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is if you ever need holding does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song it is seems as if it is a great song i would love to get a copy of it thanks for the assistance i am looking for the album cd it is on so i can purchase it br br i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again it just seemed to be believable thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years
<START> i was very surprised with this film i was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his marie the little girl he was separated from the humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do actually i was expecting paulie wants a cracker jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room <UNK> so if you wish to see a good animal that talks film check this one out much better than dr <UNK> in my opinion paulie also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well
<START> much like orson welles thirty years earlier mike sarne was given the biggest train set in the world to play with but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe despite post modern interpretations <UNK> somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist <UNK> the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today how anyone given the resources at mr <UNK> <UNK> could have screwed up so <UNK> remains a closely <UNK> secret only michael <UNK> ever came close with the political and artistic <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> gate both films appeared to be ego <UNK> for their respective directors but at least mr <UNK> had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> whereas mr sarne had only the rather <UNK> joanna in his locker furthermore <UNK> gate could <UNK> some memorable and well handled set pieces where <UNK> myra <UNK> s <UNK> was bare simply put it is <UNK> the worst example of biting the hand that <UNK> in the history of hollywood
<START> fair drama love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love the acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography screenplay directing and editing the story script is only average at best this film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the <UNK> is on a more <UNK> and <UNK> level it would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding <UNK>
<START> as soon as i knew <UNK> <UNK> being in this flick i said i have to watch this movie she's the <UNK> main character domino a bounty hunter her job as the no action scenes would teach us reflects her rebel violent attitude to life i have to admit that it's the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands so this <UNK> me a bit anyway for all the john <UNK> fans there are <UNK> falling down explosions <UNK> as if it would rain and a lovely <UNK> that shoots with two machine guns one per hand the cast is absolutely brilliant going beyond <UNK> which in this movie is a real <UNK> pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see mickey rourke is back with his usual slap throwing face and his potent body christopher walken makes his job pretty well as a reality show producer br br let's go to the <UNK> this movie has a <UNK> shape the talk show scene is <UNK> real anyone that watched that load of you know what can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations as well as the producer when <UNK> mom says that the reality that should show <UNK> life is trash no offense he answers i don't take it like an offense this movie portrays a difficult life domino coming from a world that didn't want her ed mickey rourke a bounty hunter not so bounty <UNK> the third guy of the band which family is using <UNK> words the <UNK> <UNK> he's been and <UNK> the driver <UNK> coming from afghanistan during the russian <UNK> this bunch of people represents in some way the <UNK> born without the shirt unlucky violent and with nothing to lose <UNK> their as they would consider miserable lives the intro of the movie says that it is inspired by true story more or less so i couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true anyway going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons which could have been added to make the film easier to see and be classified as an action movie the characters' story is too realistic to be <UNK> br br the interaction between the characters is various well studied and definitely not boring what hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist lucy liu sober as never in her acting career it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story and that's a story probably the only con in a movie with a lot of pros br br all in all this isn't <UNK> the characters are crafted they have an identity a shape they have a name and a <UNK> not just <UNK> and street it's the case to say it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet
<START> cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget br br there are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style a definite highlight comes when a <UNK> goes through a run down of all <UNK> which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience as he makes his exit he <UNK> the client grant that perhaps he could achieve a <UNK> of 100 00 from the total or at least 50 00 but certainly 25 00 hilarious
<START> <UNK> was fun but it wasn't that great i guess i just didn't understand a lot of the <UNK> racing <UNK> and there was a lot of that in the film the plot wasn't what i expected from the disney channel previews so that could account for some of my disappointment
<START> i checked this out as an <UNK> when <UNK> through the movie store and couldn't have been any more pleasantly surprised my mom and i watched this film together and we thoroughly enjoyed it it isn't the typical chick flick with a sappy love story and tears all the way through but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end it's an ending where although unexpected and tragic the movie's overall effect is not <UNK> by it i think reese <UNK> was a great actress even in this film her debut and this is definitely worth watching i didn't recognize many of the supporting actors but they all play their important supporting roles well the man in the moon is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time most women can definitely relate to everything from <UNK> words her subtle <UNK> and her not so subtle emotions raging like the typical teenage girl while she's playing a character confused about love she does not come across as silly and immature which was much appreciated considering many movies today
<START> don't let my <UNK> criticism stop you from buying and watching this <UNK> schneider classic this movie was shot in a lower budget probably against the will of ernest <UNK> so he had to make due for example england is portrayed as <UNK> on germany by a will of the <UNK> victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by <UNK> ride alone they arrived their too quick this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented for the movie was <UNK> when she's told that she's queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen why <UNK> she showing her self up to the balcony to <UNK> her subjects low budget where the audience back then aware of these <UNK> i wonder how the critics felt <UNK> the <UNK> scene she meets prince albert but <UNK> excited about it <UNK> the meeting in the eating side of the <UNK> your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like my old kentucky home and old black joe what civil war songs in the <UNK> is <UNK> schneider being portrayed as scarlet where's <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> playing her too is adrian <UNK> <UNK> or ashley what was in <UNK> mind well this add to the camp it's unintentionally <UNK> queen <UNK> story this is the only reason you should collect it or see it <UNK> 11 <UNK> <UNK> germany and england are connected
<START> wow saw this last night and i'm still <UNK> from how good it was every character felt so real although most of them petty selfish a holes and the bizarre story middle aged widow starts <UNK> her daughter's <UNK> boyfriend felt utterly convincing top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the <UNK> daniel craig the latter coming across as the next david <UNK> br br and director roger <UNK> this is as far from <UNK> hill as it's possible to be thank god br br watch this movie
<START> steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy first on 'the daily <UNK> and then in various supporting roles in virgin carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly <UNK> on his strengths carell plays andy <UNK> a middle aged man living a quiet lonely life andy is a little odd but in an awkward nice guy sort of way one night while <UNK> with his co workers for the first time andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin his co workers david paul rudd jay <UNK> <UNK> and cal seth <UNK> initially <UNK> andy about his situation but it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that andy is and they resolve to help him out by <UNK> him in ending his virginity and so begins <UNK> quest into <UNK> andy is the quintessential innocent and the bulk of the humor <UNK> from his <UNK> to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film some of the humor is crude gross out stuff but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy in addition i found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life i'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama it's a rolling in your seats comedy still every good comedy i have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters a good comparison would be 'the wedding <UNK> from earlier this summer virgin has a similar humor but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes i particularly loved the ending of the film which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick without giving anything away it reminded me of <UNK> about <UNK> very light and fun it leaves you laughing and smiling which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy i would highly recommend
<START> first there is no way the remake can be as good because japanese society is quite different from <UNK> and plays such a major part in this film as explained in the opening narration it adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie there is slew of different supporting characters personalities each does there part in making this movie wonderful this movie is full of comedy that isn't vulgar in anyway like most of today's gross out comedies yet it can still have you laughing out loud the reality is in real life you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with etc this movie truly <UNK> that and shows that the natural good in people can overcome petty differences not to mention it makes for a great sub plot and much of the humor this is a story about dance that actually has a story and a good one at that there are a few back stories that are not out of place but actually support the main storyline truly a well written film the dancing is great too i happen to be a fan of any movie with dancing of any sort for that aspect however this movie goes beyond any other with dance in the fact that it is a story first and just happens to be written about dancing in <UNK> society highly recommended br br 10 out of 10
<START> before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as <UNK> because before watching this movie <UNK> was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of <UNK> will be great as <UNK> sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia <UNK> sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesn't make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of <UNK> and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned br br although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets <UNK> and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job <UNK> is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies

<START> when i saw this animation for first time i was 15 maybe i was really impressed it has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark the colors are not that <UNK> the characters don't talk much there are no long and boring conversations of this and that like in ghost in the shell with its dark pictures views of strange <UNK> and sense of magic it looks like one of those ancient <UNK> stories full of violence and horrendous creators enchanted <UNK> and deep <UNK> <UNK> by dragons <UNK> <UNK> and one mysterious hero to stop evil

<START> kolchak was a tv series that really didn't fit into any category part horror part comedy some social awareness thrown in and what we have is something that i think people weren't ready for it's a shame really as i've started to watch these shows on the <UNK> network i never saw the originals i realized how different and interesting it really was br br starring darren <UNK> as kolchak a reporter for the international news service and simon <UNK> as his always angry boss tony vincenzo the show followed the exploits of a chicago news reporter who more often than not became a part of the story himself as he searched the <UNK> city for modern day <UNK> that go <UNK> in the night the underlying charm of <UNK> really sets the show apart a somewhat goofy guy who always wears the same suit you cannot help but love him his jokes are great and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor <UNK> are downright hilarious br br the stories are for the most part pretty good and the acting is very good the 70's were not a great period for special effects and the show suffers for it but if you suspend disbelief what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it's time
<START> ok i wrote a <UNK> review b c the movie is awful as i was waiting another review for <UNK> of mine to pop up i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie look at all the positive reviews they all i say all come from <UNK> have have not rated any other movie other than this one <UNK> and wait till you to the <UNK> <UNK> review br br <UNK> the other movies <UNK> reviewed and had glowing <UNK> for oh shoot they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director holy window <UNK> batman br br joe tony you suck as writers and tony you couldn't direct out of a bad script no jobs for you br br always check positive reviews for a low rated movie
<START> i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i was so impressed everything about it was superb the acting the characters the story a believable child who grew into brave always willing to help others his mum must be proud i could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something it is the <UNK> fable tale with morals cute and scary <UNK> and <UNK> but nevertheless heartwarming folk a child <UNK> and <UNK> at school who becomes a hero picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the <UNK> mountain where he discovers the yokai who are amazing creations that brian <UNK> would be proud of and the evil <UNK> and his off <UNK> who definitely needed a hug these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with <UNK> objects like <UNK> and other mechanical things and these <UNK> into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill takashi a young boy is the one to become their <UNK> alongside a red man dragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that if it had been america they could have turned it into a <UNK> toy and sold it at all good toy stores the lines are good especially the don't try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy though i must admit that the end was a wee bit sad and not necessarily so cheers <UNK>
<START> here's yet another film from the 80's that most people just don't know exists this slow <UNK> the loving shots of the montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of <UNK> recent open range which also starred robert <UNK> and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you can't sleep or on a <UNK> sunday afternoon those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the <UNK> son while hunting the performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced glenn close robert <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are pitch perfect in their portrayals as are all the supporting players and young actors i especially liked how director cain who unfortunately hasn't directed anything of note since this except the first young guns gives us quiet little glimpses into everyone's personal grief we don't just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents but also the confused middle sister the <UNK> uncle his crazy wife and the dead <UNK> girlfriend what we essentially get here is the rural mid western answer to ordinary people there's also shades of david lynch's the straight story in some of the stoic <UNK> mid west morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the <UNK> they inhabit this is one of the better and more realistic tear <UNK> of the era and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there
<START> a new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor james stewart teamed with the equally brilliant director anthony mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future until that time stewart was mainly noted for an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> approach to family oriented comedies dramas and romances not that he wasn't already a multi talented hollywood star one of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as <UNK> <UNK> connor a sarcastic writer for a scandal <UNK> in the philadelphia story he had even done westerns before his portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot thomas <UNK> <UNK> jr in the comedy western <UNK> rides again helped make that film a classic but to most movie goers he was the all american <UNK> type mr smith or george <UNK> seldom was there a dark side to any of the characters he played br br anthony mann was associated with b flicks in the film noir mode raw deal side street and t men caught the eye of james stewart so the two gifted men combined their resources to produce some of the greatest hollywood westerns ever made winchester '73 and the man from <UNK> were the best but the others were almost as effective mann became a successful director of a films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all gary <UNK> man of the west stewart became <UNK> wealthy as a result of the <UNK> because he signed for part of the <UNK> in return for a <UNK> of the <UNK> he was usually paid a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on br br winchester '73 was also one of the first films maybe the first to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun each owner is part of the tale being told and it all comes together in the exciting showdown at the end of the movie which also holds a surprise for the viewer based on a story by stuart lake the tale centers on revenge and the <UNK> of the winchester '73 the year is <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> have been <UNK> by the <UNK> and <UNK> at little big horn the whites want revenge the native americans want their land and their way of life back this conflict leads to a confrontation between native <UNK> led by young bull young rock hudson showing his potential as an actor and a small <UNK> group <UNK> down in a canyon and joined by civilians lin <UNK> stewart his partner and life long pal high spade the underrated actor <UNK> mitchell and a couple trying to find themselves steve miller charles drake and lola manners shelley winters a <UNK> <UNK> with a kind heart among the horse soldiers are <UNK> tony curtis and james best late of the dukes of hazzard whose part is cut short by a bullet br br <UNK> <UNK> was in dodge city in <UNK> the movie has him as head <UNK> the fine actor will <UNK> later of the <UNK> looks like an older <UNK> in reality <UNK> was assistant <UNK> in dodge at the time just cutting his teeth on being a <UNK> lin <UNK> wins the winchester in a shooting contest but has it taken from him not long afterward by outlaw dutch henry brown stephen <UNK> and his henchmen <UNK> and high spade are after both dutch henry and the winchester for the remainder of the movie an even more sinister character emerges along the way <UNK> <UNK> dean played as evil <UNK> by dan duryea who threatens to steal the show from the other members of a stellar cast br br the winchester passes through several hands during the course of the film each time the transfer is intense one involves a <UNK> played to perfection by john mcintire other <UNK> are <UNK> with the scenario above all this plus the action keeps the viewer glued to the seat throughout the entire show br br as noted above the cast is first rate down to the smallest role look for other familiar faces in uncredited parts including the future sheriff of bonanza ray <UNK> and b western reliable <UNK> <UNK> guy <UNK>
<START> saw it yesterday night at the midnight slam of the festival des films du <UNK> in <UNK> what a disappointment this movie is clearly over rated by imdb fans the acting was only but regular the directing didn't bring anything new or interesting the plot lacks considerably the movie is all about those college <UNK> and the game they play making prank calls <UNK> <UNK> and on top of that you can predict the movie's end in the first five minutes if you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie you might like it if you don't this movie is not worth it
<START> the master of cheap erotic horror <UNK> <UNK> finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the playboy channel the <UNK> borrows heavily from everything that came before it from nightmare on elm street to evil dead but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable just barely the characters are cardboard the dialogue is wooden the story is paper thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a <UNK> bag put that all together and you have a <UNK> ball of <UNK> for a movie sometimes when i'm bored i like to eat paper watching this movie is a lot like that chew on it for 90 minutes and you're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no <UNK> value
<START> hobgoblins hobgoblins where do i begin br br this film gives <UNK> the hands of fate and future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made this one is fun to laugh at where as <UNK> was just painful to watch hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term 80's <UNK> the acting and i am using this term loosely is atrocious the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed the movie was the perfect vehicle for mst3k and that version is the only way to watch this mess this movie gives mike and the <UNK> lots of <UNK> to pull some of the funniest one liners they have ever done if you try to watch this without the help of mike and the <UNK> god help you
<START> how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it's terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table br br please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is <UNK> the networks and <UNK> quality programming that requires some thought to create
<START> the combination of reading the <UNK> and viewing this film has inspired my wife and i to new levels recently i was <UNK> a statement made by the artist thomas <UNK> in one of his inspirational books he states you and i were not designed to breathe the <UNK> air of five <UNK> traffic nor do i think god had banal television programs media hype worthless <UNK> and soul <UNK> in mind when he created the universe i hadn't seen a river runs through it in a couple of years but after <UNK> <UNK> statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye i watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book a must read i have always been frustrated in southern california but somehow got caught up in its <UNK> society the film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience god's creations a combination of <UNK> story and my desire to move back to the <UNK> has driven me to move to montana i want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape go fly fishing with me ride horses into nothing but open land and <UNK> <UNK> set in the <UNK> a place where you seldom worry about crime i look around <UNK> and all i see is shopping <UNK> rude <UNK> people in their <UNK> <UNK> miles of vehicles on <UNK> <UNK> gangs racial turmoil on the verge of violent <UNK> and everyone skeptical of each others intentions br br anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones there is a lot of deep thinking in this film the scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps <UNK> tension you should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life it takes a compassionate intelligent and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning if you don't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue tone light colour scenery camera angles movement etc then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks the fast and the furious is the greatest film granted it was entertaining but shallow br br the bottom line this film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you <UNK> rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together quality not <UNK>
<START> this is possibly the most boring movie in history i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor director roman polanski i think i would rather see the three <UNK> than ever watch this movie again it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage my apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked new coke as well i am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie it is slow dull and has no real plot you wait for <UNK> minutes for the movie to get started i understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around thank god disco and <UNK> company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the bay city <UNK> oh well just my thoughts
<START> i just watched this for the first time in a long time i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were and how witty the movie is i had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are with the scene at the <UNK> club in <UNK> bridge among the most romantic ever filmed br br anyone interested in politics or history will love the movie's <UNK> references anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunter niven and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the <UNK> br br my favorite movie remains odd man out made near the same time but this one is superb br br
<START> there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the <UNK> is concerned one either likes it very much <UNK> its sincerity its liberal point of view and fine acting or else <UNK> its obvious propaganda mediocre dialogue cardboard characters and overall <UNK> i fall very much in the latter category and found the film and play concerning the activities of european <UNK> in washington during wartime a <UNK> bore worthwhile mostly for the acting and even then only <UNK> that author <UNK> <UNK> was on the side of the angels is irrelevant her plays were written for people who shared her point of view and she seldom explored ideas that weren't already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the other side is even when i find myself in one hundred percent <UNK> with what she has to say as in <UNK> i still can't stand the way she says it her characters are unreal and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality she really had nothing new to say i thoroughly agree with the late mary <UNK> long <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> reputation some years ago for those who think the theatre is dead or in <UNK> and <UNK> for the good old days i urge a <UNK> at watch on the <UNK> as bad in its way as angels in america which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago
<START> this early film has its flaws a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance but it already clearly demonstrates hitchcock's <UNK> of editing and the use of powerful images it's also among the most <UNK> of his films <UNK> note for examples the weird <UNK> he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery br br its core though remains the final match which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing even though you know that the hero has to win it becomes quite believable that he will lose and the movement of his wife from the <UNK> corner to his <UNK> the final plot pay off is very well <UNK> with the progress of the match the <UNK> of the <UNK> do exactly what they should you can almost hear the <UNK> even though this is a silent film the visuals often have a surprisingly <UNK> feel to them the pacing becomes astonishingly rapid and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which <UNK> it br br the only dvd release with which i am familiar is that of <UNK> a public <UNK> company as with each hitchcock silent they've released they've attached various musical <UNK> mostly <UNK> to the action the sound editing is frequently sloppy and the sound quality <UNK> widely but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here br br this is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest it deserves an honorable place in both the hitchcock <UNK> and the <UNK> list of worthwhile boxing films
<START> first of all my heartfelt <UNK> to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same <UNK> as the fantastic <UNK> girl and local hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated while it's true that sequels are usually bar a few notable exceptions a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a <UNK> disguised <UNK> of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense in the case of <UNK> two girls bill <UNK> has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins on the one hand <UNK> the plot of <UNK> girl while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving scottish arms dealers <UNK> gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen he <UNK> a hopeless passion for the football playing dorothy although now thirty five gregory still <UNK> a hopeless passion but now for the football playing frances also sixteen despite the fact that music teacher <UNK> has made it clear that she is attracted to him his passion for frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old <UNK> there's no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all the main problem lies with the character of gregory himself in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old gregory who <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over at thirty five gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and <UNK> creature whose life is neither active nor comic outside of work his time is spent watching videos of noam <UNK> and reading magazines about international <UNK> as his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly <UNK> save two pointless scenes with his younger sister who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life we are left confused about what it is gregory really wants who he is and why he is the way he is why for example is he <UNK> why does he never see his father who is clearly still alive why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended why is he so interested in noam <UNK> and injustice why has he become so <UNK> why is he attracted to frances why isn't he attracted to <UNK> until the last twenty minutes of the film what in <UNK> name do <UNK> or frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting why does he continue to try and impress frances even after he and <UNK> have become an item and when their association threatens to completely <UNK> his life are we really to believe that a scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive <UNK> could manage to <UNK> media <UNK> but fall foul of a couple of school kids does gregory really think that <UNK> a handful of computers into the sea will change anything to make matters worse actor john gordon <UNK> attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy on top of that it's hard to feel any sympathy for or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing <UNK> while they both lie on a pile of gym <UNK> rather than being amusing it simply <UNK> of <UNK> it's hard to know what was going through bill <UNK> head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic i can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was <UNK> to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose <UNK> memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all that at least could have been the basis of a film which was <UNK> interesting and intelligent as it is <UNK> two girls adds up <UNK> wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and <UNK> even less <UNK> girl was responsible for <UNK> bill <UNK> career here's hoping that <UNK> two girls won't be responsible for sinking it
<START> like many americans i was first introduced to the works of <UNK> miyazaki when i saw spirited away i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki one of his earlier works is castle in the sky although it's still enjoyable it's not as good as spirited away though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair br br a young boy named <UNK> james van der <UNK> is working in a mine late one night when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky when she wakes up the next morning she introduces herself as <UNK> anna <UNK> but <UNK> has a secret and before he knows it <UNK> is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates the army and a lost floating city br br going into a film by <UNK> miyazaki means you can expect one thing a sense of wonder and magic many filmmakers have tried but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood br br because the film is animated dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words it also helps that the translated dialogue is well written and voiced by talented actors the voice acting is varied james van der <UNK> <UNK> best he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of <UNK> that is perfect for the character anna <UNK> is nearly as good as <UNK> she's frightened by the events going on around her but she knows what she has to do mark <UNK> is <UNK> as the evil <UNK> he's dangerous and wants something from <UNK> and will do anything to get it the other voices are bad <UNK> <UNK> is awful as <UNK> <UNK> may have won an oscar for the last picture show but she's annoying as the pirate leader <UNK> gives the character an obnoxious <UNK> that's nearly always monotonous it's so bad it nearly ruins the film jim <UNK> is an effective voice over actor but he's miscast as the general br br i would definitely recommend seeing castle in the sky i'll probably end up buying it myself but even though it's not as good as spirited away it's still pretty good
<START> wow what a <UNK> <UNK> one of <UNK> worst films the bad acting coupled with a <UNK> if not <UNK> script make me <UNK> for time i wasted on viewing this on cable television back not really much i can say about it a basketball <UNK> gets too attached to the person he's <UNK> who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by spoiler a basketball game grade f
<START> there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen br br <UNK> fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro films first off it's a republic serial in 12 chapters and this time zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks <UNK> power or antonio <UNK> but instead by <UNK> like actor reed hadley while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other he does an adequate job helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here as the title implies he has a fighting legion to call upon br br another big difference is that the setting isn't california the story here take place in central mexico in <UNK> where a man posing as a living god <UNK> the <UNK> indian population and a band of <UNK> to aid him in his plan to <UNK> the newly established mexican republic something zorro and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop br br don't get me wrong there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode from corny <UNK> bow sound effects to ludicrous acting but overall this represents one of the best republic serials of all time and probably the best zorro one br br the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering and there's lots of great action fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial
<START> i watched <UNK> <UNK> the movie theater and i liked the movie spite of the fact that <UNK> <UNK> many flaws and scientific errors like humans <UNK> dinosaurs and <UNK> living at the same period and even the location of where the story passes looks north america but has some characteristics from <UNK> for example we can have fun even so unless you are very severe br br the planet is entering an ice age and many animals are <UNK> to the south where is <UNK> sid is a stupid <UNK> that is left behind by his own family that can't stand him any longer walking in his way he meets <UNK> or how he calls <UNK> <UNK> a moody <UNK> who does not care about <UNK> or <UNK> and is going to the north worried that he can easily be captured sid decides to follow <UNK> and in the middle of their journey they found a human mother with her baby the mother dies but <UNK> and sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans diego one of the <UNK> decides to follow and help them to go to a <UNK> to the <UNK> camp what <UNK> and sid does not know is that diego is from a <UNK> clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby and also pretend to <UNK> they both to make they become <UNK> food what will happen will depend of <UNK> behavior and conscience br br aka a era do <UNK> brazil
<START> i was the production <UNK> on this movie and i also got to do some voice over work on it so i'm not entirely <UNK> but if it were awful i would say so i thought it was a fun film not a <UNK> acclaimed masterpiece by any means but there were plenty of laughs along the way the bible states that laughter does good like a medicine so watching this movie could be good for your health br br so many of the actors in this picture hadn't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film susan sarandon of course is one who has since gone on to much greater fame <UNK> <UNK> was seen on tv on a weekly basis as a photographer in the thirty something tv drama series robert englund later became known as <UNK> krueger still haunting people's dreams one of my personal favorite actors on this show was dub taylor who played the sheriff he was an excellent comedic actor and a truly nice sincere person we all had fun working on this show and i think that fun comes through
<START> ok maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie its about this <UNK> rat who lives in a palace then a <UNK> rat <UNK> him down a toilet he ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants he will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats he plans to take the gem and to <UNK> rat city the cool part about this movie is the slugs they do all the sound effects they sing make noises its awesome its also pretty funny ok bottom line it is aimed at 7 year olds other wise a great movie to take a younger family member to see i didn't think the animation was real <UNK> art though more like wallace and <UNK> i <UNK> <UNK> a little on that the movie was just decent not worth spending 9 50 for though sorry
<START> the true story of the friendship that <UNK> south africa and <UNK> the world br br richard attenborough who directed a bridge too far and gandhi wanted to bring the story of steve biko to life and the journey and trouble that journalist donald woods went through in order to get his story told the films uses <UNK> two books for it's information and basis biko and asking for trouble br br the film takes place in the late 1970's in south africa south africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and <UNK> the whites as the superior race the blacks are forced to live in <UNK> on the <UNK> of the cities and towns and they come under frequent <UNK> by the police and the army we are shown a dawn raid on a <UNK> as <UNK> and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants then we are introduced to donald woods kevin kline who is the editor of a popular newspaper after <UNK> a negative story about black <UNK> steve biko denzel washington woods goes to meet with him the two are <UNK> of each other at first but they soon become good friends and biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to woods this encourages woods to speak out against what's happening around him and makes him desperate to bring steve <UNK> story out of the <UNK> of the white man's south africa and to the world soon steve biko is arrested and is killed in prison now woods and his family are daring to escape from south africa to england where woods can <UNK> his book about steve biko and the apartheid br br when i first heard of cry freedom i was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of steve biko i had never actually heard of steve biko before i seen this film as the events in this film were really before my time but it's more about the story of donald woods and his journey across the border into <UNK> as he tried to <UNK> the south african officials woods was put on a five year type house arrest after steve biko was killed so in order to <UNK> his <UNK> on steve biko he had to escape because the <UNK> would be considered <UNK> in south africa and that could have resulted in woods meeting a fate similar to that of <UNK> the real donald woods and his wife acted as <UNK> to this film br br denzel washington is only in the film for the first hour and i was disappointed with that as i was expecting to see him for the entire movie but he was amazing as steve biko and captured his personality from what i've read really well and his accent sounded perfect his performance earned him an oscar nomination for best supporting actor kevin kline delivers a excellent and thought <UNK> performance as donald woods and penelope <UNK> is excellent as his wife wendy br br filming took place in <UNK> as needless to say problems <UNK> when they tried to film it in south africa while in south africa the south african <UNK> followed the film crew everywhere so they got the bad <UNK> and they pulled out and went to <UNK> <UNK> instead despite everything and the fact that the apartheid didn't end <UNK> seven years later cry freedom wasn't banned in south africa but cinemas showing the movie received bomb <UNK> br br richard attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination he doesn't hold back at the end of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a <UNK> turns into a massacre when police open fire on them the film ends with the names of all the anti apartheid <UNK> who died in prison and the explanations for their deaths many had no explanation quite a few were <UNK> which is hard to believe and many more either fell from the top of the stairs or were suicide from hanging no one will ever know what really happened to them but i think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands but at the hands of others or to be more precise at the hands of the police br br cry freedom is a must see movie for it's portrayal and story of steve biko it's also a <UNK> and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the <UNK> grips of racial <UNK> and violence
<START> ever notice how in his later movies burt <UNK> laugh sounds like <UNK> <UNK> br br must have been hanging out with hal <UNK> too much br br and from the looks of <UNK> ace way too much br br can you believe this was based on a book neither could i but it was and probably not a best <UNK> i'll <UNK> br br <UNK> another good old boy in the <UNK> circuit who <UNK> up with beatty as a fried chicken <UNK> with designs on his team anderson provides what love interest there is and <UNK> does his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> impression as faithful mechanic best friend <UNK> br br a lot of people here are friends of <UNK> or <UNK> others must have needed the work and even real <UNK> drivers get in on the act and look to have more talent than those with <UNK> cards br br as far as laughs go <UNK> smith pre police academy gets them as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in full elvira mode gets lots of <UNK> <UNK> as a lady who wants to get to know <UNK> real well real well br br it's a shame that burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like <UNK> ace where it didn't matter whether he bothered to act or not they didn't bother to write a character for him why bother to act br br two stars mostly for <UNK> and for the out takes at the end now they're funny
<START> i was able to watch this movie in its entirety and was deeply moved by it i wasn't sure if it was really a comedy or a drama it had elements of both mary tyler moore and valerie <UNK> both looked wonderful our image of 60 year old women has certainly changed since aunt <UNK> they are vibrant beautiful sexy the only <UNK> in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in either the <UNK> or <UNK> shows from the 1970's i'd have thought that since it was set in new york city where <UNK> had been set that at least some mention would have been made of her sister brenda or that julie <UNK> would have appeared assuming of course she was still in the big apple br br it is my hope that abc will make this a series and bring back for guest appearances all the old casts of these shows by the way what was wrong with cbs doing this reunion or an eventual series wasn't that the network that carried the <UNK> and <UNK> shows
<START> how can a movie that features the singing of curtis <UNK> be bad it can't the groove tube is a series of <UNK> black out sketches that makes fun of anything from 2001 to the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the clown the easy <UNK> recipe <UNK> the <UNK> an all too long the dealers but even the <UNK> are funny best of all is ken <UNK> manic dance down a busy manhattan sidewalk that is <UNK> not <UNK> king cole singing just you just me definitely dated now but at the time the groove tube was <UNK> bold shameless and hysterically funny ken <UNK> made this minor cult hit then 7 years later made the christmas day opening bomb modern problems though i enjoyed it and since then unfortunately nothing he could possibly be playing drums in a jazz group the groove tube remains to me an <UNK> burst of positive energy a movie that 26 years after my initial viewing still brings me real joy
<START> love this film also saw it when it was first shown <UNK> germany in a small independent cinema in <UNK> it was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to the erotic of the movie hit the <UNK> and the discussion with <UNK> <UNK> the producer and director was always <UNK> by that in his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie br br it doesn't exist much copies of that film <UNK> <UNK> came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for tv as well before he became a sort of <UNK> br br for the people who wish to see that movie again you could find it on his <UNK> which isn't that easy to search for but its possible
<START> as much as i like japanese movies this one didn't just cut it a movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a <UNK> plot br br the photography is ok though i've seen much better sword fight scenes in other japanese movies the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn't convince me at all the soundtrack is so weak you don't even notice its presence but worst of all was the way the plot evolved i have to admit that at some times i had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on anyway the <UNK> love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a hollywood influence br br all in all if your looking for an action japanese movie this isn't it its very slow with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental in a bad way
<START> ok we all love the daisy dukes but what is up with this cast lets start jessica simpson as daisy there is not one thing country about this girl and daisy was not <UNK> uncle jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original no offense to burt but i never noticed boss <UNK> being so tall that was part of the humor of boss <UNK> was his size did they even try someone like danny <UNK> ok now get this they cast jessica simpson did anyone take a look at her husband he matches luke duke to a <UNK> <UNK> these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members the screen <UNK> were never present on the dukes this made the movie a turn off from the beginning i give this a huge thumbs down
<START> one of the most <UNK> great works of animation though it makes the most sophisticated use of the cut out method of animation a la south park the real talent behind twice upon a time are the vocal characterizations with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from tv's <UNK> woody allen ish ralph the all purpose animal being the <UNK> the accidental nightmare sequence is <UNK> one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed
<START> this was obviously the prototype for mick <UNK> but 'the adventures of barry <UNK> is funnier i was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times terrific central performance by barry <UNK> in the title role an australian who <UNK> england to upset the <UNK> with his free flowing <UNK> ways few brits will be upset by <UNK> frequently cruel observations on his <UNK> the <UNK> between the two countries is <UNK> but friendly and this is <UNK> by the film's final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant <UNK> as he boards the plane home i was just starting to like the <UNK>
<START> i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera <UNK> <UNK> but was pleased to find a fast paced script an underlying moral excellent portrayals from all the actors especially peter <UNK> amazing special effects suspense and beautiful cinematography there's even a shot of the <UNK> stone <UNK> recently destroyed by the <UNK> not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most <UNK> beautiful and sympathetic before she gave in to the <UNK> <UNK> that marred her later work all the supporting players round it out and i do wonder who trained all those elephants br br speaking of the stone <UNK> sequence you really can <UNK> that it's <UNK> leigh in the long shots her shape and the way she moves is distinct from <UNK> the only thing <UNK> that sequence are the poorly done process shots where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk br br if you want a thought provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring spend a few hours with elephant walk
<START> i had planned to write something explaining what i didn't like about this movie but this is going to be more difficult than i thought honestly i can't remember much about it i watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me that's usually the sign of a real stinker about the only thing i remember was being incredibly bored by most of it the novelty of having a <UNK> bogart look a like as the detective wore off real quick it would be different if he could act but he's a one note entertainer the kill scenes were <UNK> handled and there was no suspense leading up to them if you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie you need to see more euro horror the casting is a dead <UNK> to the killer's identity
<START> i bought a dvd of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film and enjoys movies about the <UNK> the movie was shot entirely on video so it has the look of a <UNK> special about it the special effects are <UNK> looking but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat there is a particularly effective scare involving a virgin mary statue br br however the acting is bad the plot scenes are long and very boring and i will tell you i have no clue what happened at the end if you get the movie rent it if you buy it please make sure you pay less than 5
<START> the freedom of having your own sea going power boat the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged <UNK> man of an <UNK> and lovely and so well <UNK> <UNK> in fine <UNK> were all definite selling points for sea hunt 1958 <UNK> br br just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going gun for hire series let's look closely now there must be a some clues around br br if we were to look back just a little we see the rko radio pictures production of underwater 1955 it starred jane russell gilbert <UNK> richard <UNK> and <UNK> nelson as a <UNK> of very attractive <UNK> diving <UNK> working on salvage in the <UNK> including a pre <UNK> cuba the film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits fine <UNK> women folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits woo woo woo woo are always a plus for the guys and the presence of rugged athletic men folk displaying their best <UNK> poses is equally pleasing to the <UNK> br br and there is one element that is a true legacy of this old rko feature it is on the soundtrack contained in between the musical <UNK> and themes it is the recording of it's <UNK> pink and apple <UNK> white written by <UNK> and jacques <UNK> and performed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his orchestra br br anyone who hears this <UNK> or song with lyrics will not soon forget it its <UNK> beat is so very lively and its rich use of the <UNK> section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly <UNK> instant impression and memory the 45 <UNK> record of this song made it to the top 10 most popular songs of the week for many saturday <UNK> on nbc tv's your hit parade we can't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got maybe some one can fill us in on that one item please so we got back to sea hunt and its own odyssey in getting on the tube the public had taken to underwater all right but would they go for a tv series br br <UNK> tv productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that for the most part didn't get signed on by the networks for the multi station hook up treatment but they had been having some great <UNK> with television <UNK> by that we mean offering a series for stations for <UNK> on a one to a tv station per each market area much like the various newspaper <UNK> sell comic <UNK> to various papers around the country and world even br br so we got <UNK> <UNK> himself in the physical presence of lloyd bridges mr bridges had been around for approximately 15 years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of boston <UNK> movies with <UNK> morris to they <UNK> to <UNK> 3 stooges 1943 <UNK> also 1943 home of the brave 1949 and the <UNK> at <UNK> falls 1951 br br lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization along with a fine convincingly athletic <UNK> having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities he took very well as the <UNK> diver whether it's performing duties on board ship or <UNK> beneath the sea br br and lloyd did take to the role quickly but contrary to a lot of <UNK> out there he was not familiar with s c u b a prior to landing this mike nelson gig but the athletic mr bridges proved to be a quick <UNK> as so many of the close up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it that it was lloyd with the mask the <UNK> air tank and the <UNK> <UNK> br br stories almost always involved the helping out some client for pay much like a private detective would so what if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in the bathing suit all the better br br like so many of the other <UNK> united artists tv productions sea hunt possessed a fine haunting opening theme and closing along with some original incidental music and <UNK> br br at one time i believe that sea hunt was the top <UNK> tv series a success that <UNK> series had known before with the likes of science fiction theatre and highway <UNK> as far as the showing <UNK> for this underwater saga here in chicago it was shown late night after 10 30 p m on <UNK> tv channel 5 our nbc <UNK> now known as <UNK> tv br br and i can remember just who was the original <UNK> in this particular market was and there were even on scene commercials done by the star how well we can remember and <UNK> lloyd as mike nelson riding on his power boat and as we were being invited to return the next week and watch another adventure of sea hunt <UNK> by the g <UNK> <UNK> company of <UNK> <UNK> the makers of old style <UNK> beer all while mike was <UNK> us raising an old style bottle shame on you mike drinking beer on your moving boat we're <UNK> the coast guard then the boat would leave the <UNK> accompanied by the sea hunt theme and rolling the credits br br note more <UNK> than literal mike was for hire and things ran very much like a <UNK> story br br note <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> included science fiction theatre west point and its clone men of <UNK> sea hunt and highway <UNK> br br note and of course <UNK> is a <UNK> for self contained underwater breathing <UNK>
<START> i simply could not finish this movie i tuned out after what i would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award a scene in which pia <UNK> at a <UNK> stands between two boys who want her one the good boy <UNK> for her to see the error of her ways the other the bad boy simply asks if she'd like a hot dog which he then holds out for her at <UNK> level i hope i'm not spoiling anything to say she turns and takes the hot dog with a smile just pathetic
<START> my baby <UNK> was a fan so i saw many of the older episodes while growing up i'm not a fan of scooby doo so i'm not sure why i left the tv on when this show premiered to my surprise i found it enjoyable to me shaggy and scooby were the only interesting characters <UNK> tomatoes from fans of the others so i like that they only focus on those two however this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it i like the voice acting especially dr <UNK> <UNK> i liked listening to him even before i knew he was jeff bennett and jim <UNK> as <UNK> sounds to me like he's really enjoying his job as an actor i also get a kick out of the <UNK> with their slightly <UNK> personalities and their desires to play <UNK> and dragons or act out scenes from star wars not called by those names in the show of course
<START> not the greatest film to remember paul naschy by br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is probably the worst <UNK> i have ever seen zorro would be ashamed his only salvation came as the competition was just as bad br br this film is described as adventure and horror forget the horror there is none no nudity no blood no monsters just a robin hood adventure against an evil baron paul naschy who wants to be king br br the main feature of the film was seeing <UNK> <UNK> who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our <UNK> loss where did she go
<START> to be honest i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater big mistake because the 1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and 2 is the cinematography try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level and a commercial potential the more i see it the more i like it br br it's definitely one of <UNK> <UNK> best movie this guy knows about action die hard 2 the long kiss good bye etc and it's particularly good in this movie the special effect are great and spectacular stallone really needed that movie get back with success still good to see him
<START> so this made for tv film scores only a 7 6 on this site <UNK> <UNK> without question this 1984 version of <UNK> classic tale is the best ever made and yes the <UNK> has seen the 1951 version which was also good but not good enough the lack of color is perhaps the biggest <UNK> of that version although the acting was wonderful br br george c scott is simply incredible as <UNK> scrooge we all know the story of this <UNK> businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner then by three other spirits later on that evening scott is properly gruff as scrooge too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new found glee that he <UNK> to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson but hey this is george c scott he's never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy he has too much dignity and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner br br the supporting performances are uniformly excellent as are the costumes music and scenery 19th century london comes to life in clive <UNK> <UNK> style the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits the important tale of morality shines through in every frame though br br you won't often find this version aired on television anymore and that is a disappointment the 1984 version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every <UNK> celebration of the holiday when the <UNK> come out of the basement this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the season br br 10 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> it's a pretty good cast but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original italian comedy big deal on madonna street anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original william macy may be one of our greatest living actors but here he's put to little use and his role in the original was played by <UNK> mastroianni so i sort of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes might as well try to imitate bogart or a young de niro the art direction is rich and <UNK> but brings nothing to the story the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed even starting the way they do seems <UNK> gratuitous and takes away from the surprise of the original sam <UNK> has his odd and <UNK> charm and luis <UNK> has that odd charisma but the love story part of the movie just seems clunky and flat it's too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made but then again it's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to remake amazing things instead of simply learning to <UNK> the originals
<START> la <UNK> et la <UNK> has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released post <UNK> and eternal in many respects true the actors don't act true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying the very long monologue spoken by <UNK> <UNK> is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about <UNK> <UNK> and love not easy to translate accurately though this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman or two women in this case and imho jean pierre <UNK> is one of the greatest french actors
<START> sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything great story great fights great characters and great cameos br br this film sees dick <UNK> take on billy <UNK> and chong fat sammo takes on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a casino sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high <UNK> action and elements of comedy thrown in br br some great and touching moments in the film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pops up in a cameo and gets killed off <UNK> br br the end sequence will have you reaching for the <UNK> button as its one of the best end fights i've seen sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up <UNK> up to billy <UNK>
<START> just came back from the first showing of basic instinct 2 i was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and i was pleasantly surprised if you liked the original basic instinct i think you will enjoy 2 just as much if not more great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking the music is superb <UNK> the <UNK> theme don't go expecting academy award material go to see it for enjoyment and fun that's what movies are designed for <UNK> i can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with sharon stone who is as sexy as she ever was am thinking about going to see it again this weekend go see it
<START> 1933 seemed to be a great year for <UNK> duck soup for instance and this one fits in well even though it is about the obsession with contract bridge the tone is like a humorous piece from the new <UNK> appropriate since the film begins with the goings on about town page of that magazine the only thing odd is the casting made a few years later william powell and myrna loy would have been perfect however after 1934 you wouldn't have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion the young and beautiful loretta young in some <UNK> and <UNK> outfits or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio even if you know nothing about bridge you may still want to check out a rare example of hollywood satire
<START> cause they're both pretty lousy i think the best part of the movie is the <UNK> <UNK> picture of faye <UNK> at the top of the stairs she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture rip someone to bloody pieces and <UNK> re enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened now you know a movie's in trouble when part of the set <UNK> manages to attract your attention br br i admit i paid 30 for the dvd just so i could see faye <UNK> in a contemporary horror movie i know what you're thinking 30 bucks right down into a <UNK> black hole and you would be absolutely correct this movie sucks there it's right out in the open i was expecting some actual scares and i waited and waited and waited none came the <UNK> probably a crow in makeup didn't scare me seeing small pieces of internal organs didn't scare me and even faye didn't scare me i'm not that brave i know so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble what's more jennifer wasn't scared either her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more <UNK> than anything her life was rapidly coming to a close and she's worried about <UNK> more money honey you can't take money where you're going i need money she continually says completely ignoring the fact that her <UNK> have <UNK> and <UNK> to function br br meanwhile i spent the whole <UNK> movie wondering what was up with the grandmother faye i was suspicious at first faye playing a grandmother and all and i was still suspicious at the end there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother from hell are forced to share <UNK> and i'm guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother here's the weird part the relative looks like she's just endured her eight <UNK> birthday party mary ellen looks like she's just gotten a face lift from a renowned surgeon face lifts can't work <UNK> but i think <UNK> appearance is important to the rice paper plot spoiler it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting sorry my little joke seriously though there's all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately <UNK> <UNK> huh interestingly enough mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact how did she avoid the family curse <UNK> up with her obviously br br another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars this movie features one of my all time movie pet <UNK> i refer to the double ending this movie ends twice i absolutely hate it when that happens and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending didn't like it and forget to remove it during editing i guess it's supposed to be scary but it is only if you're a film editor br br there is one <UNK> to this <UNK> though and it's one of the reasons i bought the dvd the filmmaker commentary features faye <UNK> and i wanted to see how she acted when she didn't have lines to <UNK> guess what the movie sucked so bad i wasn't able to sit through it again <UNK>
<START> this is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders the storyline <UNK> on a deranged man who lives in texas us who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being <UNK> by god to redeem the world of bad people br br bill paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged father who is known as the hand of god killer while matthew <UNK> plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son <UNK> <UNK> the film revolves around <UNK> who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to <UNK> tell the story to fbi agent wesley doyle played by powers <UNK> br br i cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer <UNK> to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them even if you want to stop watching you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie br br the directors have filmed this movie very well and they help to set the plot through the good scenery the acting in this movie is great but if there is any <UNK> it is that some parts are very powerful and may <UNK> some people br br whilst the concept of this film is very dark the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting this really is a spine <UNK> movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different br br 8 10
<START> based on a self serving novel by one time girl friend and <UNK> of f scott fitzgerald <UNK> <UNK> sheila graham wrote this trashy story gregory peck carries on in shameless excess as a <UNK> be drunk or be damned alcoholic in <UNK> to the gentle and soft spoken real scott fitzgerald focusing on <UNK> hollywood writing era late in his life the much <UNK> author was in fact living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when <UNK> was not yet well known fitzgerald was none too proud to be <UNK> his <UNK> stories in order to support both his wife in a mental hospital and his daughter in college living in a small apartment and driving a second hand <UNK> his life was <UNK> degrees different than as portrayed in this movie br br virtually every 20th century fox movie made during <UNK> f <UNK> <UNK> as well as virtually every film directed by henry king was a work of excellence beloved <UNK> was the exception
<START> it appears that there's no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams it's often foolish and illogical it's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angel br br <UNK> deadpan <UNK> insults and various other faux <UNK> at the dream reception are hilarious and her <UNK> with <UNK> barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she gets to sing a <UNK> from carmen followed by the final trio of <UNK> holding a <UNK> for some strange reason then <UNK> <UNK> on the beach br br it's a surreal comedy tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
<START> the odd couple is the classic film version of neil simon's most famous play about a tv <UNK> named felix <UNK> who is an obsessive neat freak who moves in with his divorced best friend oscar madison a <UNK> and complete <UNK> after his wife frances throws him out of their apartment already divorced oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it neil simon's classic comedy first came to broadway with art <UNK> playing felix and walter matthau playing oscar jack lemmon takes over for <UNK> in the film version with a memorable performance as felix <UNK> lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is felix <UNK> matthau fortunately was allowed to recreate his role as oscar a one of a kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout this <UNK> of lemmon and matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re visited in nine other films with both of these actors no longer with us the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious simon's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue <UNK> a depressed <UNK> suicide attempt that is a winner the supporting cast includes <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> larry haines and david <UNK> as <UNK> poker playing buddies and <UNK> evans and carole shelley as the <UNK> sisters blind dates of oscar and felix of course it later became an excellent tv series with tony randall and jack <UNK> but there's nothing like the original a joy from start to finish
<START> after watching some of <UNK> great stuff band of brothers rome etc i must say i had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of true blood <UNK> often the script seemed to be written by an 8 year old some parts are just horribly filmed the scene in which she saves bill i mean come on she throws a chain at the guy and <UNK> it goes around his neck and it magically <UNK> him that was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion or a few moments before that scene when she finds out that the couple is gone with bill ridiculous she hears them plan their stuff and like 5 seconds later magic the 3 of them are gone and without any struggle or noise or anything br br i mean the idea of the show seemed interesting mysterious intriguing vampires co existing with human in our modern society but honestly i don't think they really wanted to make more of this than a petty soap show that the average teen girl watches all the time but that nobody else cares about unfortunately the script is written poorly mediocre at best it's shallow and extremely predictable often i thought that this was some kind of a joke or something br br the actors deliver really unconvincing performances if you want my opinion they seem to take the show very lightly as if it were some kind of a regular low budget family tv show well maybe thats what it is if you take away the family part the only actor that seemed somewhat good to me was stephen <UNK> in the role of bill considering the poorly written extremely short replies he had to say what are you can i give you a call sometime i think he did good in bringing out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role must have actually anna <UNK> was okay as well but not more but the guy playing her brother though <UNK> he's horrible the scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television the acting is bad the construction site looks fake to the bone and the two other guys why is he getting arrested uh i <UNK> that was pretty embarrassing br br another thing that i think was completely missed was the way they presented <UNK> psychic powers they make us hear what people think and speak both at the same time and thats just wrong often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic as if people's thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel and that when she comes close to em she hits the right <UNK> level and has to hear everything that they think br br and finally the sex scenes are just <UNK> unnecessary and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting br br don't get me wrong i wrote all these comments not because i thought the show was bad but because i was very disappointed i expected quality stuff i didn't think it was going to be like that it's definitely not a good show though mediocre at best
<START> this show is beautifully done when it first came out i though it nothing more than a light hearted family comedy with quite a few good one liners it seemed to express many families really well too with different concepts of both parent and child however like i said i never thought any more of it then a good watch on an evening however my view was shot out the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny john ritter <UNK> the programme stood it's ground and really <UNK> the characters life in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admire <UNK> of john ritter a fantastic actor with the talent to do anything when the show aired after <UNK> passing i really wanted to just give my dad a hug and let him know how much he meant to me i thought this <UNK> threw the acting talents of the three children particularly that of <UNK> character who was worried of the last words she said to him it reminded me that no matter what horrible things i say to my dad i don't mean them and it's very important that he knows this great show
<START> this is such a great movie to watch with young children i'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over over gena was good cheech was fun the russian was good maria was adorable of course paulie was the best
<START> it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama <UNK> and for good reason they are <UNK> wooden and pretentious <UNK> of bergman and let's not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of allen's bergman <UNK> allen's whining <UNK> to the contrary notwithstanding what i don't get is this why was allen generally <UNK> for his originality in imitating bergman but the <UNK> brian <UNK> was <UNK> for ripping off hitchcock in his suspense horror films in robin <UNK> view it's a strange form of cultural <UNK> i would have to agree with that
<START> the viewer leaves wondering why he bothered to watch this one or why for that matter anyone bothered to make it there is no plot just random scenes of ridiculous action <UNK> <UNK> shower scene appeals to the male <UNK> but that's not much reason to make a movie
<START> this movie has it all sight gags subtle jokes play on words and <UNK> it is about a <UNK> tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat a common enemy if you watch this more than once you will find you are <UNK> it like animal house and yes i love animal house also i put in the top 15 funniest movies the major at a boys military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause trouble in this movie he is right he is sadistic <UNK> cruel and has to be taken down the group of boys that do not get along at first end up <UNK> together to survive and get rid of the major with a wacky plan only mad magazine could of wrote a must see you will love it
<START> charles bronson stars as lt <UNK> a police detective who declares war on a <UNK> named duke juan <UNK> who kidnaps the daughter of a japanese businessman who is the man who sexually <UNK> <UNK> daughter amy <UNK> in this sleazy yet <UNK> <UNK> revenge thriller <UNK> may not be for everyone with it's somewhat disturbing plot threads but it is well made and indeed entertaining
<START> a quite usual trashy <UNK> western stupid storyline full of clichés and lack of logic some mediocre actors dirty settings lots of punch fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale br br this has nothing to do with <UNK> at least not in my german translated version this german dvd release is called <UNK> <UNK> and has macho <UNK> fighting against butch cassidy and <UNK> because their gang killed his one he's the only survivor then you have butch cassidy and <UNK> fighting each other because they <UNK> and the gang split and you have <UNK> fighting against everyone because he's just the biggest and most greedy <UNK> anyway yeah that's it no more <UNK> in the storyline <UNK> br br a small role by <UNK> kinski as <UNK> <UNK> is remarkable that's why i bought this dvd in one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming i said love and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing <UNK> and goes nuts for a second <UNK> br br it's also remarkable that joe <UNK> aka <UNK> <UNK> did the cinematography i love this master of incompetent exploitation <UNK> so it was an <UNK> for me
<START> in this grim melodrama barbara stanwyck plays the <UNK> of three wealthy sisters who become <UNK> when their father dies in france threatened with the danger of losing the <UNK> family home big sister makes a grand sacrifice and secretly marries a real estate <UNK> so she can <UNK> her <UNK> fortune a few years later she learns that he is after the family estate and wants to tear it down so she leaves him and tries to stop him more time passes and the husband ends up taking her to court when he learns that she has <UNK> him a son without telling him the part of gig young was played by actor byron <UNK> who later assumed the name before he became famous br br anyone interested in <UNK> a copy let me know by writing to me at <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> ten out of ten stars br br it's hard to believe this was a made for television movie just the phrase made of tv makes me <UNK> the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios that being said this version of the christmas carol should have been released in theaters because it is that good it's my personal favorite of all the christmas carol movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality yes there are some minor on screen <UNK> with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes br br scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge he's a pleasure to watch in fact i can't think of one performance in this film that shouldn't be <UNK> the <UNK> location shooting and winter backdrop are mesmerizing the musical score is endearing and heart warming add to that solid directing flawless cinematography and faithful scripting we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic it really hasn't been around long enough to be a classic but mark my words one day soon it will be this film has turned into a <UNK> christmas tradition in my home because it <UNK> the true meaning behind christmas love <UNK> and giving in as selfish greedy world my family and i can lose ourselves in the christmas carol starring george c scott
<START> back in 1994 i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation <UNK> and the holiday itself i stayed in town during that time hanging out at my parents' house a lot br br i didn't have a tv in my apartment so i used to watch my parents' tube i had just finished watching a segment of the x files when a program came on called personal fx i was hooked instantly i had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> and often wondered about their history value etc br br after my long vacation i used to go to my <UNK> house on my lunch hours just to catch personal fx br br i can remember one episode during which co host claire carter announced that the new york apartment in which the series was filmed was being <UNK> and that once said <UNK> were complete that <UNK> fx would return to the air br br it never did personal fx was the first and best of the <UNK> shows and it <UNK> from the air almost fifteen years later i'm still sore br br way to go fx
<START> the power of <UNK> <UNK> is director hong sang <UNK> second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film including the multiple connected <UNK> in this case two and stories of troubled or <UNK> relationships as well as a potent <UNK> of irony br br one thing that's clearly reduced from his previous work is the <UNK> of fancy that included elements of <UNK> however this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found <UNK> the two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to <UNK> <UNK> with her friends only to find herself drawn to a stranger the second about a man who also goes on a trip to <UNK> <UNK> with his friend and struggles with his relationship <UNK> br br again hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet i don't think he's entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters drawing in just enough compassion to <UNK> the criticism he draws with his irony i think the think i've come to love about <UNK> films is that they just feel so real especially the complex and conflicted characters not to say that every person is a <UNK> or suffering from confused feelings but rather that these characters he and the actors present feel fully developed and believable br br this is not a fast moving film there's a lot of lingering and like the previous film things don't always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways there doesn't appear to be any element of the film that isn't intentionally placed in the film and it's made my a little hyper aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses br br power is an excellent film that manages to <UNK> a level of personal emotion regret longing into a story that highlights irony and the <UNK> of human decision making it's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how hong manages to pull it off twice in a row technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear this film doesn't pack the same emotional <UNK> that the first does but <UNK> a lot in its assured exploration and the <UNK> really helps <UNK> the overall vision great viewing for art cinema lovers 8 10
<START> the show is about two sisters living together holly being the younger one has some teenage problems on the other hand her sister val has job boy friend fiancé problems like most of the women on the planet they try to support each other they make mistakes sometimes but they don't give up and continue and the show is also about friendship the <UNK> in life i loved this show so much it is funny and the actors are so good i am really sad that the show is over i still watch the reruns time to time amanda <UNK> is very talented jenny <UNK> may be new to comedy but she plays really well she is one of the actresses i like watching i like vince and <UNK> relationship they are very natural gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh each time he shows up with tina holly found a real friend and i really like them hanging out lauren character is so funny and she is a natural talent i would like to see her more this show really takes you in and makes you laugh i wish the show hasn't been over
<START> i have seen a lot of <UNK> in the past but this is the most entertaining intense <UNK> and the most complete dvd i have ever seen the dvd extras are worth it because they it gives a different view of how the <UNK> act after the show such as the chris benoit interview edge interview some glimpse into the monday night wars era the first match of hogan winning tag title gold and some <UNK> talk additionally there is a good music video br br 1 tag team table match <UNK> ray and spike dudley vs eddie <UNK> and chris benoit 7 10 this was a pretty good intense match to start off the show not too many holds and just pure raw <UNK> spike can hold his own in tables matches and <UNK> and benoit gave good pure wrestling skills on the <UNK> br br 2 wwe <UNK> championship jamie noble w <UNK> v billy kidman 3 10 the crowd really didn't care about either wrestler and didn't get interested until kidman did a shooting star press usually people expect a lot of high flying in a <UNK> weight championship but this had very little in fact it was so bad that when noble hit his <UNK> no one even cared or knew you can tell by the lack of <UNK> flashing the ending was quick though br br 3 wwe european championship jeff hardy v william regal 5 10 i've never really liked regal as a wrestler he lacks intensity and style hardy was impressive but really didn't get a chance to show off his high flying act although he still performed some good <UNK> and added that needed fast pace to the match it ended off quickly which was perfect for this match br br 4 john cena v chris <UNK> 6 10 it's funny looking back at <UNK> very first <UNK> how he used to act how he used to dress and how he used to look watch his interview it's pretty funny this was a good intense match with cena showing a nice variety of holds <UNK> <UNK> and some <UNK> <UNK> was sub par but definitely helped cena launch his career cena wins br br 5 wwe <UNK> championship <UNK> v <UNK> <UNK> 8 10 this was a very intense and good match both <UNK> styles really matched up well on the screen with <UNK> pure power and raw energy vs <UNK> skill full moves and <UNK> <UNK> looked great in this match better than his later matches with edge and cena and the entire match was fast pace the ending worked perfectly because it still <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> streak while giving <UNK> his just <UNK> in his home state br br 6 no <UNK> match booker t v big show 7 10 another solid match that lacked a certain intensity as the <UNK> match but still a good follow up although it started off kinda slow which it always is with big show booker t was impressive and did a sick move on the <UNK> table the <UNK> was awesome the ending was a great upset and big move up for booker t br br 7 wwe tag team championship hogan and edge v christian and lance storm 5 10 this was a mediocre match hogan comes out like usual to a huge pop but his variety of moves lacks that intensity and energy then again christian doesn't exactly have the greatest athletic abilities himself this ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still ok for <UNK> br br 8 triple threat match for the <UNK> championship 10 10 rock v undertaker v kurt angle br br easily the match of the year this is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen it had close falls plenty of <UNK> stolen <UNK> raw energy intensity and fast pace no one could predict who would come out of this one if your going to buy this dvd i would buy it strictly for this match ending watch for yourself br br overall this was a solid <UNK> with plenty of extra <UNK> to keep you watching again and again although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd it is definitely worth your money
<START> like many here i grew up with scooby doo unlike many here who did i love this show i think that it has been very well done and thought through everything about it marks it as a spin off which isn't meant to be taken seriously the formula is simple it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy by using the well known shaggy and scooby doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode br br there have always been scooby doo spin offs which have annoyed fans the classic being the scooby shaggy <UNK> shorts from the 80's these spin offs had their place they allowed new content to be sold created new fans and kept scooby doo <UNK> on the shelves i would agree that shaggy scooby doo get a clue doesn't fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby shaggy <UNK> shorts to be an action packed show which focuses on the best funniest scooby doo characters good features of the show the animation the voices the attention to detail the bad guys the best friend relationship between shaggy and scooby doo the constant humour bad features none although the <UNK> mystery machine is pretty close at times br br well done warner bros animation one of the <UNK> cartoons in a long time
<START> the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival i thought it intriguing fascinating the sensitive <UNK> sexual artist so very european so very dutch i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that <UNK> theme of the mad writer with a religious sexual <UNK> <UNK> complex get a grip this guy is a <UNK> living off of society i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy nightmares about the <UNK> is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year's of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars and bed with strangers not only is he making outrageous sums of probably <UNK> <UNK> for making up stories lying guilt trip but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut hence he <UNK> the beauty <UNK> owner then he has the nerve to complain about the bill but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de <UNK> camera work and one of paul verhoeven's earlier films hmmm maybe the world hasn't changed so very much after all
<START> i really love this movie saw it again last week after 3 years or so this movie is perfect great acting great story great directing camera work music it is a gift to show it to someone you love too bad <UNK> van <UNK> did not make more movies after this one top 5 work really br br today it's 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines anyway i saw le <UNK> <UNK> again yesterday this is with no doubt in my movie top 3 together with cinema <UNK> which is also a masterpiece the soundtrack is also really good i am really curious about <UNK> von <UNK> new movie i hope it will complete my movie top 3 if you see this movie rent it or even better buy it because you will want to see it again
<START> this is listed as a documentary it's not it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an american pie style comedy it's not that either br br basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid throw is a couple of <UNK> also on the same sort of quest and you have a non hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls br br considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty br br if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour then this may be your thing if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this
<START> strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in <UNK> so i had to wait for the video release my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming along with <UNK> this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90 s br br people who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the <UNK> corny or braveheart acceptable will be <UNK> disappointed all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it 9 out of 10
<START> the sweet is never as sweet without the sour this quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion tom cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life he takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist this film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break br br its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it you cannot really appreciate the better things in life the sweet like love until you have experienced the bad the sour the theme will really get you to open your eyes br br only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand i think the end is perfect though i recommend you watch it and see for yourself
<START> steven <UNK> adaptation of alice <UNK> popular novel is not without its share of controversy when first released members of the black community <UNK> its treatment of black men while others <UNK> why a white man was directing this film about black women br br this is the story of a young black woman named <UNK> growing up in rural america after the turn of the century she has two children by her abusive father which are <UNK> from her arms at birth her only <UNK> in her miserable life comes from her sister br br <UNK> played in later years by newcomer <UNK> goldberg is married off to an abusive husband danny glover the husband is <UNK> by the sister and so she is quickly removed from <UNK> life br br the story is often heartbreaking as <UNK> keeps up hope that she may one day be reunited with her sister and with her children throughout her life she meets an assortment of characters including sophia a tough as nails wife to her step son and <UNK> a loud and <UNK> saloon singer who teaches her a thing or two about love br br <UNK> direction is all over this picture which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances i dare you to watch this film and not be moved the film the color purple manages to capture the essence of what is a complicated story while it tends to <UNK> the lesbian aspects as well as the african story both of which were so vivid in the book the movie remains true to its themes allowing the voice of alice walker to shine through br br i couldn't begin to respond to the controversy that surrounded this film suffice it to say however this is one of the few films that i can watch again and again and which has left an <UNK> mark on me br br
<START> cat soup at first seems to be a very random animated film the best way i've been able to explain it is that it's quite <UNK> though it's not totally random the story is about <UNK> a young cat boy and his sister <UNK> <UNK> is very ill and dies however <UNK> sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieve half of it the story is about their quest to bring <UNK> fully back to life br br though a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random it is not most of it is symbolism for life death and <UNK> you can also see references from other tales such as <UNK> and <UNK> this strangely cute short film has an interesting story packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen
<START> a poorly written script with no likeable characters as for it being a comedy i forgot to laugh it's about 2 <UNK> friends who <UNK> to get women in too bed with them no sex scenes and another friend who is semi <UNK> weird who sometimes also <UNK> but mainly is considered as being the guy who <UNK> the 3 friends <UNK> meet and fall for the same woman amanda <UNK> somehow this is done without really any romance the 3 guys stop being friends as they <UNK> dated her she <UNK> them out of their friendship because they <UNK> women a bad movie
<START> no spoilers just plot details i can't understand such hatred for this episode you want to watch a bad episode of <UNK> watch <UNK> now there's a sack of crap tom <UNK> gives a good performance i don't say that very often and michael <UNK> is great but he is most of the time the alternate universe scenario seems <UNK> realistic the martian <UNK> who previously appeared in static returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him an overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace
<START> let's set one thing straight this movie does not seek to <UNK> the genre it's not dr <UNK> o young frankenstein it's a silly flick with three great female leads can't remember any other comedy with similar characteristics rachel <UNK> and amy <UNK> from snl and indie queen parker posey charming as ever the story is basic the three <UNK> were losers in college and are still after <UNK> it <UNK> is a dog <UNK> who can't even get a date with a blind guy posey is an assistant for a senator who hasn't been touched by a man since <UNK> was in office i <UNK> that one several minutes later i'm a little slow ok and <UNK> has a gay fiancée seth meyers from snl funny they have to prevent the <UNK> daughter of the senator the always cute <UNK> <UNK> from the tv series joan of <UNK> to embarrass her during spring break so of course they have to go to watch over her and some hilarity ensues all in all a light simple comedy quite short and quite enjoyable
<START> ok this movie starts out like a cheesy lifetime movie and doesn't get better till almost well through the movie the script is full of <UNK> and <UNK> and cast is not well directed for the most part for the first half of the movie the little girl <UNK> on my nerves i do not think this is one of her best acting jobs the only reason i bought the movie is because it was on sale and had ellen <UNK> in it she's terrific but this is also not one of her best acting <UNK> the story is based on true events and that helps the movie actually i didn't even like the movie at first and was getting disgusted when i saw stills of the balloon traveling i mean let it get where it's suppose to go and be done with it but all is forgiven by the time it does reach it's destination and the story comes to a close if this doesn't bring a tear to your eye nothing will it's cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again
<START> this would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991 except it got beat out by the brilliant <UNK> this is such a wonderful movie i loved it i love stories where different characters' lives <UNK> with others and how deal with their lives kevin kline is good here but is <UNK> by danny glover and especially steve martin i've never much like martin or his style but here he is great i loved the whole speech he gave to kline near the end about the grand canyon the writing was excellent larry <UNK> is imo a great dialogue writer along the ways of kevin smith and quentin tarantino here he has formed several three dimensional characters and well thought out <UNK> and messages that give a positive feel to our lives a truly excellent film 4 out of 4 stars
<START> there are other reviews here so i don't need to say how great it is or what it's about my point is i heard about this movie ages ago before it was shown i can't even remember how i just know it was through the internet the <UNK> went under before it ever hit for months i <UNK> and complained please note that on this page there's a link to buy this film and the only <UNK> area is vhs at amazon com in germany you can use <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to translate i know it's pal format and they did change the text on the screen to german and there's a tiny little bit of narration at the beginning that's also been dubbed in german but as hilarious and campy as this film is it really only makes it funnier if you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does <UNK> it's so worth it it cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the u s from germany trust me it might seem like a lot to spend on a film but if you're into corny b flicks you'll be blowing money left and right getting <UNK> for your friends
<START> this movie is brilliant in every way it touches on the <UNK> of loving relationships in a meaningful way but never <UNK> the script never <UNK> toward any character not even the hapless johnny it also and benefits from spot on direction production design casting and performances the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike cher than she has ever been is a wonder to me i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end
<START> as a mother of 2 young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many <UNK> of scooby i feel well <UNK> to comment on the historical and current version of scooby br br if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight nothing special saturday morning cartoon but that in essence is the problem it is in it's current format so light weight that it will not have the <UNK> of the old scooby and gang i'm sure it may succeed in a quick <UNK> return but i'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost my 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any <UNK> said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn't it anything like the last series where are you br br <UNK> doo was an <UNK> but still infinitely better than this let's hope get a clue will be <UNK> with reference to the producers
<START> the worst thing about crush is not that it's acted pretty bad or that the plot is virtually non existent and it's not even that bad that the <UNK> could have been better br br no the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come br br but in the end it's too little too late if you are a fan of <UNK> music and cheap <UNK> scenes of 40 women crying and <UNK> and talking about babies and marriage then by all means don't miss it br br i myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie and as a result i had a pretty horrible time the few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it br br the verdict 4 10 guilty of wasting my time br br
<START> i was previously unaware that in the early 1990's <UNK> university or was it <UNK> tech added film to its wonderful <UNK> of technical degree programs well this movie must have been the product of the class <UNK> my friend and i rented the original 1980 boogeyman on my netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the dvd do not waste your time with this movie awful awful awful br br the filmmaker adds 2 main character's a woman and her <UNK> the woman has been having dreams about the boogeyman and his <UNK> from the first film over 50 of this film is stock from the original movie the rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her <UNK> <UNK> on a the narrator these scenes are shot through a <UNK> so thick the characters glow they would make angela lansbury look 25 years old so to <UNK> awful don't watch this movie
<START> i saw this at dances with films and it was awesome i really felt for jake talk about adding insult to injury not only are your parents getting divorced but there's a monster after you br br it was both heartfelt and scary there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film except that the story was actually good br br and that's what separated <UNK> closet from the usual <UNK> film <UNK> an excellent script with compelling characters also by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama the movie gets the best out of both genres and avoids the clichés of both br br if it's not coming out in theaters definitely get the dvd
<START> my brother and i have pokemon <UNK> on dvd we watched it like a couple of times and it was the best too bad it a new pokemon didn't talk this time i'll get used to it br br the iron masked <UNK> was pretty mean when he captured <UNK> with his dark ball good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his control br br there was only one song in the ending credits called <UNK> b r a t e performed by russell <UNK> br br pokemon <UNK> became a success since the three previous films and people will always love that film
<START> race car drivers say that 100 <UNK> seems fast till you've driven 150 and 150 <UNK> seems fast till you've driven 250 br br ok br br <UNK> dog seems <UNK> bizarre till you've seen <UNK> and <UNK> seems <UNK> bizarre till you've seen <UNK> br br and <UNK> seems <UNK> bizarre till you've seen the works of c <UNK> <UNK> race fans there is nothing in all the world of film like the works of c <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot and it only involves hippies rock <UNK> voodoo ghosts vampires robots <UNK> corrupt <UNK> <UNK> elephants and mystery gas and the fabulous <UNK> <UNK> the sunset district in san francisco of course br br what's really startling is that somebody gave him a lot of money to make <UNK> ghost there's sets lighting hundreds of extras costumes lots and lots of effects somehow that makes <UNK> ghost so wrong you watch some awful <UNK> like night of horror or <UNK> baby and at least some part of the weirdness is <UNK> on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the <UNK> on their discover cards but <UNK> ghost was made with an actual budget and that's evil i mean i've got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in thunder bay <UNK> building a secret temple in the woods out of <UNK> and <UNK> beating down my door waving a <UNK> how did this guy get the <UNK> for four of the <UNK> movies ever made
<START> this isn't the best romantic comedy ever made but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable it's directed in an old fashioned way and that works fine <UNK> shepherd as <UNK> isn't bad in her role as the woman who can't get over her husband's death she has a sexy maturity but i can't say much for ryan <UNK> as philip because he is at best <UNK> he may be adequate in the role but that's not good enough br br however i get the feeling that some of the characters particularly alex and miranda are not written with enough in depth thought we don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick and the writers don't tell us much beyond what happens but that problem was <UNK> because mary stuart masterson has a fresh as a daisy <UNK> to <UNK> it up and robert downey jr is so charming that he <UNK> the screen even his smile is <UNK> and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the <UNK> <UNK> and flashback scenes br br anyway this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way why not give it a try br br
<START> bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in <UNK> las vegas i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in <UNK> her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you the highlight of the show was her singing stay with me from her 1979 movie the rose you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having <UNK> <UNK> the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette <UNK> albums
<START> tourists head to ireland for a school trip to learn about <UNK> what they encounter is a horrific tale of <UNK> killers br br if i had to sum up evil breed it would be a low grade gore fest the film mixes dead alive evil dead wrong turn all in one it's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any fun one would have watching it the film has lots of random horror nudity although the film also stars four porn stars <UNK> four so there could have been plenty more breed also showcases a good amount of gore br br evil breed has a horrible start with laughable dialogue and horrible acting that's a given in a straight to video horror film but this takes the cake i can't really figure out who the main character is since the one female who lives at the end is not really in the movie all that much speaking of the ending that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film it has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one's view of the film br br you have to see this film to believe it since there are some pretty great death scenes there are two death scenes that come into my mind one in which the <UNK> killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest <UNK> her chest don't ask me the other id when the guy gets his intestines yet again ripped out through his <UNK> does that kill the guy no the killer continues to <UNK> the guy with his own intestines these scenes remind me so much of dead alive with the right amount of humour in each i also got the sense of evil dead with the pointless mentions of horror films and sam <UNK> along with halloween when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately y to get in br br although the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film when the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots distracting indeed as well as the continuity in the film with only one <UNK> killer as well as which character dies at which moment i couldn't tell if the breast <UNK> chick was jenny or <UNK> sister cousin i can't remember as well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body still attached with the <UNK> <UNK> br br the horrible editing is distracting as well the opening credits are too fast and <UNK> it did have a bad start and got better but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level if maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film then it wouldn't have been horribly butchered to death stay away from this film unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore
<START> <UNK> says <UNK> gentleman crime <UNK> philo vance william powell to the district attorney i'm coming more and more to the belief that archer <UNK> was killed in this room that poker this <UNK> <UNK> now these <UNK> it's all here but vance <UNK> says do you mean to tell me a dead man walked upstairs i'm not trying to tell you anything but the facts vance says this is the most remarkable case in my experience br br we're sympathetic wealthy arrogant archer <UNK> disliked it seems by all who knew him had been found <UNK> in a chair in his bedroom pistol in his hand and a <UNK> wound to his head but wait further examination shows <UNK> had been hit hard by a blunt <UNK> that <UNK> his skull then there's the <UNK> wound in his back <UNK> matters is that <UNK> bedroom door and windows all had been locked from the inside <UNK> was no suicide this was murder but how could the killer have escaped what was the specific motivation since there are so many suspects and why was <UNK> brother <UNK> <UNK> found dead in the main floor closet br br the <UNK> murder case now 73 years old still provides a stylish look at the old locked room classic <UNK> what makes it work as well as it does is first the mystery is complicated and clever but still is logical second is the amusing assured performance of william powell consider his work as philo vance as something as a rehearsal for his great performances as nick charles few things escape vance he uses his wits to piece things together he's also good company powell was a star in the <UNK> and moved <UNK> <UNK> in status and popularity when the <UNK> took over his intelligence style and <UNK> sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary seeming of actors from the past br br also pleasant is seeing a few other great faces there's mary <UNK> as <UNK> lake the young <UNK> and potentially rich ward of <UNK> paul <UNK> as a titled brit <UNK> around <UNK> helen <UNK> with her notably <UNK> and selfish manner watch her really do her stuff in <UNK> of 1938 <UNK> <UNK> a small elderly man as the <UNK> dr <UNK> whose job as <UNK> and medical <UNK> keeps taking him away from his <UNK> and ralph morgan as archer <UNK> private secretary this movie has a high <UNK> of middle aged men without an ounce of fat who can wear <UNK> english cut <UNK> suits with ease most of all is eugene palette with his noble belly and <UNK> voice as detective sergeant heath sergeant heath and vance are long time <UNK> who actually seem to like each other
<START> full house was and still is a great show it's a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really aren't any shows like it anymore the kids are very cute and even though it's a bit cheesy it's still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid i would love to see the cast interviewed now anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd should go to the <UNK> spot website and sign a <UNK> titled full house reunion on dvd as there is a <UNK> for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it <UNK> for full house
<START> what can i say oh yeah those freaking fingers are so weird they scare the heck out of me but it is such a funny film jim carrey works the grinch if you <UNK> already seen it then what you waiting for an <UNK> go go and get watch it you dont know what your missing
<START> this was a hit in the south by <UNK> <UNK> film festival in austin last year and features a fine cast headed up by e r 's gloria <UNK> and a scenery chewing john glover though shot on a small budget in nyc the film looks and sounds fabulous and takes us on a behind the scenes <UNK> through the rehearsal and <UNK> of what actors call the scottish play as a reference to the word <UNK> is thought to bring on the <UNK> ancient curse the acting company <UNK> all the emotions of the play itself lust jealousy rage suspicion and a bit of fun as well the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced in the lead role by a well known pretty face from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds the green eyed monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds nicely fine soundtrack and good performances all around the dvd includes director's commentary and some deleted scenes as well
<START> i went to see <UNK> as 2005 <UNK> festival <UNK> man that was one cool kick off the director was supposed to be in <UNK> for the canadian premiere but due to health reasons he's still in japan oh lord i hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies br br the plot is pretty simple but somewhat original the demons are <UNK> in <UNK> in japan and <UNK> called demon <UNK> are <UNK> them and <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> the demon <UNK> who's sleeping and supposedly is very kick ass br br it brings us to <UNK> some kind of elite <UNK> called demon <UNK> and his buddy <UNK> who's the typical violent jealous <UNK> br br seems boring well now it <UNK> br br <UNK> took his retirement from killing demons since he <UNK> a young kid on the impression that he was the demon he never knew but he did killed her so <UNK> went on with his life and recycled himself in <UNK> theater in a boat <UNK> on a nice night <UNK> spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and <UNK> to <UNK> demons for the good cause the cause of love and damn the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre br br <UNK> carries the movie as far as playing goes he is the total package he knows how to fight hell yeah he knows he's witty he's intelligent and he has that <UNK> you never have to yell no <UNK> it's a trap the guy already knows it he has that common sense he's really the perfect hero br br as far as cinematography goes the <UNK> are pretty interesting it's by far the movie that looks the most like a manga it's <UNK> full of special effects and nothing at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic it's pretty amazing lots of colours an unreal photography other than that it's pretty straightforward but like i said the main character is carrying the movie a must see a tale lead by masterful hands
<START> this show stinks for parents they usually want their kids to watch something good for them it is usually educational funny and bright br br is it educational no the <UNK> sing and that's it they usually sing about themselves they don't try teaching anything br br is it funny no the <UNK> instead say something which is not intended as a joke and laugh at it br br is it bright it's so bright it's painful as far as color s everything is extremely bright so that's good but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the <UNK> therefore they are always happy a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad br br the show is also extremely cheesy every <UNK> is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny it's <UNK> br br for kids it's entertaining but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it they'll never know how to grow up
<START> without a doubt this is one of the worst films i've ever wasted money on the plot is <UNK> sorry did i say there was a plot the scariest moment was when nope can't think of one the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was nope can't think of one for that either you knew who the killer was right from the start there was nothing scary about the whole movie in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister misty in the shower and when you saw nurse <UNK> take her top off this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie
<START> <UNK> is such a great movie from start to finish you cant take your eyes away i love all the clips of michael singing and dancing and i just love the <UNK> <UNK> bit <UNK> funny and the <UNK> <UNK> is to cool with all the special fx etc michael is a genius and always will be
<START> this final entry in george <UNK> star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot however this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series on the contrary sure it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow going at times but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission br br the first third of the movie where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of <UNK> the <UNK> is a classic <UNK> a truly disgusting blob of <UNK> flesh who speaks in his own language not only makes a great villain but a memorable one too it must have been a nightmare to <UNK> this giant puppet much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product actually what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of <UNK> court including the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and scary <UNK> pit monster it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while br br things get a little bit slower around the second act where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of <UNK> home of the <UNK> yet <UNK> ewoks most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i've read seem to be centered on these <UNK> creatures in that they somehow <UNK> the tone of the saga i don't totally agree with that although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should however their leader <UNK> played by <UNK> davis is a delightfully memorable creation and watching how they handle the <UNK> <UNK> technology with their simple natural weapons provides a nice contrast br br by the time we get to the third act though the pace picks up again as we <UNK> between the ewoks battle against the troops <UNK> and the rebel forces <UNK> an attack against the <UNK> all new half completed death star and <UNK> final showdown with darth vader and the emperor the latter ties with the <UNK> palace sequence as the highlight of the movie mark <UNK> <UNK> his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes and watching him as a fully <UNK> jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance also as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is he is <UNK> only by the <UNK> <UNK> like emperor played with deliciously <UNK> frightening evil by ian <UNK> the tension between this trio <UNK> the excitement of this climactic moment which is appropriately darkly lit and <UNK> <UNK> br br the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors the space battle fights are as <UNK> as always and the <UNK> bike chase through the forest is a <UNK> of course given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence the acting is classic star wars fare <UNK> harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and <UNK> into their roles and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c <UNK> frank <UNK> <UNK> only appears in two scenes but he makes the most of it and yes there's also john <UNK> music br br all told while return of the jedi <UNK> a little bit in the middle the first and third acts deliver in style making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest <UNK> ever br br in 1997 george lucas re released the classic star wars in <UNK> restored and <UNK> special <UNK> which featured added in effects and or shots as well as some <UNK> of the three return of the jedi appears to have caused the most <UNK> with star wars fans perhaps it can be due to the <UNK> out of place albeit funny if you're not so easily offended jedi rocks musical number in <UNK> palace which although technically amazing does <UNK> the flow of the film however i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory <UNK> occurring on the various planets of the galaxy this dvd version features yet more <UNK> we get to see more montage finale scenes notably on <UNK> where we hear what sounds like jar jar <UNK> screaming <UNK> free and in what is probably the most controversial change hayden christensen as the <UNK> of <UNK> skywalker in the closing scenes probably due to the intense and unfair disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii attack of the <UNK> it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone however if you're watching the star wars saga <UNK> and <UNK> about it chances are you may react a little differently nonetheless it is an issue that fans have raised so it's probably best to be warned beforehand br br as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films he nonetheless stands by what he said about these <UNK> being the definitive <UNK> of his classic trilogy and when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga as lucas intended it actually makes sense to keep them technically and <UNK> consistent the original films will always be <UNK> in our memories but these new <UNK> are just as much fun if one can give them a chance
<START> as a big time prince fan of the last three to four years i really can't believe i've only just got round to watching purple rain the brand new 2 disc <UNK> special edition led me to buy it wow i was really looking forward to watching it but i wasn't prepared for just how electric it actually is <UNK> musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding he really has the moves in this one i am very familiar from repeated <UNK> with the classic purple rain album and all its songs but to see them in the context of the movie completely <UNK> your perception of the tunes and lyrics like computer blue the beautiful ones when <UNK> cry and purple rain itself there is something <UNK> <UNK> about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform the closing songs baby i'm a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was <UNK> with in his mid <UNK> he's <UNK> it blew me away it even makes michael jackson seem <UNK> even in his peak years br br prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams drive her to a lake make her jump in then drive off absolutely hilarious stuff in <UNK> br br some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film's overall charm morris day is the coolest cat on the block and hilarious and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and <UNK> <UNK> light up the stage <UNK> <UNK> style i love their dancing in this bit and how <UNK> provides morris with a mirror mid performance br br i already can't wait to watch it again i really can't extras are terrific particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre beverly hills cop admit he is a prince <UNK>
<START> <UNK> miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand drawn animation as a form of storytelling yet often he is being compared to walt disney that is just so unfair because it becomes apparent by watching miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist he really has a gift of thrilling both <UNK> and children and laputa is indeed one awesome ride br br but where can i begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking miyazaki's works have never <UNK> to <UNK> me laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and i wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination ask yourself this question if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical what would it be like the answer would be to <UNK> yourself in some seat and watch laputa because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing from the train chase to the amazing air flying sequences and to the <UNK> sight of the floating castle itself not to mention the excellent score by joe <UNK> everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here
<START> the only other review of this movie as of this date really <UNK> the stars and the movie itself i usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie i don't know much about it's unfortunate when there aren't many comments for a certain <UNK> because when there is only one review and it <UNK> <UNK> the movie and cast you don't get an idea of what to expect i read the review before watching this title and i don't know where all the <UNK> for this movie and the stars came from douglas and blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered even when the material was not the greatest i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable it isn't one of the great all time classics but a pleasant and funny <UNK> much more than you can hope for in most newer movies if you are a fan of these stars you will not be disappointed
<START> i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i've seriously gotten more emotion out of <UNK> and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the <UNK> movies are crap and <UNK> acted so far the only interesting teen <UNK> movie i've seen was <UNK> so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity i really hope someone decides to either re make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential
<START> let's just say i had to suspend my disbelief less for <UNK> than i did for <UNK> that is to say i have less of a problem believing toby <UNK> can stick to buildings than i do <UNK> wood throwing down with <UNK> in <UNK> i won't get into <UNK> as i don't want to write a spoiler but the idea of grown professional british men getting into near death <UNK> every weekend is well funny and this film is not the fighting the idea of fighting is taken far too seriously the gravity of the <UNK> the <UNK> with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating as it neither <UNK> or <UNK> the conflict it seems as though the plot with holes big enough to drive a <UNK> truck through has been slapped together with a contrived fish out of water theme so that viewers can <UNK> into woods <UNK> eyes as he learns how to become a man ie hitting other young men of <UNK> football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can the characters are cartoonish especially the americans at <UNK> the character development and story line are <UNK> to the viewer throughout the picture unfortunately the absurdity of the film doesn't reach its height until nearly the end which by then you'll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back pick up the football factory or fight club instead of this corny and disappointing dud it doesn't waste time with empty melodrama the tired old <UNK> in king <UNK> court or <UNK> <UNK> of coming of age <UNK> t they're just pure dark and clever fun the way violence is supposed to be
<START> this show has all the typical characters in a comedy the good guy the idiot the <UNK> the rich girl but it's set on the 70's that's the only difference that it has with other tv comedies i don't know how you can like this show its humor is pathetic i mean the jokes are so direct a typical dialog is this <UNK> oh jackie i want to have sex with you audience laughs jackie <UNK> you're a <UNK> audience laughs <UNK> oh yes i am audience cheers and <UNK> this isn't funny i think that if it didn't have those laughs i don't know how you call that in english sorry you wouldn't laugh at all this isn't intelligent comedy this is an insult to the public i like most of the american comedies but this isn't good at all i would give it 4 out of 10 sorry for my poor english again
<START> lindsay anderson was very much a european film maker whereas the likes of david lean <UNK> scott and alan parker make spectacular movies involving <UNK> scope anderson s movie are more about social commentary and subtext so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience br br what you think of if comes down to what you think of british film makers i m very much of the view that cinema should be a <UNK> medium the best brit movie makes are those who try to <UNK> hollywood in my opinion if you want to send a message try <UNK> express and i find the movie dated pretentious and too set in the 1960s 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in france you can just imagine every single french <UNK> <UNK> this movie especially the climax french new wave film makers will also admire the abstract <UNK> of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it and many will dislike it intensely
<START> this movie is stuffed full of stock horror movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pre <UNK> murder a mad vaguely lesbian female scientist with an even <UNK> father who wears a mask because of his horrible <UNK> <UNK> spooky <UNK> werewolves male and female adultery <UNK> lovers <UNK> <UNK> the half man half plant victim of some <UNK> experiment grave robbing mind control <UNK> up bodies a car crash on a lonely road <UNK> knights in <UNK> the lot all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst <UNK> work ever done br br the script is incomprehensible even by badly dubbed spanish horror movie standards and some of the editing is just bizarre in one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed that is <UNK> i do not understand explain to me again how this is exposition scenes that <UNK> this movie there is a sudden hand held <UNK> of the girl's <UNK> as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad <UNK> <UNK> all your <UNK> belong mine speech though why they went to the bother i don't know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place even allowing for the atrocious pan and <UNK> of the print i saw br br the director was according to one interview with the star drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it it is an incoherent mess it's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film the mark of the wolf man made 4 years earlier featuring the same actor but playing the part with more <UNK> and with a different shirt and make up is there a word in spanish for continuity and more padding of another actor in the <UNK> get up <UNK> about in long shot br br the music is incredibly bad varying almost at random from full <UNK> creepy house music to <UNK> to the longest piano and <UNK> <UNK> ever recorded thinking about it it might not have been a <UNK> it might have been a solo the piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the <UNK> with the other br br this is one of the most <UNK> <UNK> state inducing bad movies of the year so far for me enjoy br br favourite line <UNK> this madness and <UNK> will turn against you how true br br favourite shot the lover discovering his girlfriend <UNK> dropping the candle in a cartoon like <UNK> of surprise rank amateur directing there
<START> gerard <UNK> is absolutely perfect in this movie funny tender brave and lover he gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece as much by the other actors gina <UNK> <UNK> as by the story or the rhythm never boring always creating new emotions for me the best french movie of all time
<START> baldwin has really <UNK> low to make such movies the script the music just about everything in this movie is a waste of time br br the sound fx do not sound real they stick out way too much technical <UNK> etc if they are trying to make a movie about things like this at least try to get real with it and drop those extra <UNK> and <UNK> because those <UNK> don't really make loud sounds like that natural sounds like footsteps and such are non existent which gives it a void like atmosphere br br directing seems to be ok for such a low budget film i sure hope it was a low budget production although it does seem fairly amateurish at times br br most characters seem empty and false they simply haven't casted this movie very well i'd imagine it would've been a better idea to make baldwin speak some spanish than to make spanish actors speak english when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used i mean could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak english with a bad accent it's should've a long ago buried corpse in movie production the production team ever heard of subtitles this movie again manages to depict european police as lazy and corrupt the societies as vulnerable and helpless i mean if the plot again goes like the <UNK> can't do jack so let's call one american to bring down this international <UNK> or whatever br br <UNK> pictures <UNK> on the same path as columbia before it just producing movies for the hell of it i'd imagine them to have some self respect also are <UNK> supposed to buy every dirty title just because <UNK> puts out something good a few times a year maybe they should've used the same team as who were making <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> say i do it's spoken in spanish and paz vega and <UNK> <UNK> do a decent job keeping the movie <UNK> looks and sounds much better come on <UNK> wake up produce less sell more
<START> this is the one movie to see if you are to <UNK> or are a married couple the movie <UNK> a couple in italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion infidelity <UNK> work and family br br the so called culture of death that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think br br a must see i hope it gets distributed as it should br br <UNK> on the cast and director br br two thumbs up and a 10 star <UNK> from me
