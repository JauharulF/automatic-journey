<START> please give this one a miss br br <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the cast rendered terrible performances the show is flat flat flat br br i don't know how michael madison could have allowed this one on his plate he almost seemed to know this wasn't going to work out and his performance was quite <UNK> so all you madison fans give this a miss
<START> this film requires a lot of patience because it focuses on mood and character development the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set in frances <UNK> the sandy dennis character apartment but the film builds to a disturbing climax br br the characters create an atmosphere <UNK> with sexual tension and psychological <UNK> it's very interesting that robert altman directed this considering the style and structure of his other films still the trademark altman audio style is evident here and there i think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by sandy dennis it's definitely one of her darker characters but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary michael burns does a good job as the mute young man regular altman player michael murphy has a small part the <UNK> moody set fits the content of the story very well in short this movie is a powerful study of loneliness sexual <UNK> and desperation be patient <UNK> up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script br br i praise robert altman this is one of his many films that deals with unconventional fascinating subject matter this film is disturbing but it's sincere and it's sure to <UNK> a strong emotional response from the viewer if you want to see an unusual film some might even say bizarre this is worth the time br br unfortunately it's very difficult to find in video stores you may have to buy it off the internet
<START> many animation buffs consider <UNK> <UNK> the great forgotten genius of one special branch of the art puppet animation which he invented almost single <UNK> and as it happened almost accidentally as a young man <UNK> was more interested in <UNK> than the cinema but his <UNK> attempt to film two <UNK> <UNK> fighting led to an unexpected breakthrough in film making when he realized he could <UNK> movement by <UNK> beetle <UNK> and <UNK> them one frame at a time this discovery led to the production of amazingly elaborate classic short the <UNK> revenge which he made in russia in <UNK> at a time when motion picture animation of all sorts was in its <UNK> br br the political <UNK> of the russian revolution caused <UNK> to move to paris where one of his first productions <UNK> was a dark political satire <UNK> known as <UNK> or the <UNK> who wanted a king a strain of black comedy can be found in almost all of films but here it is very dark indeed aimed more at grown ups who can appreciate the satirical aspects than children who would most likely find the climax <UNK> i'm middle aged and found it pretty <UNK> myself and indeed <UNK> of the film intended for english speaking viewers of the 1920s were given title cards filled with <UNK> and <UNK> in order to help <UNK> the sharp <UNK> of the finale br br our tale is set in a swamp the <UNK> <UNK> where the citizens are unhappy with their government and have called a special session to see what they can do to improve matters they decide to <UNK> <UNK> for a king the crowds are <UNK> animated in this opening sequence it couldn't have been easy to make so many frog puppets look alive simultaneously while <UNK> for his part is depicted as a <UNK> white <UNK> guy in the clouds who looks like he'd rather be taking a <UNK> when <UNK> sends them a tree like god who regards them the <UNK> decide that this is no improvement and demand a different king irritated <UNK> sends them a <UNK> br br delighted with this <UNK> looking new king who towers above them the <UNK> welcome him with a <UNK> of <UNK> dressed <UNK> the mayor steps forward to hand him the key to the <UNK> as <UNK> cameras record the event to everyone's horror the <UNK> promptly eats the mayor and then goes on a merry rampage <UNK> citizens at random a title card <UNK> reads news of the king's <UNK> throughout the kingdom when the now terrified <UNK> once more <UNK> <UNK> for help he loses his temper and <UNK> their community with lightning <UNK> the moral of our story delivered by a hapless frog just before he is eaten is let well enough alone br br considering the time period when this startling little film was made and considering the fact that it was made by a russian <UNK> at the height of that <UNK> country's civil war it would be easy to see this as a <UNK> about those events <UNK> may or may not have had <UNK> turmoil in mind when he made <UNK> but whatever <UNK> his choice of material the film stands as a <UNK> tale of universal <UNK> <UNK> could be the soviet union italy germany or japan in the 1930s or any country of any era that lets its guard down and is overwhelmed by <UNK> it's a fascinating film even a charming one in its macabre way but its message is no joke
<START> i generally love this type of movie however this time i found myself wanting to kick the screen since i can't do that i will just complain about it this was absolutely idiotic the things that happen with the dead kids are very cool but the alive people are absolute idiots i am a grown man pretty big and i can defend myself well however i would not do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie also the mother in this movie is reckless with her children to the point of neglect i wish i wasn't so angry about her and her actions because i would have otherwise enjoyed the flick what a number she was take my advise and fast forward through everything you see her do until the end also is anyone else getting sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark anymore one can hardly see what is being filmed as an audience we are <UNK> involved with the actions on the screen so then why the hell can't we have night vision

<START> hollywood had a long love affair with bogus <UNK> nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time the most memorable were the jon hall maria <UNK> films which have long since become camp this one is filled with dubbed songs <UNK> <UNK> and slapstick it's a truly crop of corn and pretty near <UNK> today it was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost <UNK> in this day and age <UNK> mainly of trick photography the only outstanding positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity sad to say of the many films made in this genre few of them come up to alexander <UNK> original thief of <UNK> almost any other <UNK> nights film is superior to this one though it's a loser
<START> this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped though i will <UNK> that the ideas behind batman forever were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director as it turned out this was not to be the case br br apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton and the conservative <UNK> of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series i fail to understand how batman returns can be considered at all disappointing br br true it is not quite the equal of the first film though it <UNK> all the minor <UNK> of style found in batman a weaker script that <UNK> the <UNK> between not just two but three characters invites <UNK> comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film yet for all this it remains a <UNK> dark film true to the way the batman was always meant to be and highly satisfying br br michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne with <UNK> max <UNK> christopher walken named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor his partner in crime <UNK> <UNK> the penguin danny <UNK> in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence <UNK> richard iii and <UNK> kyle the <UNK> michelle pfeiffer whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman the four principals turn in excellent performances especially walken and <UNK> while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities br br there are some intriguing concepts in this film about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain to the script in some places which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four <UNK> fight there simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on br br nevertheless this is a damn good film i highly recommend watching this in <UNK> with the first and then <UNK> for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton
<START> inspired by hitchcock's strangers on a train concept of two men <UNK> murders in exchange for getting rid of the two people messing up their lives throw <UNK> from the train is an original and very inventive comedy take on the idea it's a credit to danny <UNK> that he both wrote and starred in this minor comedy gem br br anne <UNK> is the mother who <UNK> the film's title and it's understandable why she gets under the skin of danny <UNK> with her sharp tongue and relentlessly putting him down for any minor <UNK> billy crystal is the writer who's wife has stolen his book idea and is now being <UNK> as a great new author even appearing on the oprah show to in <UNK> he should be enjoying thus <UNK> gets the idea of <UNK> murders to rid themselves of these <UNK> factors br br of course everything and anything can happen when writer carl <UNK> lets his imagination <UNK> with <UNK> ideas for how the plot develops and it's amusing all the way through providing plenty of laughs and chuckles along the way as well as a good deal of suspense br br for <UNK> of black comedy this one is guaranteed to please
<START> when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry it completely blew in my opinion i didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell let's see i'm watching all <UNK> movies now to see where it went wrong my guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to <UNK> the whole i am in a dream <UNK> i see weird stuff oh <UNK> what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mind <UNK> storyline those sequels don't even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw <UNK> you are pretty much screwed and dead the first 3 <UNK> to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle frank then because she had information about the this movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat <UNK> no i'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the <UNK> series now they are <UNK> 1 and i don't even think i will watch it oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed again
<START> oh dear oh dear it really gets on my nerves when a low budget pointless horror affair tries to look interesting in the credits by having a bunch of good names pop up in the cast only to involve each one in the smallest most pointless possible roles in this film we have richard lynch in one scene a <UNK> appearance from martin <UNK> a brief spot for <UNK> welles slightly more time on screen for john philip law and a little time for karen black this bunch of random cameos does not really add up to much though richard lynch and karen black do raise some of the few smiles of this film with their appearances and its quite painful really as none of the main cast are much good at all i couldn't help but think that if more scenes were filmed with any of the b movie veterans above the film would be a whole lot better but as it is there are just a few <UNK> glimpses of good entertainment without the film ever actually <UNK> much entertainment value of the main cast the only charismatic or likable performances in my opinion were steve as <UNK> and his girlfriend who i believe was played by <UNK> madison never heard of her before but she has some measure of screen presence and is a good <UNK> the plotting in this one is simple evil undead <UNK> goes after those who <UNK> to steal his gold and it should make for good slasher fun especially given that it is directed by john carl who has done special effects for many of these sort of films including having worked on all three of the major slasher <UNK> halloween elm street and friday 13th and such small gems as <UNK> unfortunately the film is sadly lacking in suspense <UNK> and satisfying gore there are one or two mildly gory moments but nothing worth the effort of watching the film i wouldn't say in fact aside from the above mentioned cameos this entire movie is really quite stale and turgid with characters that couldn't get <UNK> quick enough for my liking and an unfortunate lack of any real interest i didn't even find it fun in a laughable bad movie sense which is rare for me since i love a lot of pretty crummy films i'd say avoid
<START> i started watching this because i thought it was a really <UNK> porno as i kept watching the only thrill i got from this movie was finding out what the name of it was so i could look it up and rip on it i just finished it and have considered ending my life knowing that someone actually made this movie br br for the people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great acting my words of wisdom for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie you are probably wishing you had all that time back of your life that you wasted on making this movie br br there is no way that this is a serious movie there was an old guy that gets stabbed and it doesn't even hurt him at all and when everyone else gets stabbed they drop dead br br it was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80 year old man that wanted to put the parts into his body br br my favorite part was when the old man found the or however you spell it because that made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd br br what really blew my mind that they decided to throw in that random scene about the college girls going into the woods looking for fake <UNK> br br if you do attempt to see this movie you should probably fill up your <UNK> and drop your <UNK> in it and be ready to jump in br br this is a must see for anyone who believes there life could not get any worse because this will help you realize there are people out there the makers of this movie who are even more pathetic and are going no where in life
<START> a touching documentary that puts a human face on the tragedy of 9 11 by showing how one small community to honor two high school friends lost on that day the film <UNK> the lives of chris and tom through interviews with family and friends and snippets of old photos through their <UNK> we glimpse two lives <UNK> cut short the film also documents how through a series of <UNK> an inspirational <UNK> garden was brought forth through the efforts of many people both known and unknown to the two victims through the laughter and the tears and the sweat we see the power of hope and honor and love this films evokes many different emotions but the final feeling is one of admiration of the human spirit by tragedy
<START> let me first start out by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie it's unfortunate that imdb doesn't have <UNK> of a star i watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia and it was absolute garbage the plot was horrible the acting was horrible the movie was utterly boring looked like the shadow with alec baldwin the shadow is infinitely better than this as well the character eve was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional she didn't even grab my attention i didn't even know her name was eve don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut the twist if you can call it that was laughable and pathetic when it came the movie had done such a horrid job of building suspense or <UNK> to any character that i simply thought who gives a s the only thing that made me even lift an <UNK> about this movie was the fact the <UNK> teacher was <UNK> in terminator 2 also a movie that was light years ahead of this motion picture massacre anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless people's time it's no wonder no actor from this movie ever had a <UNK> career in summary this movie is so bad i feel dirty and need a shower worst movie in history <UNK> was better prom night the remake was better and dare i say it saw iv was better
<START> from 1996 first i watched this movie i feel never reach the end of my satisfaction i feel that i want to watch more and more until now my god i don't believe it was ten years ago and i can believe that i almost remember every word of the dialogues i love this movie and i love this novel absolutely perfection i love willem <UNK> he has a strange voice to spell the words black night and i always say it for many times never being bored i love the music of it's so much made me come into another world deep in my heart anyone can feel what i feel and anyone could make the movie like this i don't believe so thanks thanks
<START> ed <UNK> mitchell is a teenager who lives for his job at good <UNK> a small but friendly neighborhood <UNK> stand while his buddy <UNK> thompson also works there but lack <UNK> single minded devotion to his job he's there because he accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher mr <UNK> <UNK> and has to raise money to pay the <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> fast foot chain opens across the street it looks like good <UNK> is history until ed <UNK> a secret <UNK> that brings hundreds of new customers to their door however the <UNK> manager of <UNK> <UNK> kurt jan is determined to get his hands on the <UNK> and put good <UNK> out of business meanwhile ed and <UNK> must rescue <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the world's oldest fast food employee from the demented hills asylum and ed might just find love with <UNK> jackson if he could take his mind off the <UNK> long enough to pay attention to her good <UNK> is a comedy directed for kids decent story acting and overall a pretty harmless kids movie
<START> i was really <UNK> up to watch when two of best movie critics <UNK> this movie as a <UNK> but the movie turned out be disappointing br br you will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply can't ignore the flaws and the shortcomings br br 1 the missile scene was total stupidity br br 2 <UNK> <UNK> and govinda pair looked awful he's <UNK> and she's just 24 more than double of her age 3 <UNK> comedy is less of acting and more of overacting br br 4 songs are good but <UNK> the pace of the movie br br 5 some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny and 6 poor and flawed story br br however there are few <UNK> 1 govinda great individual performance br br 2 some scenes are actually quite funny br br 3 <UNK> looks and acting keeps on <UNK> with every film br br 4 <UNK> <UNK> don sequences though under <UNK> but hilarious br br so 4 good points 6 bad ones this one gets 4 10
<START> right so you have a <UNK> tons of water that seems to flow really really slowly and a small town that happens to be right underneath the path of destruction throw in a <UNK> <UNK> an apparently mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and his son and then to spice things up you add a weak plot and bad acting all in all when you have a look at this film from a paying customers point of view i would feel extremely <UNK> off if this was a pay per view film if you want a laugh then you really need to watch this film
<START> this film was one that i have waited to see for some time i was glad to find it has been everything anticipated the writing of this film has been so finely crafted and <UNK> far beyond what is seen by the audience i found it amusing that so many people watching will not read between some very important lines but indeed if not the movie will make sense in a different way and is very brilliant the film has many stories and characters woven together around this one character <UNK> a man whom has rose from the streets amidst many <UNK> and become a very powerful criminal after spending some time in prison <UNK> finds a <UNK> in the justice system and through a disturbing turn of events is released only to find everything is not at all what it seems <UNK> finds himself going up against the higher realm of society and political <UNK> in order to make clear how important a man's word is and stands for a war begins as the street is in arms against <UNK> of wealth and corrupt power br br a build up to explosive and powerful non stop twists and turns this film will leave you <UNK> i found the cast of this movie to be outstanding and is not a movie to be ignored excellent go rent it today
<START> this is one of my favourite disney films it has everything you could hope for in a disney animation cute animals great songs a nasty villain and lots of adventure the story begins in paris where <UNK> and her three <UNK> live with their mistress in a mansion life is perfect for them until the <UNK> butler edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats he realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune the cats will be out of the way an excellent often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970's a time when the disney studio made few animations which features songs such as the title number the <UNK> as well as wants to be a cat this will <UNK> viewers young and old with its enduring
<START> how managed to avoid attention remains a mystery a potent mix of comedy and crime this one takes chances where tarantino plays it safe with the hollywood formula the risks don't always pay off one character in one sequence comes off <UNK> silly and falls flat in the lead role thomas jane gives a wonderful and complex performance and two brief appearances by mickey rourke hint at the high potential of this much under and <UNK> used actor here's a director one should keep one's eye on
<START> eric ability to roll from character to character in this <UNK> man <UNK> <UNK> his true range as a character actor each persona has their own message to convey about truth society class drugs etc this is an absolute must have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting his performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments i have ever experienced as a viewing audience
<START> <UNK> poet dylan thomas <UNK> from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of <UNK> for some propaganda branch of government in <UNK> br br thomas is portrayed as a believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a <UNK> for <UNK> romance thomas writing and <UNK> his poetry in <UNK> domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat <UNK> towards the end <UNK> somewhat <UNK> on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran who had shot up his house and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with br br the real story of this film is the love of two women one <UNK> knightley whose first love was thomas matthew rhys the second <UNK> miller who is <UNK> wife at times it reminds of the singing detective as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity
<START> i'm not sure why this film is <UNK> so low on imdb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film this is the definition of being a horror film i consider myself to be a big horror fan and i must say that this house delivers the goods house of wax is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part the town is creepy and i'm just gonna stop there because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins trust me when i say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it it's wonderfully diabolical and inventive with it's killing scenes the story is interesting and the characters are <UNK> drawn with the actors giving them <UNK> of personality paris hilton included whom does quite well with her part the film lies a little on the shallow side but it's so much fun and who cares this movie should eat up the box office and all horror fans should have part in it go see house of wax the film that features skin being <UNK> super glued lips dead animal <UNK> hot wax <UNK> on a still living person a finger being cut off a <UNK> a pole through the head and much more i was lucky enough to witness this film at the <UNK> premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film and boy do they have something to be proud of house of wax is the scariest roller ride of the year 9 10
<START> i had read online reviews <UNK> this obscure outing as a combination of gory horror quirky black comedy and borderline art house the film has elements of all three to be sure but they are at the service of such a <UNK> silly premise the title immediately gives the game away  and amateurish production to boot  that its long term neglect due to a lack of proper distribution  basically until cult epics picked it up for dvd release a full 30 years after its <UNK>  was no great loss to cinema or even the genre s the bed was apparently created for the purpose of <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> with a woman anyway a dying man who had made use of the four poster and even painted it ends up trapped in the wall behind the <UNK> and provides <UNK> commentary to the <UNK> several people from teenagers on a <UNK> to gangsters in hiding supply fodder to the hungry bed latest on the menu are a trio of girls  one of whom however recalls its mistress of long ago and consequently the bed seemingly fears her seeing various objects  from <UNK> to pieces of fried chicken  and people getting <UNK> up the belly of the bed is depicted as a <UNK> of honey colored <UNK> makes the film mildly amusing at times especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their <UNK> <UNK> which he seems to take rather too easily in his <UNK> but also awfully that at even a brief <UNK> minutes the whole pointless exercise feels strained and downright desperate
<START> wicked little things was a really good movie i will say at some parts it seemed really unbelievable and others it seemed as if there just wasn't enough thought put into the actions of the characters but overall it was exciting and entertaining i don't understand why this movie's rating is so low nor do i not understand why all the <UNK> film's ratings are so low these are b movies people and nothing more they provide great entertainment and most of them don't have many flaws at all this is definitely worth a look because you won't be disappointed with the outcome wicked little things is one of the best 1st <UNK> <UNK> films and compared to a lot of other films in the series this is one of the best overall
<START> due to a very misleading advertising campaign i saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10 the trailers on tv portrayed the film as a comedy and i <UNK> my parents until they took me after seeing the movie i was blown away i had no idea what to think totally different than anything i had seen before leaving far to many questions for such a young mind needless to say i loved it this morning was the first time i'd watched in in probably 2 3 years and i still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade kevin spacey and jeff bridges are both in top form as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to <UNK> his mystery the supporting cast are near perfect as well each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way the open ending was handled very well giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end how this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's oscars is beyond me if you haven't seen this film run to wal mart right now the dvd is usually in the bargain bin pick it up br br 9 5 10
<START> the back of the dvd for this movie <UNK> is the quentin tarantino of christian films this isn't so much an insult to quentin as it is to christian films this film is poorly written <UNK> acted and edited with a <UNK> intensity the scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time <UNK> photography flashbacks fades to grey freeze frames to tell the time <UNK> in the story are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility the camera is <UNK> some nice <UNK> shots are cut with ridiculous montages that have no significance poor <UNK> and lighting leave the viewer wondering who is talking to who in many scenes oh and the audio is terrible the special effects were decent and thankfully limited but this is all just technical the movie fails to engage on an emotional level the dialogue is so fake sounding and the actors seem to have only read it a moment before the camera was rolling the story the things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them the characters are struggling to take hold of one <UNK> and the characters have to make a stance on christianity and faith in every single scene take a <UNK> from m night engaging christian films don't have to have the characters saying the name of jesus christ in every scene for the movie to be christian goodness please don't try to show this to your <UNK> friends with any expectations other than laughter
<START> tim robbins did a masterful job directing this film i say this because he avoided convention and cliché he also <UNK> superb performances from susan sarandon who won an oscar for her role and sean penn even more amazing robbins doesn't <UNK> he just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind this is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty one of the most controversial subjects of our time without being unfairly manipulated in either direction i can't recommend this film enough 9 10
<START> if you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it but if you like those kind of <UNK> movies which stick in your mind for a while until you get the details then you will love it now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way br br basically the plot is in a post apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his or their way for survival in this fight they lost the ability to speak i don't want to write more to not spoil the movie for you but trust me if you like sf authors like or or even some from orson scott card you will love this movie
<START> if you have never read the classic science fiction novel this mini series is based on it may actually be good unfortunately if you are a fan of the book you probably won't be able to watch more than the first hour or two all of the political intrigue has been taken out of the film the most important scenes from the book have been taken out characters motivations have been changed completely and words from the wrong characters mouths where in the novel paul was a teen age boy with incredible political skill and a great understanding of the way the world worked in this film he is hot headed and and frustrated avoid this movie at all costs
<START> if this is not heavily featured on every list of what not to watch it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence which as long as that remains so is the acceptable alternative i'm not kidding you this is a bad movie joseph <UNK> returns from the dead with various vague <UNK> supernatural powers the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new increasingly comical looking and ridiculous and never scary or creepy in general when this goes for the latter of those it winds up just being bizarre and attempts at the former just don't work period outfits and stereotypes <UNK> and he is portrayed by david keith whom i respect in well at least <UNK> doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent which could also have to do with script and often over the top performance a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch the editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is and what on earth was with the red <UNK> for the flashbacks cinematography oh dear framing coverage effective use of angle that one could be attributed some to editing too perhaps please guys stop me when i say something you've ever heard about the existence of as far as the technical side goes this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the <UNK> than film but why stop there the plot is just poor the basic <UNK> been done and it's been done so much better than this the crow would be one the way it's told is <UNK> and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks it still doesn't satisfy pacing is about non existent the lead is distinctly unlikeable and there's more personality in a <UNK> door not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden kelly and thomas ian nicholas what in the name of all that is good and just pun intended are you doing in this you were already funny before this on the drew carey show nicholas well i haven't seen you in anything <UNK> american pie but if nothing else you were funny later on and in those productions the amusement was intentional dialog is the less said the better language is <UNK> and tends to be stupid the violence is <UNK> done and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it <UNK> at it might have been the smarter <UNK> characters don't get me started why spend so much energy on portraying <UNK> at times utterly illogical events the more you think about this the worse it gets it's not even passable as a bad horror flick or a b movie it may very well pass through the rest of the <UNK> and go further still it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an <UNK> <UNK> machine i recommend this only to people who want to <UNK> how bad this is and don't say i didn't warn ya 1 10
<START> fairly appalling enterprise suggests <UNK> to be an <UNK> artist <UNK> drawn to the violent <UNK> he knows best but unable to resist vacuous <UNK> in banal fantasy the first story is a ham <UNK> meaningless <UNK> with a b movie sci fi premise the second achieves some <UNK> but only via the outrage inducing <UNK> of <UNK> visited on its central character the third and most <UNK> seems to <UNK> to being a <UNK> sequel to child's play the direction is consistently clueless all <UNK> sound and fury a slave to the extreme <UNK> of the environment <UNK> in an ill chosen music score and in <UNK> flashy acting this is sheer stupidity <UNK> as a <UNK> sensibility as <UNK> and hollow as the abstract images that link the three sections
<START> this is about one of the worst movies i'd ever seen it's not the worst though <UNK> the hands of fate holds that honor br br this movie has a lot of problems to begin this whole movie is a cheap rip off of the conan movies there's the babe in a skimpy dress wearing a the quiet asian warrior the cookie cutter bad guy the almost mindless and so on there's lots of continuity errors in this film some of the dumbest errors i've ever seen are in this film br br fortunately when i watched this film i seen the mst3k version joel and the make the film watchable otherwise i probably would've turned it off five minutes into the film
<START> this movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made it is a story told in a steady pace told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and <UNK> way the story itself is quite simple at a first glance as the title implies there is an <UNK> journey a motive repeated for thousands of years this motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time and beyond but also had rich <UNK> meaning the film is a <UNK> <UNK> of most exciting eternal questions it is not just an odyssey of a person it is an odyssey of our species the film is great by itself yet in my case the impression from it will always be <UNK> with that from the book i've read it at the age of 10 really not thinking about problems like <UNK> is the relationship between evolution of <UNK> and development of human but the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction br br the day i learned got only special effects oscar and was not even nominated for the best picture was the day when <UNK> completely became two words meaning nothing to me
<START> <UNK> sir as usual brings out another amazing story with such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion <UNK> sir as usual without much special effects and not much <UNK> shoots in fact this was the only movie where he went outside india ever that too just to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> class is written all over the movie and to add to it music which is just amazing is one of my most <UNK> songs ever <UNK> who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too starting from to to to guru <UNK> has showed to the world what a versatile actor <UNK> is has been really good too she has showed that she can act too in non glamorous and character roles in all an amazing movie sad that the <UNK> public could not appreciate this <UNK> movie and it bombed at the box office
<START> oh god it could be a very interesting film and in fact it is i would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote why i saw it in a theatre see this film on dvd or on tv the shooting is really really poor it keeps shaking all the time in a completely tasteless framing br br its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema you got quickly <UNK> and you have to make some huge effort not to <UNK> on your neighbor 's seat br br it's really a shame <UNK> the story is edited in a non linear way which is quite rare and a very good idea for a documentary br br watch this at home
<START> this documentary was boring and quite stupid br br i mean the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how <UNK> evolution works it is a theory and the name is just plain dumb reading a college <UNK> text book could have told the documentary maker what <UNK> really is <UNK> is a good theory but evil if it is done as politics br br also there was no real evidence in this documentary just <UNK> some people no expert <UNK> and shady leads br br the documentary was also boring i mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes and then it would have been lots better br br there are a lot better documentaries than this this was not worth watching you can get better information from <UNK> d don't waste your money and time

<START> little <UNK> needs to fly is another in the remarkable body of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> work that is without <UNK> having recently <UNK> it on dvd nearly a decade after its initial us release in 1997 it has lost none of its power and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as <UNK> own recent <UNK> man and errol <UNK> academy award winning the fog of war like the former it details in its far too brief <UNK> minutes the life of an interesting american like the latter it gives a <UNK> at a side of war that few see yes we see the violence and the <UNK> but as the fog of war brought us into the mind of one of last <UNK> foremost this film allows us a <UNK> at the life of a <UNK> who is captured by the enemy tortured and ultimately <UNK> except in no way shape nor form is the film as simplistic nor upbeat as my brief description of it nor is little <UNK> needs to <UNK> titular subject <UNK> and immigrant german who survived the of the nazis we find out as example that in his hometown in the black forest his grandfather was the only man not to vote for hitler and suffered brutally for that stand post world war two germany and his own <UNK> at the hands of the <UNK> when his air force jet was shot down over on <UNK> 1st while the title of the film and the idea of passion for becoming a pilot <UNK> by the impression allied fighter planes made on him when they <UNK> his town as a child make one believe that is the central subject of the film this is not true the subject is survival or more precisely his human will all human will the details of romantic life are too hollywood and <UNK> an aspect to interest <UNK> nor is the fact that he won a purple heart <UNK> of honor the d f c and the navy cross that thing which pushed to survive so much and remain such a relatively upbeat man although there are glimpses of darker sides is what is at the center of this film and all of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of his past is fully <UNK> <UNK> country and the use of a <UNK> e during many jungle scenes among other excellent touches in the score show <UNK> is perhaps along with only martin scorsese the best <UNK> of image and music in film long may he <UNK>
<START> having been a godzilla fan for many years gamera was to me a cheap <UNK> to capitalize on the success of <UNK> 1 <UNK> star attack of the monsters was for me at the time 1975 an almost painful viewing experience br br last weekend i attended the <UNK> godzilla fest known as g fest where carl craig one of the stars of gamera vs made an appearance of course they featured this movie it was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made of course you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it in one scene for example the boy <UNK> held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the not too bright aliens when they realize they <UNK> been <UNK> one of them says that's funny i think those kids <UNK> to us not even plan nine from outer space can <UNK> that kind of dialog br br this may not be godzilla or even gamera 3 but this one is a decent enough time <UNK> if you watch it in the right frame of mind br br however if you want top quality <UNK> entertainment check out the recently released gamera 3 br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> i saw this 1997 movie because i am a fan of <UNK> lamas and of his father the late <UNK> lamas in my opinion <UNK> looked his best in this film mostly due to his <UNK> and the <UNK> wardrobe that were <UNK> to him br br as the plot progressed i realized the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor the story was about a ring of serial killers and the attempts of law <UNK> to investigate the ring and bring the members to justice there was adequate suspense and i believe the violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer br br at the end of the film i was shocked to learn the film is the true account of horrendous murders that occurred in <UNK> furthermore <UNK> and his leading lady were portraying actual fbi agents who solved the <UNK> of many young women and contributed to the <UNK> of the ring i believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and <UNK> of the criminal element

<START> on halloween a town is <UNK> by a lunatic with a big <UNK> for a head bad acting <UNK> mostly of local talent and laughable special effects makes this one <UNK> b movie queen <UNK> <UNK> looks embarrassed to be a part of this one and even her considerable charm which has helped so many of her other films can't help this one pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good halloween horror film and rent night of the demons which also stars ms <UNK>
<START> house of the damned also known as <UNK> is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects it is about a family that <UNK> an old irish mansion and after moving in begin to experience strange phenomenon and ghostly <UNK> including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and buried within a wall in the <UNK> basement the <UNK> young daughter is then <UNK> away into some other dimension and they seek help from a group of <UNK> <UNK> for help br br the ideas this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film <UNK> are obvious i will say that this movie does have some slightly creepy sequences but it is sometimes very very boring the acting here is nothing special the mood is alright the score which was mostly this dramatic irish opera music was somewhat annoying and the cgi special effects are really horrible i mean it was 1996 you would think they could have done a little better than they did the ending where the house was on fire was the <UNK> special effect i've seen very very cheap but hey this was a cheap movie br br also the <UNK> monster wolf thing that their daughter sees looks horribly fake and what was it's significance in the film anyway what the heck does a wolf monster have to do with a haunted house the special effects in here are what really ruined this movie the acting was pretty bad too i usually enjoy many low budget horror films but not this one house of the damned is nothing special at all only consider watching it if you have nothing better to do but you'll probably want to pass on it 4 10
<START> early <UNK> feature based on a popular stage play a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a <UNK> to see who the murderer is while the lights are out there's another murder so it's someone in that room br br what follows is an obvious dull and <UNK> murder mystery most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree they act like they're on stage where you have to <UNK> things and it looks silly on screen most embarrassing is bela lugosi two years before dracula who really <UNK> it as a police inspector static direction by <UNK> <UNK> who was always overrated doesn't help br br for <UNK> and lugosi <UNK> only i give it a 3
<START> i can't understand why imdb users would rate this movie 5 2 10 it really is great very funny i would strongly recommend this movie for all of you adults teenagers and especially children br br the story is about a 14 year old kid who always tell lie at home and school one day he had his <UNK> of writing a 1000 word story but he didn't so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours or he would have to go to summer school yep he wrote it in 2 45 big fat liar i think it was a story of himself on the way to the school he hit a <UNK> of a famous hollywood producer and he gave him a ride but the kid forgot the story in the <UNK> he told his parents and the teacher but of course they did not believe him and the movie producer he took the kid's story as his new movie big fat liar when the kid saw the trailer of the movie he told his parents he had written it but they didn't believe so he and his friend had to go to l a to prove one thing the truth is never overrated br br enjoy this great movie you won't be disappointed don't trust the 5 2 10 rate it should be 9 10 believe me br br p s so sorry my english isn't good enough to make a better comment
<START> first of i should point out that i used to love <UNK> the <UNK> as a child and i really enjoyed the movie even though i am in my <UNK> br br but this movie was so bad i was ashamed to have been a fan in my youth br br ok ok i know this is a movie for kids and isn't aimed at people like me anyway but this is my thoughts on the movie for other people of my age br br the main downfall in this film is the itself it has to be the most annoying character i have seen in a child's movie possibly even more annoying then the young child in monsters inc it has the most annoying voice and <UNK> around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments i know <UNK> movies aren't exactly high brow but this was insulting to even a 2 year <UNK> intelligence br br secondly where was the story previous <UNK> <UNK> had a least a point to the story yes i can see this was about accepting people who are different to you into your hearts but really it ended and i felt like i had watched a 5 minute cartoon on kids tv br br i don't have children of my own but when i do i fully intend to show them quality children's movies like the movie toy story and finding <UNK> even though they are too childish for me these days i can see how they would be of great appeal to young children not so with this appalling attempt at a movie br br oh and one more thing not enough <UNK> he should have his own movie
<START> i just read an extra long review on the front page of this movie on this site and he explained in full detail that this movie is only worth watching on the television show mystery science theater 3000 and yes i do find that advice really helpful i mean a movie that tries to be this good and this exciting just really is not what that movie wants to be so yes do watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars you can give this a ten out of ten stars until then my one star review is for the real pure <UNK> version of this movie only got that now
<START> i had always wanted to see this film and the first three <UNK> proved i hadn't waited in vain but what the hell happened in the end i mean don't get me wrong i liked the film it definitely made me nostalgic of the realistic unique nyc of the 80s that we have lost thanks to <UNK> but it's missing another half hour
<START> henry thomas and robin are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business it's beyond me as to why they haven't received more recognition than they have this movie is a perfect example of how <UNK> their abilities are br br acting out the lives of folks who could be referred to as a bit odd seems to be their <UNK> and if these characters ain't odd i'm at a loss to find anyone who is br br the story is funny romantic dramatic complicated and tragic i hated the ending but if i hadn't i wouldn't have loved the story as a whole so there ya go
<START> it plays like your usual teenage audience t a movie but the sentiment is incredibly bleak if it was made today it'd be considered an art house movie it goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying br br the whole teen flick formula is <UNK> to but nothing turns out the way you'd expect imagine a director's cut of <UNK> a wonderful <UNK> where at the end james stewart wasn't allowed to return to the real world an incredible film that <UNK> all of the expectations of the genre it makes you feel dirty afterwards there is no redemption for the characters i'm amazed it ever got made the eighties version of detective story
<START> this is a special film if you know the context antonioni in his eighties had been crippled by a stroke mute and half <UNK> his friends who incidentally are the best the film world has arranged for him to a last significant film the idea is that he can <UNK> a story into being by just looking at it so we have a film about a director who <UNK> stories by simple observation and the matter of the four stories is about how the visual imagination <UNK> love br br the film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination the result is pure movie world every person except the director is lovely in aspect or movement some of these women are and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter there is no nuance no hint that anything exists but what we see no desire is at work other than what we create br br i know of no other film that so successfully <UNK> our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see he understands something about not touching no one understands van <UNK> visually like he does <UNK> <UNK> space music is <UNK> on precisely the same notion the sensual touch that implies but doesn't physically touch br br <UNK> <UNK> wife appears appropriately as the <UNK> and she also directs a lackluster <UNK> <UNK> film that is on the dvd br br ted's <UNK> 3 of 4 worth watching
<START> i was very disappointed when this show was canceled although i can not vote i live on the island of i sat down to see the show on <UNK> and was very surprised that it didn't aired the next day i read on the internet that it was canceled br br it's true not every one was as much talented as the other but there were very talented people singing br br i find it very sad for them br br that they worked so hard and there dreams came <UNK> down br br its a pity br br
<START> if you loved the 1993 erotic sci fiction cyborg film nemesis then you'll love this one i loved it the minute the elvis hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot out like nemesis its takes place in a post apocalyptic <UNK> of the future both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the <UNK> masses but thats where the similarities ends the ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses <UNK> on the drugs he sells them the rebels aided by <UNK> and a cyborg try to <UNK> his <UNK> hold on his subjects after several failed attempts to <UNK> the rebels back he sends his top cop to <UNK> the rebels this movie follows the track of most action adventure but isn't afraid to color outside the line
<START> in chicago four <UNK> <UNK> by dean richard <UNK> come to an old building to <UNK> power they accidentally <UNK> a <UNK> and arrive in another dimension where chicago was destroyed by a spider queen and inhabited by mutants the group meets survivors <UNK> by <UNK> david and <UNK> kate <UNK> and finds the <UNK> of the <UNK> dr richard colin fox who has been living in this dimension for thirty years they join forces trying to <UNK> a <UNK> to bring them back home <UNK> is a watchable of <UNK> only worse most of the dialogs seem to be written by a person who has not <UNK> the <UNK> school so <UNK> they are further the story is illogical and seems that chicago is the only city in the world the scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken <UNK> as if he were stealing a car is very funny the face of richard <UNK> looks like a white version of michael jackson and is horrible if the viewer <UNK> down his or her brain he or she may like this forgettable tv movie my vote is four br br title brazil <UNK> do terror in the web of horror
<START> oh how awfully this movie is i don't know if it is a horror film or a drama cause the story and the both genres are not established very well the story is not moving it is slow boring and sleepy from the beginning to end this movie really <UNK> me but i really liked the camera work it is authentic fresh and clear the acting is great too the little boy was the great performer in this movie but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat but this movie makes me grab a <UNK> lay on the bed and sleep until the credits roll br br boring not worth watching i tell you this movie sucked br br 1 10
<START> i really liked the movie 'the new <UNK> but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having relations with a <UNK> seriously this movie was bad it's like club dread after super troopers i am supposed to write 10 lines but i don't even know what else to say i laughed a couple of times but only because i was drinking a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk it was not maybe are just funny and regular cartoon people aren't either way just stick with the new groove if you want a funny cartoon <UNK> themed movie line 10 is this line right here
<START> the monster will look very familiar to you so will the rest of the film if you've seen a half dozen of these teenagers trapped in the woods movies okay so they're not teenagers this time but they may as well be three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly abandoned ghost town in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a <UNK> century and a half before you'd think that with a title like <UNK> massacre some interesting things might happen they don't in fact only about 1 10 of the film actually takes place in the mine i had <UNK> teams of terrified <UNK> <UNK> for their lives in the <UNK> confines of their <UNK> praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim <UNK> <UNK> his grisly revenge but instead i got <UNK> twenty somethings <UNK> and in one case <UNK> in the woods a gang of morons with a collective i q that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker <UNK> much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine no suspense no scares and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity
<START> just can't watch this bit too many times it's full of true enthusiasm and <UNK> mickey mouse had in his first 30 years mickey is an smart ass little <UNK> when compared this <UNK> willie always makes me smile at least the ending where mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a <UNK> animation is very nice and although <UNK> willie has no dialog the music is enough for it br br imho if this bit doesn't deserve 10 10 then any cartoon doesn't not only because it's a true classic but also because it's so full of joy and it's always fun to watch
<START> really here the french cinema hits rock bottom and compared to it the least appealing of the american adolescent horror movies the likes of friday the <UNK> freddy and co are masterpieces of the seventh art br br it's all the more <UNK> as there were exciting original elements the de and its legends the <UNK> and king arthur all were splendid <UNK> for a <UNK> fantasy and horror film alas filmed as an user <UNK> pointed out in a fake forest near paris the movie is fake horror fake <UNK> history fake <UNK> you should see the professor who was a wonderful m le in la <UNK> <UNK> un long scream for the <UNK> <UNK> which the production probably bought in a dime store fake characters fake <UNK> br br the boys disguised as <UNK> are unintentionally very funny so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts and what can we say of the <UNK> of the monster a ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce to think that people can spend money for such drivel when artists are still waiting for a producer br br word to the wise maurice wrote a marvelous story dealing with <UNK> and old <UNK> in his <UNK> saga called <UNK> a miniseries was made 30 years ago avoid this garbage and try to see it instead
<START> i'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie even my 4 and 6 year old were bored the <UNK> are cute but the storyline is overly obvious not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes br br we did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in <UNK> but i wondered why br br i don't admit to ever being a fan but i expected to be entertained it's not even an movie as far as i can tell simply a heavy handed view of too young we've seen more than enough of that with britney spears et al haven't we br br don't bother
<START> wow it's been a long time since i've last seen such a hilarious movie like this one i've never been a great fanatic about french movies but ever since i fell in love with the beauty and the acting skills of catherine <UNK> i decided to see all of her movies however i didn't think this one would be so fantastic as it turned out to be lucky me that i bought it even though i had some doubts this is really feel good time film with class and quality there are some great social topics and moral <UNK> involved that are very close to today's modern way of living which are shown very beautiful and realistic i also liked the dancing scene in the men's room a lot but my favourite is the rather <UNK> attempt of catherine <UNK> to sing she brings it the way she is with lots of grace and modesty at the same time very <UNK> further on i would also like to express my respect and admiration for line who played a fantastic role i didn't even know she acted i've only known her for her music so don't wait any longer and go see the movie you'll be surprised in many ways
<START> this movie made me think of how i could write something about it without personally <UNK> the director and all the actors who as an australian i am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film br br but the movie itself let me tell you a story br br found this dvd in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague <UNK> of the reviews at the time of cinema release here so i thought i would give it a go br br for some reason i decided to watch the <UNK> <UNK> before i watched the actual movie not something that i usually do turned the <UNK> <UNK> off halfway through as i'd had enough cringing at the <UNK> we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw <UNK> attitude br br the movie ugh full of clichés and pathetic character development the actors well done guys you are <UNK> and i applaud you and just like a team is only as good as the coach that directs them you unfortunately did not have a great script to work with br br i felt that the movie actually so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover i have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap agreed br br finally and forgive me if i don't phrase this correctly i was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all yes we all know that life is full of hard stuff and yes we know that things such as incest do occur but i really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it i believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there somewhere otherwise the movie is all about them and their feelings they have created it for themselves not for an audience br br which i think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great the special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a <UNK> hour sitting the day after he himself tried to end his own life well it may have been <UNK> for him to do this however the movie <UNK> of self <UNK> when you know the story behind why it was written i feel horrid i'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid note i have read the interview with andrew urban and understand why needed to write something to help him through his own issues but i believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs and i feel that this is what has unintentionally happened here br br by his own admission the director had no technical experience at all and sadly this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project br br as for any <UNK> that this movie should be studied at school or that all teenagers should watch it not sure there either because there is a very dangerous line at the end i too have been in a place where i have thought that someone who no longer has to <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> but as an adult i do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind might be in there to promote discussion but again it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole in fact it almost <UNK> that there is more sadness to come br br i haven't seen elephant but i just might go find it given all the comparisons here br br nothing personal here guys i do hope you can make another movie someday and we all have to start out somewhere so forgive me if i've been too harsh i am glad that you are proud of what you created which in the end is what life is all about it's not a movie i would recommend though br br oh i did like the way the time frames often <UNK> thought that was an interesting way to film br br but the whole its the quiet ones you have to watch we already know that
<START> my father the hero is sweet funny and cute gerard is awesome as andre a divorced father who takes his <UNK> year old daughter nicole <UNK> to the <UNK> for vacation while there his daughter meets a guy named ben dalton james to impress him she tells him that andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran off with her <UNK> everyone on the island is soon under the impression that <UNK> a child <UNK> andre is between two relationships one with isabelle emma thompson who makes a cameo in the end of the film and diana faith prince from spin city my father the hero has many funny moments like when he's at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french so he plays thank heaven for little girls from <UNK> everyone gets disgusted and leaves my father the hero doesn't deserve a 5 1 i think it deserves a 9 0
<START> from the first to the last scene of the movie director visconti excels at his art to the extent that the movie is <UNK> to remain as a cultural treasure for only god knows how long it is perfection as a movie that is but the story has some minor shortcomings br br thomas <UNK> novel is also a perfect piece of art so of course it is impossible to bring into another media visconti follows the story pretty much and it is only when he allows himself to <UNK> slightly that the transition <UNK> and no matter how wonderful the scenery is the tension in the air between the characters the hundreds of subtle <UNK> and <UNK> the almost <UNK> <UNK> serving of music still the minute <UNK> in the plot <UNK> me br br maybe i'm just a victim of man's desire to flaw the flawless nevertheless i will offer one example which i regard as crucial br br warning spoilers br br in <UNK> story eats the <UNK> which probably contain the disease that will kill him after giving up his frustrated chase of the boy in <UNK> unable to catch one delight he <UNK> for another which <UNK> him it is very subtle in the book but it is there the forbidden fruit of sorts but more a sign of him <UNK> life itself br br in <UNK> film he also eats <UNK> but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach the chase in <UNK> ends in a much more melodramatic way it works too but lacks some subtlety indeed and also the multi layered symbolism giving food for thought br br but that's all forgiven when the film allows us to feast on beautiful <UNK> faces and <UNK> and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly <UNK> the last gesture of standing in the water being the equally sublime and mysterious finale
<START> this movie may <UNK> appear to be <UNK> and for <UNK> <UNK> it seems to be the stereotypical high school movie but in fact it takes an honest and touching look at the high school experience it doesn't <UNK> some unrealistic ending where the <UNK> and the popular kids <UNK> it doesn't change what happened in <UNK> it just attempts to <UNK> with it this is a really great fun heart warming movie good for teens and for those who can still remember being one
<START> wow i loved this movie this film was filled with plot twists good acting great story and a surprising ending to be completely honest this movie wasn't overly gory it does contain some gore though but was more on the psychological side i read it on the internet the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days amazing this is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making what starts out as a <UNK> thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted even a bit more sinister not much i can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations
<START> this film got less attention than league of their own possibly because it has only one name star but whereas women's professional baseball had only an eight year <UNK> town existence japanese baseball is a vastly bigger <UNK> both in financial and popular support that alone would make it the better movie br br mr baseball shows the facts of life of japan ball the <UNK> cheering the <UNK> to the pressure of corporate owners on <UNK> the extreme <UNK> of play and no hot dog players welcome br br it also touches upon the isolation that any <UNK> but especially an american jock not the people most <UNK> in foreign cultures feels living in <UNK> <UNK> and the japanese for their part are not comfortable around <UNK> and let it show in various ways the <UNK> strike zone one american player complains bigger than a <UNK> br br the script may not have won any awards playing once again on the redemption by improved play theme but i found it considerably more enjoyable to watch than the <UNK> league definitely recommended for those who want to see another angle on this great sport
<START> alice is the kind of movie they made in the 30's and 40's never attempts to be an event just wants to entertain and it does i was surprised by <UNK> sutherland in a role that could be a cliche he made it real the plot does make <UNK> to alice in wonderland a guy dressed in white does go through a hole and <UNK> does fall down one like alice the plot does twist and turn but with a <UNK> you don't see in small movies i loved the direction sutherland just a very fast paced and interesting movie
<START> this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the vcr or dvd player michael <UNK> and lisa howard are two bounty hunters in love yet they are total <UNK> she is ambitious and organized while he is laid back and totally <UNK> <UNK> br br in this movie bad guys are chasing jersey character this opens the door to bad godfather impressions ludicrous fight scenes and tony curtis playing the most <UNK> looking mob boss i have ever seen the ending has to be the most unbelievable scene i have seen in a movie in quite some time i would believe the terminator even the matrix has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending this movie just <UNK> of <UNK> the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous yet the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and let loose on on unsuspecting public i watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over
<START> this movie was ok as far as movies go it could have been made as a <UNK> into <UNK> movies however it had little to do with the left behind books that it was supposedly based on major story premises were removed and new major story premises were added br br what disappointed me most was how <UNK> was portrayed he was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at this point in the books <UNK> is not satan is not <UNK> and not <UNK> br br faith and beliefs were portrayed in weird surreal ways that seemed to make the movie just silly br br non <UNK> who watch this will have more <UNK> to mock christian beliefs
<START> the adventures of <UNK> has to be one of the <UNK> excuses for a movie i've yet run across you would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of <UNK> on display in this movie acting  bad editing  bad direction  bad special effects  bad and laughable plot  bad lighting  bad cinematography  bad costume design  bad and silly everything else  bad watching the adventures of <UNK> is about as enjoyable as a root <UNK> even for a fan of bad movies it's a real <UNK> test this is one for either <UNK> or lou <UNK> <UNK> if any exist br br eight things i learned from watching the adventures of <UNK> br br 1 if you don't have the budget for real special effects <UNK> a scene from the previous movie it will look great trust me br br 2 when on a quest to recover take time for frequent stops to oil up you body it worked for <UNK> and his two amazon companions br br 3 any sword fight use of magic and just about all other day to day activities in ancient <UNK> created a sound very similar to a game of man or <UNK> br br 4 some of the ancient greek gods dressed like extras from star wars br br 5 if you need to pad your crappy movie's runtime <UNK> the title sequence by adding star trek style credits and throw in some overly <UNK> music it also helps if you've got a previous movie to pull scenes from br br 6 fight scenes move along much <UNK> if the bad guys attack <UNK> one at a time br br 7 william <UNK> did anything for money br br 8 i didn't think it was possible but the adventures of <UNK> makes the first film <UNK> 1983 look like an academy award winner
<START> i wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before i gave up the main character is completely clueless and <UNK> unsympathetic but there is no humor in his <UNK> as soon as he arrives in germany the screenwriter pulls the old there's only one room in the hotel you'll have to share a room with a pretty girl stunt come on at least you could let them develop their relationship a bit first watch it happened one night to see how to do it right or any of a thousand movies since then br br the acting is consistently third rate and the improvised dialogue should have been left on the cutting room floor it <UNK> with no plan at all despite the fact that the film <UNK> the <UNK> destination from the moment greta is introduced br br the first song in the <UNK> is mildly funny but badly sung the rest of the songs well to be fair i only heard those in the first half hour are just pointless and awful most of the singers are painfully out of tune but not in any intentionally humorous sort of way
<START> there have been very few great comedy films in the history of hindi cinema happens to be one of them the film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men <UNK> and salman who dream of becoming rich by marrying a <UNK> daughter <UNK> <UNK> and salman khan try their best to <UNK> each other and woo <UNK> the plot <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> co plan to take over all the wealth the movie is well paced and very funny rarely does one come across a hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent this is one of the few films with <UNK> and salman together probably the only film unfortunately it did not succeed at the box office and we might never see a film of this <UNK> again <UNK> khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his <UNK> as an actor in this film salman khan gives a very good performance as a dim wit <UNK> plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl and <UNK> who is assistant friend is also funny <UNK> <UNK> junior <UNK> kapoor <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> just add to the <UNK> of the film all in all the best hindi comedy ever made and i wish they make more quality films like this one you will want to watch this film time and again br br p s for those of you who have watched this film i also suggest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> old and new etc
<START> there seems to be a spectrum of cinema on the left there are movies made mostly for entertainment and or commercial purposes in the middle there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic on the right are movies that are not as commercial but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product br br i'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other but that when a movie goes too far to either end it's rarely good such is the case with <UNK> br br i had no idea what to expect when i saw it advertised a few friends were going and asked if i wanted to come along none of us knew what to expect and by the end none of us were pleased br br yes there are breathtaking images yes i'm amazed at the <UNK> the filmmakers went to in searching through <UNK> footage yes the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to and probably the best part of the experience the thing is this goes so far to the right side of the spectrum i mentioned that i can't say anything nice about the movie as a whole br br it's preachy it's a <UNK> of symbolism and obvious morality it's not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way it's just telling us things we already know that is if we can even figure out what it's saying br br this movie is simply art for <UNK> sake an attempt to say look at how deep and thought provoking we can be by using montage when a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject it <UNK> to be a film and simply becomes celluloid self <UNK>
<START> this movie has got to be the worse movie i have ever seen i only watched about a half an hour and i just shut it off the cars in this movie look like two <UNK> front ends <UNK> together this movie isn't even good for laughs the only time i laughed was when <UNK> kept saying in funny voice nobody can beat <UNK> i said holy god and shut it off bad bad movie 2 10
<START> with the obvious exception of fools horses this was in my opinion david <UNK> finest series br br coming straight after his tv debut on <UNK> not <UNK> your set ' these 13 episodes revealed a <UNK> of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days by comparison <UNK> open all hours and that awful series <UNK> man' did not come close br br i believe jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his <UNK> shame on him a new generation deserves to enjoy this the series actually <UNK> in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against 'the <UNK> which aired on bbc at the same time before <UNK> were <UNK> br br btw i have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant spencer was played by mark <UNK> alan <UNK> off <UNK> street i am amazed he didn't try to murder edgar <UNK>
<START> <UNK> the tv movie <UNK> a very twisted and version of the story about the greek superhero paul makes a good attempt to play this hero sean <UNK> <UNK> his sam image by playing <UNK> a thrown in character to make the whole thing a buddy movie picture i almost expected his to say at one point we're in a bad situation mr <UNK> uh i mean <UNK> an unexpected good performance comes from timothy dalton one of the lesser james bonds as father love interest looks like paris hilton something which just turned me off right away someone has twisted and the original story into somewhat of a murky and sometimes incomprehensible story the special effects don't help either while the <UNK> scene does the original story justice the lion and <UNK> are just well lame i believe the creatures and effects from power rangers <UNK> across my mind at least twice and the golden <UNK> felt rushed and very computer generated and they took out one of my favorite parts of what was originally a very cool story the movie can't decide whether it's greek roman or american and it almost ruined the original story a classic epic don't bother looking for this one on the direct to dvd c
<START> at initial thought the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag just for stan lee's amusement i expected nothing more than a sleazy animated version of <UNK> wire with low production values much like those short pieces of crap you see on adult swim for short term amusement but can never taken too seriously boy was i wrong br br has even better production values than similar marvel <UNK> the animation is very good and it seems that they've taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible br br the humor is good too on the sexy suggestive and sleazy side it is very similar if not exactly like the simpsons style you may encounter clichés and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless if this were running today i'd surely see it regularly its surprisingly one of the better <UNK> ever made
<START> i'm not into reality shows that much but this one is exceptional because at the end the viewer gets something useful out of it besides entertainment i don't have children but lessons will be a great help when and if i ever do my only complaint is that the show has been watered down since it has been in the us i prefer the british version with the <UNK> <UNK> approach is it just me or does anyone else find the us version to be a bit soft now it's the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i guess we <UNK> need a <UNK> of sugar to help the medicine go down after all still nothing wrong with a sappy happy ending is there
<START> br br man i just cant believe this movie i have watched it entirely believe me i have done this and the best part was the on the beginning and i hate br br no plot no acting no nothing i was watching the movie and thinking when this is going to start it never started how people can spend money and time to make such a crap br br the plot a dog gets bitten by a bat and get <UNK> okay until now no problem nothing special but ok now the rest of the movie will be the dog will chase people thats it nothing else now add to this some of the worse <UNK> actors i have ever seem some completely scenes and some others really idiotic like the child cant breath and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better and a very lame ending thats it here you have crap <UNK> <UNK> br br do your self a favor and make something more worthy like your head against the wall or play chess with yourself br br zero out of 10 br br gabriel
<START> i did a review for this director's fictional recreation about btk i had also seen this movie and it was terrible please save your money and time this movie was terrible and this director is <UNK> i do not understand how he is funding these movies they are horrible i have decided to make sure that i check who the writer director and producer are and if this director's name pops up i will not waste my money there is nothing worse than renting a movie on a friday night making the popcorn and then realizing you have been <UNK> by creative art on the front of the movie box stay away so i guess i should make up some stuff to fill in the lines i have always checked imdb for reviews before but i think i will not anymore this is ridiculous i have been <UNK> in my reviews far too many times not enough lines you may <UNK> my account your site is a pain
<START> well i'd have to say that i do own this film and i only like the ending the movie is boring and slow but the final fight is so funny lets just say that if the fake bird didn't attack the main evil guy this movie would be a 0 out of 10 the bird though makes it a 3 if you are truly bored or want something terrible to watch rent this and fast forward to the final battle
<START> i can't get this flick off my brain it's definitely totally different than anything that's out there i've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really <UNK> my world the way did there is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together it's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f ing hilarious black humour franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave i guess some politically won't appreciate the vibe don't bring your grandma but it is totally awesome the thing that's best is the style there is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road the movie really makes you sad and scared in parts but it also <UNK> your head with what is happening and the way it is filmed wtf is up with the world <UNK> many critics are raving about all these supposedly revolutionary ground breaking films and when you see them they're boring and predictable and not all that i don't get it because there are a lot of other better choices blind spot is really kinda great because it gives you thrills and chills and major upcoming star power but does it in a way that is completely fresh and definitely totally <UNK>
<START> i got subjected to this pile one <UNK> afternoon when my mother in law was watching it i can't get over someone basically doing a remake of a crappy high budget hollywood flop the core with washed up actors like luke perry if the high budget one <UNK> what makes people think doing the same movie 2 years later with no budget would go anywhere i was laughing through most of the movie because of how insanely similar it was in fact i am shocked it's not held up in legal rather than airing on tv and how it was basically the script of the core just <UNK> badly which if you have seen the core you know why doing it worse is funny since the core was already so bad it was funny br br if you enjoy getting a laugh out of really bad movies this one will be right up your alley the only thing i can say is that i wish luke perry was able to have a career because he isn't a horrible actor he just lands horrible roles crappy made for tv movies that will only run on daytime television is pretty much one step closer to the end for him if it wasn't for <UNK> he would have a career
<START> okay i know that's cliché taken on its surface this is a bad film perhaps in a league with plan 9 from outer space the dialog is suspect but the is quite enjoyable the plot is not quite believable <UNK> character overacts <UNK> while watching the movie somethings happen that truly make you wonder handsome and kim making out on a tank <UNK> eating a banana in a bath just about everything <UNK> says and does these things taken <UNK> are perhaps flaws taken together however they are merely quirks watching this movie with an open mind especially if you're not familiar with <UNK> culture and with an open minded group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughs and a memorable time you can't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece or even expecting to take anything serious at all if you can take this film for what it is an underdog film about <UNK> filled to the <UNK> with its own quirks then you should have a good time watching this one i've already seen it three times and i wouldn't hesitate to watch it three more times
<START> wow here is another great golf movie that's at least three in the past few years that i've really enjoyed that were well done beautifully filmed and inspirational the other two were bobby jones stroke of genius and the legend of <UNK> vance br br this is a true underdog story if there ever was one to have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the united states open golf <UNK> is an <UNK> of feat i believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished how much of this film is fiction <UNK> for dramatic effect i don't know i do know that i plan on reading the book and i know that in real life francis had a three stroke lead in with just two holes to go unlike what we saw in the film br br whatever francis victory over golf legends harry and ted ray is fact it is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here it isn't something just for golf fans this is a fun movie to actor turned director bill paxton for an outstanding job br br yes a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him it's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance the movie also deals with demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an sport which it was at the time for both europeans and americans br br <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> as as is steven as for those who don't know was like the tiger woods of his day maybe even more <UNK> in the film is <UNK> as a warm nice guy a genuine human being the other major <UNK> ray stephen marcus is shown as somewhat of a <UNK> nasty guy br br the fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film a fifth grade boy who winds up being <UNK> in the open he josh <UNK> brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie br br if all of this a with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole were not true you would think oh man this is so hokey who could believe this that's what makes this true life story fun to see finally captured on film as with another sports film of 2005 cinderella man here is another excellent movie that got <UNK> ignored when it came to awards i guess nice films don't win awards just the hearts of their viewers
<START> i think this is a great classic monster film for the family the mole what a machine the tall creature with the <UNK> the flying green <UNK> or whatever they are and the ape men things the speak <UNK> with them the battle of the men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast <UNK> <UNK> class what else can i say how would they make a 2002 remake of this one
<START> plot none script a string of cliches acting not in evidence special effects title sequence kind of cool but otherwise exceptionally poor fright factor crossing the road is scarier cult factor only the most desperate cult would <UNK> onto this dog can't you say anything positive i did the titles were kind of cool br br special bonus question your idea of hell being at a party with people who voted this flop a 7
<START> the turner classic movie channel has spent the month of january doing the films of one of my favorite actors robert <UNK> his films are mostly rarely watched these days except for those that were <UNK> for most of his career meaning that the roles that frequently <UNK> on television are they were <UNK> the lady in the lake june bride night must fall the <UNK> charm ride the pink horse rage in heaven the earl of chicago in short the films he fought to get the roles in because they were not the usual comic fluff he usually appeared in it's ironic that nowadays when one thinks of <UNK> career it is the films that were mostly made after <UNK> that are pushed the ones that broke the original image that mgm and louis b <UNK> pushed the pity of this is that <UNK> was a gifted comedian and saved many films from being routine br br <UNK> fever is one such film made in 1936 with jim and trouble for two it was a <UNK> year of good performances by <UNK> and helped lead to his being able to convince the powers that be at mgm to allow him to play danny in night must fall the next year br br <UNK> fever is set in <UNK> and <UNK> is a weather station <UNK> there named he has been living there for five years and has not been in the company of a woman except for <UNK> women for most of that time he has a girlfriend of sorts named clara <UNK> who he sort of <UNK> to but it's been two years since he has heard from her so that he believes she has given up on him br br world is <UNK> when sir james <UNK> and irene <UNK> owen and myrna loy show up they were flying to toronto for a business meeting that <UNK> was to address <UNK> is engaged to but finds her enchanting and gradually she finds him equally attractive certainly the pompous self important and hopelessly inept <UNK> is no competition it is a measure of <UNK> acting that he keeps the character entertaining even if one finds it hard to believe such a <UNK> is a canadian captain of industry br br there is something surreal about this film probably due to the original play while the <UNK> scenery is quite phony looking it does serve it's purpose for the comedy witness <UNK> polar bear sequence but the height of the <UNK> is the dinner serves his guests a dinner of which owen eats with real gusto owen a minor noble as a is dressed in normal clothing a winter suit for the climate but <UNK> is dressed in his suit of evening dress as though attending a ball at the <UNK> loy seeing him dress up likewise puts on a <UNK> they are being served by servant assistant the <UNK> otto who is wearing a suit of evening dress too it turns out that it is <UNK> owen who earlier insisted that change into clothing more suitable to his station is the only person who is <UNK> dressed for this dinner <UNK> was <UNK> most elegant actor in a <UNK> or evening dress <UNK> tone was the his closest rival it is a toss up in movie if <UNK> or fred astaire was the more elegant figure in such suits hard to decide br br the course of love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama clara shows up we are <UNK> off too early about this at the start of the film when we see her on an ship will break with clara will irene break with <UNK> the film is funny and loy and <UNK> make a nice couple they had appeared together in one other film and both were in separate scenes in a second before this movie but this would be their last film together br br one last interesting point at the start of the film when the credits are shown you see <UNK> of men and women in comic situations they are based on the art work of john held jr the great <UNK> <UNK> of the 1920s and 1930s who was the <UNK> of the <UNK> and jazz age it's an unusual choice as it has absolutely nothing to do with the film's plot or <UNK>
<START> <UNK> des directed by the brilliant <UNK> georges <UNK> is a film to treasure because it is one of the best <UNK> of french film making of the <UNK> years m <UNK> adapting the novel longtime <UNK> shows his genius in the way he sets the story and in the way he all the characters in this deeply satisfying movie that as has pointed out in this forum it demonstrates how influential was and how much the next generation of french movie makers are <UNK> to the master especially claude <UNK> br br the crisp black and white cinematography by <UNK> has been <UNK> transferred to the <UNK> dvd we recently watched working with <UNK> makes the most of the dark tones and the shadows in most of the key scenes the music by francis lopez a man who created light music and in france works well in the context of the film since the action takes place in the world of the music <UNK> and night <UNK> br br louis <UNK> who is seen as a police detective is perfect in the part this was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a <UNK> of the french theater <UNK> clearly understood well the <UNK> for the creation of his police inspector who is <UNK> and can look deeply into the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from the others in an unfair comment by someone in this page <UNK> inspector is compared with peter <UNK> columbo the television detective frankly and no <UNK> to mr falk intended it's like comparing a great <UNK> to a good house wine br br bernard <UNK> is perfect as the jealous husband <UNK> had the kind of face that one could associate with the man consumed with the passion his wife jenny <UNK> has <UNK> in him <UNK> is vulnerable and doesn't act <UNK> he is an easy suspect because he has done everything wrong as he finds in the middle of a crime he didn't commit but all the evidence points to the contrary br br the other great character in the film is <UNK> the photographer it's clear by the way she <UNK> with jenny where her real interest lies <UNK> is <UNK> appealing as this troubled woman and makes an enormous contribution to the film <UNK> playing jenny is appealing as the singer who suddenly leaps from obscurity to celebrity and <UNK> the kind of men like the old <UNK> br br the film is one of the best <UNK> directed during his distinguished career and one that will live forever because the way he brought all the elements together
<START> this is a disappointing adaptation of the james lee burke novel in the electric <UNK> of the <UNK> dead it is rather poorly acted mainly due to the <UNK> of the principal players tommy lee jones a normally fine actor just doesn't capture <UNK> dave as main nemesis john goodman does a sloppy job as the heavy the guy who plays actor buddy doesn't look like a former a <UNK> leading man the rest of the movie is mainly cast with no name locals who just don't do justice to a big time novel br br the movie and jones' performance is way too <UNK> for one thing in <UNK> series of novels gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time being laid back and slow moving this is just like the deep south and southern <UNK> then at times is nearly manic in his jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie he doesn't <UNK> ned beatty is wasted mary <UNK> is out of place about the only good thing about this is the setting on the whole the movie gives one the impression of a tv movie
<START> i watched this movie having never read the book and took the characters at face value but having already been introduced to them watched it again recently i got a whole different viewpoint out of the film br br without the burden of having to focus <UNK> on each character learning their quirks and <UNK> allowed me to focus on the cultural issues laid out in the film the farm families of <UNK> are so <UNK> inter related as they are in the area of indiana where i grew up in the 40's and 50's that i immediately recognized the back stories and motives behind the characters perhaps jane <UNK> did mean for us to see beyond the superficial into the world these people had to live but viewers are so caught up in the hollywood aura of the individual actors that they miss a rich <UNK> of a lifestyle that exists less and less as each decade passes another film with these characteristics is the bridges of madison county try watching both of these films again with an eye to the whole picture
<START> susan sarandon she made this movie for me i've never appreciated her acting more than as i did in this movie she really acted as though she were adele august i can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable br br natalie portman as ann august helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie the movie was about them so the other characters were <UNK> br br i gave this movie an eight rating but susan received a ten from me because of her performance as far as relationship movies go <UNK> and terms of <UNK> had a greater impact on me than this movie but i highly recommend it
<START> come on now how did all of these talented actors actresses end up in this mess was it some sort of blackmail lost bet situation <UNK> you are a muscle man be what you were born to be br br the hot <UNK> scene the <UNK> scene i was expecting to hear the <UNK> dragging over the record sound at any point br br and what was up with him carrying around the priceless dickens <UNK> with him let's see i'm drunk at a bar why not pull out the priceless dickens <UNK> i'm going to meet some questionable thugs down on the edge of the <UNK> why not take my priceless dickens <UNK> br br <UNK> br br terrible avoid
<START> troma <UNK> lloyd kaufman is the in this anthology film made up of two films that were such celluloid <UNK> that tried to salvage them by combining the two into one anthology film and throwing in <UNK> amounts of nudity whenever possible does it work nope it's still crap that i'd have to <UNK> off my boots if i stepped in it will anyone like this mess sure young teen aged <UNK> with the combined <UNK> of a vienna <UNK> have to laugh at something i guess for those who have brains that are even semi <UNK> steer clear though and watch something less insulting to your intelligence even dude where's my car would do br br my grade f
<START> a quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> slash fest the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die however delivers considerably more br br rather than focus on bare flesh and gore though there is a little of each no sex however the flick focuses on delivering impending dread <UNK> tension amidst a lovely <UNK> backdrop these feelings are further <UNK> by a cast of realistically likable characters and <UNK> that are more amoral than cardboard <UNK> of evil oh yeah george kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing br br if you liked wrong turn then watch this to see where much of its' <UNK> came from
<START> <UNK> is the first of its kind in turkish cinema and it's way better than i expected those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point it's not all that great indeed but it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur so it's basically a maiden voyage and comparing this one to other films such as the 1st class garbage propaganda this movie is pretty damn good br br one thing that must be said it deals with the <UNK> <UNK> life in turkey very realistically that's exactly how it goes the scenes that are meant to scare are somewhat cheap and <UNK> most of them even if not all but that religion lesson scene made me laugh in tears and performs the best acting of this flick as a religion teacher br br it's not a waste of your time go and watch it you'll find it rather amusing especially if you know turkey enough to relate to turkish school lives
<START> this is a voice of a person who just finished watching the second season of rome almost at one go and grabbed the opportunity to see what happened next this film conveniently takes off where rome ends if you find rome an abomination a foul mouthed screw fest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy <UNK> but if you feel rome is a good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of <UNK> and the work of the actors then will obviously appear to you as an overly <UNK> superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors br br there are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome i especially disliked image of <UNK> as a drug <UNK> sex addict there must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman and the actress in suits the part much better o'toole and <UNK> are good and so are some others but then if you have come to know and love as the super cool bitch you'll find the depiction of her in as a tear <UNK> mother <UNK> in an <UNK> absolutely ridiculous there are supposed to be some bitchy characters in but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more you'll find no interesting female characters in this epic there's also the painfully comic whom we see as a <UNK> drag queen even though there is little historical evidence that he was such he's once referred to as being <UNK> in his pleasures in the <UNK> br br the interiors are rather <UNK> and rely on clichés upon clichés big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children's play room in an egyptian theme park there's a of really poor 3d graphics not up to 2003 standards br br the action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged <UNK> is <UNK> so we get a quick look at some historical events some of which are presented well whereas some are not an amount of time is wasted to show <UNK> as the eternal flame of <UNK> this affair doesn't <UNK> for even a moment the dialog is <UNK> and everything is seasoned with tacky tear inducing musical score whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry <UNK> dubbing most of the actors are non english <UNK> br br everything is <UNK> in this epic true there are more historical <UNK> than in rome but dramatically speaking it's plain boring the characters lack depth and the dialog <UNK> camera work is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please your eye br br there's really no one to love and no one to hate in regardless of whether you liked or disliked rome there are much better films and miniseries around ancient rome the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing i recommend
<START> this movie really sucks sucks really really hard this movie should be in the bottom 100 but it is so bad that almost nobody has seen it to vote for her so many times that it should be at the same time of <UNK> the hands of fate i should have him position 1 awful but the reason for which i put him 2 was for eve the girl of the town that besides some scenes of nudity besides i thought of voting for 3 but like they killed eve i returned at 2 it is that movies like this they should not be <UNK> by anybody since not even they took to the fame or other productions to the actors main great <UNK> <UNK> the history of a mining ghost that kills to and after they put an end to their <UNK> it <UNK> because with the end they it very ugly br br final score vote 2 for the nudity and the performance of the beautiful eve
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i could hardly stay awake the acting and the plot were horrible i like b movies but this movie has nothing that could make me laugh or think about ok there were two or three funny moments at the beginning so i have to give this movie 2 out of 10 if you really want to watch it watch the first 10 minutes after that you will get more and more disappointed while the movie runs
<START> as a i got the <UNK> jokes very funny make fun of <UNK> ann <UNK> all those lame <UNK> of detroit yes yes i've heard these jokes a million times i'll give them credit for accurately depicting the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> it couldn't get more white did you hear those lovely <UNK> <UNK> accents where the girls talk so fast you can't understand one word that comes out of their mouth nose as much as i love <UNK> i hated this movie br br i have never met one person from <UNK> <UNK> that i liked listen to that awful live band and that annoying and horrid background music what is that one of your gross <UNK> band probably wow what a great detroit scene you guys have over there funny how people from <UNK> <UNK> always say they're from detroit they're so white and rich they wish they had something to complain about br br anyway this movie blows all the way from the lame jokes about girls in <UNK> to the terrible character development oh wait a minute you mean the entire basis for a character is that he says the f word a lot what a deep personality great job <UNK> <UNK> and i love all the sexist <UNK> like how the narrator calls the first girl who gets killed that we never even hear speak a naive b <UNK> that's really lovely br br and those <UNK> masks with the marilyn <UNK> contact <UNK> are really great and i love how it made perfect sense as to why the <UNK> came by and killed people and how their <UNK> master had such a obvious role in the movie the main boyfriend dude was so boring i fell asleep looking at him the three idiot guys or was it two or four how can i tell they all look and act the same were so desperately trying to make me laugh but <UNK> and <UNK> already got out my butt humor laughs back in 1994 and what's with the gay jokes no wonder this movie sucked everyone involved must have some minor problems with their <UNK> eh boys br br the only saving grace to this film was the main girl despite what the other people on here have said she actually was a good actress teenage girls talk the way she talked they really act the way she acted her acting was very natural and believable i really thought she was a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> store employee maybe she is and yeah she had big boobs most the women here do <UNK> is the state in the union you know in all aspects br br so those of you who think this is a representation of detroit it's not it's the <UNK> of detroit they are very white and full of <UNK> teen angst limp yes is from one of our <UNK> and 75 <UNK> <UNK> pants all the way lame rich kids who are mad because they have lots of money and nothing to complain about and they make bad movies too br br
<START> this is a parody that means there are no characters as such they are all plain stereotypes and the movie relies completely on the quality of the jokes br br well there are quite some good jokes in this movie unfortunately they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones if one expects all dialogues to be absurd the fun wears off br br you see there is american pie 2 my all time favorite teenager movie it contains a lot of real original characters maybe the jokes are tasteless but all the people have some kind of live for example they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens that is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny br br not so this movie every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody so there are no characters at all therefore there is really no room for any sympathy too if you know the original movies you know whole scenes in advance add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all and you have this movie br br the only thing that saved me from getting completely bored where in fact the comments from some teenagers in the cinema where i was watching the film br br ah and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of melissa joan hart in one scene sigh she is just too cool she can't be real hmm worth a whole movie
<START> i think it's two years ago since i have seen the movie and till this day it's the worst film i have ever seen the only thing i thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for some tax reason so after all this time i finally <UNK> my gut and now imdb says i have to fill 10 lines with comments br br sorry you must provide at least 10 lines in your comment please return to the edit window or use the back option if this isn't a new window br br please there is nothing to say anymore br br sorry for some bad english

<START> i wasn't expecting a whole lot when i rented this film as a lot of independent films seem to be a bit overrated these days well hollywood films too for that matter but this movie was fantastic really great it's too bad it didn't reach a huge audience because it's just superb i really love <UNK> determination it really makes me look upon my life as a gift and i see how <UNK> i am just to have an education but all of that aside this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story no matter what the budget it's an excellent film and everyone should watch it they will love it and definitely learn something from it i don't have to be roger ebert to know it's one of the best movies i've seen all year and certainly one of the most truthful
<START> this is one of my favorite t v shows of all time <UNK> <UNK> is simply a genius and it's only fitting that i chose this to be my 1000 review i can't begin to tell you how much i love mr bean he's the man and what <UNK> me is how he gets out of these incredibly difficult situations and he is always so creative plus <UNK> <UNK> also deserves <UNK> he is also a genius my favorite bit that he has done is the amazing adventures of mr bean and while all the rest of them are amazing this remains my true favorite plus i wish the show didn't stop so soon each episode is brilliantly written and they were all masterfully directed plus each episode is a classic in my eyes this show is incredibly popular and i can definitely see why as it's quite possibly the funniest show ever the character actors all played there roles really well especially <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> this is one of my favorite t v shows of all time <UNK> is simply put a genius and an incredibly talented comedian possibly the best and it's only fitting that i chose this to be my 1000 review f you haven't seen this show drop what your doing right now and go check it out you will not regret it trust me it's one of the best t v shows ever and i will continue to watch the show over and over again i never tire of it mr bean rules out of 5
<START> i at first thought this little fantasy <UNK> would be a little entertaining i was wrong br br a good cast roy <UNK> as the president didn't help it any the story had every <UNK> possible worst case scenario that could take place in a terrorist nuclear disaster and none of it could possibly happen br br true the kidnapping of the president could only be accomplished with the inside help of a <UNK> in the secret service ala air force one but everything they depicted regarding the football and the <UNK> of our country if were to fall into enemy hands is ludicrous to the <UNK> degree seriously not even the president can fully over ride our missile control the case is only used to <UNK> orders in this situation our system would have completely deleted the <UNK> and the whole thing would go nowhere the destruction of <UNK> couldn't happen there would not have been a missile launch because the <UNK> <UNK> would have been <UNK> not to <UNK> include a system there are just too many safe guards to prevent such a thing from happening br br true film's like fail safe and <UNK> gave some credibility to the concept of us losing control of the system but this film goes too far and fails to suspend my concept of the unbelievable and that makes the experience a waste of the viewer's time this film is a failure
<START> if you want to see a horror film which is horrible and in very bad taste this is definitely the film to view this films starts out with two young teenagers getting wild ideas about going into a chat room and going out on blind dates and quite possibly they will wind up like a little <UNK> to the slaughter house plenty of blood gore nudity <UNK> and all kinds of blood <UNK> <UNK> and things you will never dream a person is capable of performing on men and women if you like <UNK> well this kind of <UNK> deals with heavy heavy <UNK> and plenty of besides lots of <UNK> and thread to seal up things on the human body i really hope that this film does not give some sick person in this world the idea to act out these horrors in real life
<START> this film probably would have been good if they didn't use cgi computer generated imagery for the werewolf scenes it made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonish cgi is great for certain effects like the in jurassic park or <UNK> but when we see a film where the creature must look completely real cgi is not the way to go look at an american werewolf in london no cgi just makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel this film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but it's nothing more than a film that i thought was o k and that's not good enough in my opinion an american werewolf in paris doesn't hold up to the original
<START> young <UNK> who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day nervous and overly polite to hide her own sexual <UNK> she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom but not so happy when he begins <UNK> out the window at night sandy dennis is not a hapless actress but why she was attracted to these sad sack roles i guess we'll never know based on a book by richard miles and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get this lurid material not only attracted dennis but also director robert altman whose work is static at best the narrative seems almost a sex <UNK> of the collector a tag which may have sold the film rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea <UNK> even the film's best sequence dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner doesn't quite come off with sandy acting both ill and <UNK> whose idea was this plan michael burns is quite good as the kid who uses this <UNK> <UNK> sick woman just for her <UNK> <UNK> but he's handled too <UNK> by altman with lots of <UNK> placed <UNK> and flesh colored <UNK> altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point sandy dennis has a handful of very good scenes she doesn't <UNK> away <UNK> here she thinks before she speaks and she's <UNK> careful in her actions unfortunately the role itself is a <UNK> with an apparent slide into mental <UNK> which seems to happen off screen as such the abrupt finale is <UNK> and the overall results tepid 1 2 from
<START> while the design and locations and photography are strong <UNK> in this film it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth br br the case is the use of the soundtrack music a mix of <UNK> and andrew lloyd <UNK> that plays constantly and <UNK> and would have made max <UNK> <UNK> at its over use as it <UNK> the audience how difficult how <UNK> how tortured it is to be an artist and then it really counts the story the details at the end br br this <UNK> and <UNK> exploitation of emotions was once well <UNK> by peter <UNK> about a <UNK> <UNK> book this is not writing this is barbara <UNK> precisely the same critique can be made of this film a <UNK> <UNK> vanity project
<START> for avid sci fi fans this movie is just what you've been waiting for watching this movie gets you lost into the characters especially <UNK> the movies bad guy this is the case where you root for the bad guy and want to see him live and win as you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive you long to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet an excellent movie <UNK> <UNK> did a wonderful job as convict <UNK> and the acting and suspense were ravishing a
<START> the plot a group of young people with ridiculous names <UNK> and october are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend <UNK> after the funeral they decide to <UNK> up their late friend's <UNK> among them is a video game called stay alive the group decides there's no better way to show their grief than to all <UNK> in a little virtual bloodshed but the more they play the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor ol' <UNK> br br the production this film is just another entry into the latest hollywood <UNK> of low budget pg 13 horror aimed at <UNK> in on the junior high school crowd the direction is sloppy to say the least with quick music video style cuts that make the action difficult to follow the dialog is so bad that it actually kills brain cells the plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from or why those who play it die br br the idea behind this film although not entirely original had some promise but the poor execution on both sides of the camera make this one big dud br br if you've ever got a <UNK> for a killing someone in a video game makes them dead in real life horror film take my advice and skip stay alive for the superior
<START> this sad romance is because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters so there are a lot of flashbacks of re shooting of the same scene but it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the <UNK> in order to see the result br br and it would worth it because it's for me just one the best french movie ever made br br it has everything br br cast first steps of monica <UNK> and vincent <UNK> such a presence and such voices even for a hard of hearing it's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie br br directing his camera is bright alive plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close up <UNK> la david lynch br br cinematography the light is beautiful between gold and <UNK> like their love br br a never seen before paris it's a paris out of time of more accurately a <UNK> of a lot of <UNK> huge search here it's look like <UNK> city modern and old at the same time br br music not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames and the song of charles made me discover this great singer br br ah  the story as i said it's a love story but rather tragic saying that love can be for nothing that it doesn't make all people happy or isn't guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isn't often told love is passion which is derivative from the latin pain you can suffer a lot when you are in love because of the why of the endless waiting the lack of courage the <UNK> br br and when you can ease yourself fate destiny god devil can stab you in the back just because you arrive too soon or too late and above all because love means 2 in a world of <UNK> a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written so what's love br br personally i lived some moments like this in a car with the dear one her mobile rings and you know it's her special friend whom she kisses goodbye and not you even if we are always together so you want to go out of this car to leave them together to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can't because an amazing hard rain just started br br i found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else
<START> an excellent thriller of all time <UNK> <UNK> excels as director and editor performances by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> kumar prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the <UNK> detail cinematography adds to the mystery <UNK> and other <UNK> of the story as it <UNK> and to top it all music by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is unforgettable <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by kumar <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> main by <UNK> again <UNK> <UNK> unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own
<START> i'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one when i was watching this movie a couple viewers next to me <UNK> whenever you're supposed to <UNK> or at least feel touched like when hunting said he didn't love the girl like when robin <UNK> character sorry i forgot his <UNK> name was telling hunting repeatedly it's not your fault oh lord just thinking of that scene gives me the <UNK> i couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters many people <UNK> for hollywood <UNK> characters they can't even relate to think titanic <UNK> but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre i guess i simply refuse to be <UNK> and emotionally manipulated by all this br br folks it's not me who's being condescending those characters are and for no good reason because they're unreal worse yet nothing is new or surprising even robin <UNK> character is all cliched br br i gave it 1 out of 10 it's probably not that bad it's just quite mediocre but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so i figured a single <UNK> vote won't hurt
<START> i actually enjoyed if not for much more than mocking the production values dennis hopper was just fine although i wonder if he would have signed on the project had he seen the special effects they used and furthermore what was with the scene with the ninja that was just completely out of pace perhaps someone came up with the bright idea mid shooting oh well this movie is great if you're drunk and need a good laugh cheers
<START> now infamous western that was at its time the biggest budgeted disaster in hollywood history i was lucky enough to see the full <UNK> minute version at a theatre in 1990 it was truly <UNK> how bad the film was br br they had a great cast a story based on a true incident a fight between <UNK> and americans in the <UNK> magnificent scenery so what went wrong three words director michael <UNK> he was so full of himself after the deer hunter he went out and made this god awful western he's not totally to blame his previous film the deer hunter was considered a masterpiece and united artists gave him free reign to do anything they let him all alone and everything went wrong the cost went <UNK> out of control and <UNK> insisted on <UNK> sequences again and again until they were perfect br br first off the sound is horrible entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying for instance jeff <UNK> character is introduced during a dance sequence but i still have no idea who he was the dialogue in his <UNK> scene is incomprehensible that's the director's fault he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on the story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and <UNK> took great liberties with the facts in the real story only one person was killed <UNK> turns it into a massacre there is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre all the <UNK> sound that way br br this garbage effectively closed down united artists and was the end of <UNK> career a <UNK> example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing jeff bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did this is from a guy who made <UNK> a definite must miss br br there is a pretty good book called the final cut which details the whole disaster this gets a 1 i wish imdb had negative numbers this deserves it
<START> if you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war you need to see called the <UNK> are flying in english it tells the story of <UNK> <UNK> and boris who are in love on the verge of wwii they are walking along the <UNK> watching the <UNK> fly by when the war starts boris is promptly sent off to war <UNK> hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son whom she does not love boris meanwhile continues <UNK> through the countryside fighting the nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until he he runs out of energy when <UNK> working in a military hospital receives this news she refuses to accept it until <UNK> body arrives home on one of the trains simultaneously the radio <UNK> that germany has <UNK> and the allied powers have won the war the soviet union lost 27 million citizens but it's the start of a new era br br this movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield but also how it affected the <UNK> population this is definitely a movie that everyone should see
<START> yeah great cult tv series great atmosphere top script and good performances make this a class a candidate for dvd release br br this is a <UNK> tour de force of australian tv history and has that unforgettable <UNK> period piece soundtrack with doug <UNK> and <UNK> voice <UNK> 70's all over your <UNK> ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its glory this is a <UNK> from another and not too distant era and has the proud <UNK> of the land mighty down under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty <UNK> br br come on abc get with the program and release this cool 70's cult baby for all to enjoy or re enjoy if you're lucky enough to have lived the dream at the time
<START> ok so in any <UNK> e <UNK> road runner cartoons we know that is going to set up all sorts of traps for <UNK> but always himself in various ways that certainly happens in <UNK> <UNK> predictable i guess that it is but when you think about it these cartoons show how the more you try to harm someone else the more you get <UNK> sort of like how <UNK> duck always tries to <UNK> bugs <UNK> integrity but bugs sees around it br br overall this is another classic from the <UNK> <UNK> crowd sometimes i think that if we really had wanted to ease cold war tensions we could have just let the soviet union see looney tunes cartoons i'm sure that they would have loved them another great one br br ps i learned on <UNK> that <UNK> e middle name is
<START> this was answer to fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right <UNK> <UNK> was good and so was sunny <UNK> but it was shah rukh khan who shot to fame as the stalker since then he has become a favourite of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and de india shah rukh at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him the scripting was superb and the songs were my favourites are too mere and <UNK> br br after the dismal failure of the underrated <UNK> <UNK> fought back with <UNK> the dialogues were memorable the k k <UNK> dialogue is often repeated since <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has slipped bit <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with <UNK> <UNK> which was far far better this was <UNK> <UNK> last masterpiece
<START> i have to <UNK> this by saying that i love watching bad movies that are entertaining this movie delivers 100 it is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen it is full of crappy stock footage of random stuff in a city people walking traffic the <UNK> etc that doesn't tie into anything then there are the overly long <UNK> scenes ' these involve lots of <UNK> and frequent <UNK> of <UNK> on each other's bodies these are in no way erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie this is especially true for the shower scene where two of the so called girls who couldn't be a day over 40 are <UNK> each other with blood but there is also a crew member <UNK> blood in the from the outside while one of the girls keeps smiling at him no one had to <UNK> any lines for this movie if they aren't clearly reading cards then they have a magazine in front of them they keep <UNK> at while they struggle through awkward dialogue then there's mr he throws ed <UNK> name around like he can somehow compare but he is far far from anything of that quality he walks around a cemetery <UNK> about random things that went wrong in the movie which really helps the complete lack of flow the movie already had going on we couldn't stop laughing during this movie except during the sex scenes where we were <UNK> out and occasionally horrified br br i give this movie a 1 10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie
<START> the film's <UNK> is you think you know who you are you have no idea i reject both the suggested idea that i have no idea who i am and the <UNK> suggestion that this film tells me who people truly are if people in real life are really like this then man we're screwed br br a <UNK> film that i walked into late and left <UNK> a film which is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming the race film of all time that it loses sight of the very tools a film must use br br the rules of hollywood are such if you show something in the first half it must be used in the second half thus the gun that the daughter <UNK> about her father buying will somehow find its way into the story in the second half the rules of hollywood are to make dialog <UNK> a concept which changes with every decade is this <UNK> somehow less ludicrous than the <UNK> of kevin smith ten years ago the rules of hollywood state that we set the scene and as action rises the camera moves in closer to the faces in this film primarily so we can see the supposed shame <UNK> and <UNK> realism of the characters the strings increase the frame rate slows down and our heart is meant to break br br this film is as <UNK> manipulative as it is vapid i have my own prejudices against l a which i <UNK> admit so to combat this prejudice i will not say that this is a natural situation <UNK> from the location but rather probably from the author and director the writer paul <UNK> already showed a taste for <UNK> over humanity in his million dollar baby which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best of a <UNK> ideas now that paul <UNK> has his own hands on the camera it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write true natural human drama he does not know how to photograph or direct it as well paul <UNK> comes from the land of tv let us not forget the land of <UNK> expectations br br everything is as obvious as a tv movie simply presented for simple minds <UNK> <UNK> into us over and over again that while on the surface people may seem to be awful they have secret pains hidden this is a nice idea but so presented that the whole <UNK> of bad good has an amateurish feel <UNK> the film is broken up in the tradition of <UNK> and other earlier films the editing is as typical and <UNK> cinematic as could be if there is a dramatic movement such as a door opening or a car driving past between the subject and camera the <UNK> use that extreme movement to give the cut that occurs there a more <UNK> quality the problem is that other than the drive to keep things moving there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts everything is kept by the books not only are the puppets of this hideous racial punch and judy show <UNK> handled but even the <UNK> are <UNK> and raised with incompetence br br the film tries desperately to present reality but there's just no talent whatsoever some of the actors are good some of the actors are bad and all of the performance get <UNK> together brought down by the low low <UNK> of the film we have cinematography which is technically clear we can see the scene we have a clear understanding of what is happening however not only is the cinematography <UNK> but it is <UNK> camera work and framing which believes that it actually is inspired the result is little <UNK> <UNK> which one <UNK> but do not actually add anything to the drama or pathos for example and this is a spoiler as a father holds his dying child the father might be shot too i didn't stick around to find out the camera sees his face and gives us the famous vertigo track zoom the vertigo shot it was at this point that the film became hysterical and i just had to leave i had to leave because it was so bad i left because i was in the middle of a crowded theater and i wanted to express to the audience that i was sick of hollywood <UNK> which is full of sound and fury yet <UNK> nothing in the <UNK> own words i hate to waste such good <UNK> references on something this remarkably bad
<START> this film has absolutely no redeeming features it's not even worthy of being in the <UNK> bad it's <UNK> category it's simply bad badly acted badly shot badly written badly directed terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur quite how this got a release is beyond me br br oh and could someone please tell the lead actress that if you're playing that does not mean that you should constantly <UNK> with your hair in a film that was generally irritating this was probably one of the most irritating things of all br br on the plus side i think this is the only film ever to feature a nazi
<START> i just saw this movie at the berlin film <UNK> children's program and it just killed me and pretty much everyone else in the audience and make no mistake about it this film belongs into the all time 250 let me tell you that i'm in no way associated with the creators of this film if that's what you come to believe reading this no but this actually is it <UNK> the kid's film label on it <UNK> girl is on almost every account a classic as in biblical the story concerns 12 year old <UNK> <UNK> julie who is <UNK> to learn of her <UNK> <UNK> illness special surgery in the us would cost 1 5 million and of course nobody could afford that so <UNK> and her friends <UNK> and sebastian do what every good kid would and <UNK> a bank sounds corny don't forget this is not america and is by no means the tear <UNK> robin williams <UNK> <UNK> du <UNK> nobody takes seriously anyway director <UNK> set out to make a big budget action comedy for kids and boy did he succeed let me put it this way this film rocks like no kid film and few others did before and there's a whole lot more to it than just the action after about 20 minutes of by the numbers exposition well granted it into a monster that br br effortlessly puts mission impossible to shame the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look real expensive take that mummy br br <UNK> almost every other movie suspense wise no easy they're only kids antics here br br easily <UNK> a dense story with enough laughs to make jim carrey look for career <UNK> br br <UNK> to both damon <UNK> and karate kid within the same seconds br br comes up with so much wicked humor that side of p c that i can hear the american ratings board wet their pants from over here br br manages to actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time what am i saying they're kids they're kids <UNK> watch that last scene br br stars <UNK> anderson who since last years is everybody's favourite kid actor br br what a ride
<START> i saw recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival and i can't believe that this is official <UNK> to the <UNK> academy awards to be considered for best foreign film producer anna anthony last year also had official <UNK> for best foreign film with i wasn't personally a fan of but at least it had some production value to it this could have been shot as a high school film project as a short film it may have worked but as a feature film it is as lost as it's characters this is a story about five twenty something friends who live in a small swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long gone childhood actually isn't like some remote northern swedish village it's a popular summer resort with a population of city and <UNK> of almost 40 000 and lies between two major southern <UNK> swedish cities of and the characters are likable enough guys but if they were high school age kids with a bleak or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives i would undoubtedly care about them more they are however long past the point where they should be making plans to deal with <UNK> if they want to stay in forever than certainly there must be some jobs in the tourist or fishing industry instead of just riding <UNK> drinking smoking pot and occasionally painting a house maybe if they hung around with a girl or two in their circle of friends of which girls are absent from this film altogether which doesn't make sense makes his directorial debut and co wrote the film along with the cinematographer of which i use the term loosely <UNK> the acting isn't too bad i would give this a 4 5 out of 10 but despite it's <UNK> for consideration for the academy awards i would not recommend it
<START> maximum risk is a step <UNK> for van damme and just more of the uninspired b movie action stuff we've come to expect from films featuring the macho <UNK> martial artist the flick has <UNK> plots holes goofs <UNK> a messy plot and a gorgeous <UNK> who spends most of her time looking like she's waiting for a cue maximum risk doesn't <UNK> itself in any way and will likely not have much appeal beyond the usual young male audiences c
<START> this movie was a pleasant surprise because i didn't expect much i didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in major <UNK> while moving on to the matrix is not a plus in my book hated it i'm sure it's a career plus for hugo james <UNK> is great in this and jennifer <UNK> sweet and wonderful it seemed sometimes like a <UNK> street romp 30 years later but i enjoyed the <UNK> shop <UNK> <UNK> clothes mixed up with the modern <UNK> of sexual and gender <UNK> the real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his <UNK> is loads of fun the iron john <UNK> group <UNK> are a bit dated but i still loved them it's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old carry on movies the british know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition unlike the united states which is too <UNK> to really understand that sex is funny
<START> the <UNK> is a very worthwhile addition to recent re releases from the soviet union director 1977 film <UNK> the moral <UNK> of <UNK> and honor in german occupied russia during the second world war on foot and in a <UNK> two members of a <UNK> soviet group leave to locate supplies and are captured by nazi soldiers the focus of the movie is on how each man handles or <UNK> his moral <UNK> one chooses dignity and integrity while the other <UNK> for collaboration with the enemy however in the end he cannot <UNK> by his selfish decision the film makes much use of slow wide angle pans which shift to extreme closeups and highlight the spiritual <UNK> within the souls of each man this is not a great film but it does effectively portray an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and <UNK> soviet wilderness
<START> this movie is recommended only for <UNK> it will <UNK> them by putting them to sleep five year olds might also enjoy it but for anyone else including fans of the genre what a bore the ancient plot is reminiscent of return of the dragon and this film is just as inept but <UNK> is no bruce lee so enter the ninja is an even worse film until now this is the second the offensive comedy bachelor party was the first film i gave 1 10 to
<START> ok no one will confuse this with citizen kane but you've got to love a movie where the women are always topless there are a few <UNK> and some kinky sex as well on the other hand i hope they didn't the guy who wrote the dialogue here's a prime example after one of the captive girls dies br br this is terrible it reminds me of the day <UNK> died a relative no my favorite cow i guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile i will say that it took me three <UNK> to make it through this fine work of art never a good sign i guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same i hope the folks waiting to rent it next didn't get too <UNK> don't worry folks it's on it's way
<START> <UNK> 100 this is not to be confused with the decent <UNK> this film is a very low budget and cheap rip off of that movie this one is so bad it actually does have some entertainment value on that level there are numerous <UNK> i think laugh out loud scenes i wasn't expecting much from the film and it was actually worse than i had imagined it would be br br it's a cliché ridden and predictable direct to video mess fortunately it doesn't take itself too seriously the acting as expected is not quite oscar caliber the special effects are poor worse than i would have thought they would be poorly edited and the score is <UNK>
<START> this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b its title promises far more than the film delivers it's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality the people are <UNK> even the obligatory flamboyant type the lead kevin <UNK> overacts <UNK> as there's a reason for him to act at all simon <UNK> playing a horny straight is always worth watching and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie however the rubbish about his men's group <UNK> or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order they seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to <UNK> the setting and non stop <UNK> the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip don't worry about <UNK> the tape so you can get a <UNK> let the thing run you won't miss anything hugo <UNK> character is superfluous he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all the outcome of that sequence isn't explained and <UNK> real estate <UNK> have nothing to do with the story the movie is a total disappointment at the end because there is no resolution the thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits this is an <UNK> with no structure
<START> some people like to tell you that deep space 9 is the best of all the star trek shows because it <UNK> character development and continuity and features a more complex background and ongoing plots in some ways this makes it more satisfying but in many ways the show fails entirely br br the series starts out as a soap opera on a space station with two entire seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with banal subplots about the characters the characters are a good bunch and most of the actors are decent but i think the writers tried too hard to make them normal by normal they actually mean ordinary and tedious br br at the end of season two we are introduced to the <UNK> who hang around <UNK> for a while before finally going to war with the good guys in season five this is the main story arc of the show but it only takes up a <UNK> of the entire series we still get lame stand alone episodes heroes still get stranded on weird planets for forty five minutes and there's an awful lot of low brow comedy featuring the greedy goofy <UNK> a lot of episodes are merely dull and some are unwatchable br br the <UNK> main villains are bent on <UNK> <UNK> for the convenient reason that well they just don't like anyone the entire war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination <UNK> space battles appear with great <UNK> from season three <UNK> but these are carried out in <UNK> simplistic ways such as two huge of super advanced <UNK> flying right at each other and <UNK> away the writers of <UNK> including the talented ronald d moore later of battlestar galactica fame <UNK> up their monotonous show by starting a war but at heart it is still a <UNK> soap br br <UNK> remains a very frustrating experience the continuous story is too flat and obvious to be really gripping and the characters never truly develop in interesting ways <UNK> 5 and battlestar galactica both <UNK> the promise made by <UNK> and did everything much better for star trek stick with the original and the next generation
<START> <UNK> the murderous doll from child's play and 2 crappy sequels is dead but his ex girlfriend <UNK> jennifer <UNK> gets his remains and using voodoo for <UNK> <UNK> him then through circumstances too convoluted to get into she is killed and has her soul put into another doll together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple nick <UNK> <UNK> to take them to <UNK> coffin to get an <UNK> to make <UNK> and <UNK> real people again br br a lot better than it sounds after the last two sequels to child's play both of which were horrible i was expecting the worst but this actually was lots of fun the movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second seriously how could it and the lines and situations are actually quite funny also there are a few very gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving the movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror movie a gay best friend gordon michael who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which has his shirt off just to show his muscular body john ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriff br br the acting is good is young very handsome and likable <UNK> doesn't have much to do but pulls it off and brad <UNK> the voice of <UNK> and <UNK> are hilarious as the murderous dolls my favorite part is when the dolls have sex don't ask and she asks for a rubber and he responds but i'm made of rubber the special effects are good no lousy cgi here and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way well worth seeing i give it a 9
<START> what do you do with all the material that does not make the final edit of a film you might keep it aside in case a director's cut or extended version is released one day you might sell some it as stock footage to be used in a part of another film you might just bin it or you might collect it <UNK> more and more from each film you make and then use it to make another film <UNK> <UNK> or any sense throw a very primitive <UNK> of a narrative into it and line up a number opportunities <UNK> excuses to <UNK> in your celluloid cast offs excuse the <UNK> nonsensical nature of the plot by framing it all in the mind of a horror film director and you've got yourself an awful film this can all be done with just a few days shooting and idiots like me will waste two hours of their life watching it and then come on here and try to warn others away the whole chain of events is one big waste of time
<START> what gives this movie its personality is the knowledge in the end that it is all true while it is a compelling and humorous documentary that does border on <UNK> in some parts are they staged or is it really happening <UNK> it does seem to get a bit long towards the end br br this movie is funny in places it needs to be and flows relatively well reminiscent of christopher <UNK> movies if you liked those or adaptation then i recommend you keep a look out for this one br br b
<START> big spoilers flesh feast of 1970 is a more than <UNK> conclusion to the great <UNK> <UNK> career this has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker and rightly so i must say as a huge fan of low budget horror exploitation especially from the 70s i nonetheless chose to watch this mainly due to the cool camp looking picture on this site but after watching it i had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film the picture here on this site is the cover of a dvd collection entitled <UNK> containing four films including sergio <UNK> mountain of the cannibal god and i eat your skin what the collection does not include however is this boring turkey flesh feast is not only camp and ridiculous but mostly quite tedious which is even more pathetic regarding that the film is only 70 minutes long also don't get fooled by the title the film is not gory at all yet it is watchable if only for its <UNK> and especially the extremely stupid but therefore somewhat entertaining ending the film follows a ridiculous plot about dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lake an ingenious female scientist who can somehow <UNK> youth with the help of flesh eating <UNK> don't ask how a bunch of criminals or terrorists or whatever who are paid by a radical political group <UNK> the doctor to <UNK> the youth of a <UNK> commander after an endless hour of nonsensical drivel it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually hitler himself it was quite obvious before but i still had to burst out laughing because the film's finale was so unbelievably silly and unintentionally hilarious this is a film that is very <UNK> as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like <UNK> lake except for lake the performances are ridiculously bad even for a zero budget production like this bad performances however are something i can easily forgive in films like this one what i can not forgive though is extreme boredom the final five minutes make this watchable for hardcore fans of camp stuff but i would still recommend to skip it
<START> here's a couple of <UNK> out of an <UNK> i wrote for university about br br the book of revelation is an erotic thriller about sex power and a talented <UNK> struggle to regain his sense of self after being unfortunately raped by three <UNK> women the three women that <UNK> him all have distinctive marks on the bodies one has a giant birth mark on her <UNK> another has a <UNK> <UNK> on her lower stomach and the ring leader has a small circle on her breast so he lives his new life in search of these <UNK> and to find them on these intimate places he does what any sane man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery he has sex with them an hour and ten minutes into the film and you feel like he has almost had a piece of every woman in melbourne br br the film is a giant <UNK> of pretentious celluloid it is like <UNK> from every frame at only one point towards the films final climax does give a scene the same energy and strength as her debut feature head on had in <UNK> as like many films <UNK> by the government bodies the film takes it self way to seriously the script and its execution appear to be <UNK> rather then gifts and unfortunately for the talented <UNK> their brilliant performances particularly tom long as the <UNK> protagonist are stuck within the confines of a pompous wan k fest
<START> rugged david <UNK> solid doug <UNK> and dr <UNK> perry a delightfully <UNK> peter cushing <UNK> their way into the <UNK> core in their <UNK> mole machine the duo discover an ancient <UNK> world populated by dangerous gigantic <UNK> and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil <UNK> <UNK> men director kevin <UNK> working from a <UNK> silly script by <UNK> <UNK> maintains a constant <UNK> pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness thereby giving this picture a certain <UNK> earnest quality that's amusing and endearing in equal measure the <UNK> hokey not so special effects are quite unintentionally funny the cheesy array of cut price creatures in particular are positively <UNK> <UNK> guys in obvious shoddy rubber suits <UNK> men equally <UNK> <UNK> savage ape man <UNK> and a hilariously ludicrous fire <UNK> frog thing who blows up real good one gut <UNK> highlight occurs when <UNK> mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant <UNK> another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur <UNK> a doll in its <UNK> jaws moreover we also get some rousing <UNK> <UNK> and an exciting climactic slave revolt it's a total treat to see cushing <UNK> ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely but enthusiastic arrow <UNK> action hero in the last third of the flick the ever <UNK> caroline <UNK> looks positively <UNK> as the <UNK> princess <UNK> plus there are nice supporting turns by grant as <UNK> warrior <UNK> and sean lynch as <UNK> coward mike neatly varied score <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> music and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stuff alan <UNK> crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the <UNK> inane proceedings a complete campy riot
<START> i was shocked to learn that jimmy <UNK> has left this show does anyone know why i regard james as one of the all time <UNK> and wasn't surprised he ended up on tv which can be better than the crap you see on the big screen the stories are slick and the camera faster than a <UNK> bullet <UNK> forget the rest of the cast james vanessa <UNK> <UNK> molly josh mitch also can anyone tell me why on earth there's a crap theme tune on the dvd sets but <UNK> <UNK> of a little less conversation is used on the initial nbc <UNK> does it not make sense to use a tune that you would associate with the gambling <UNK> of america for dvd releases
<START> having enjoyed neil <UNK> writing especially his collaboration with <UNK> in the dream hunters in the past i figured <UNK> to be a sure thing and was very disappointed the beginning live action section of the movie was intriguing enough the relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with and i loved the sets the <UNK> and <UNK> artwork the subsequent computer generated scenes however were excruciating the dialogue was awkward and pretentious the interaction between the live actors and the cgi horrifying events occurred for the <UNK> reasons and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed i only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie so i'm not exactly an authority but i strongly recommend that you don't watch any of it at all and stick with <UNK> strong written work
<START> i first watched this movie in <UNK> film festival back in 1994 it was so good i took couple of friends with me and went to see it again the same week the characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing it sure is a very powerful gay movie some scenes make you feel you're watching an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines i guess i'll put it in my vcr and watch it again tonight
<START> i kind of liked the film it's just that the characters run around with no real point to their <UNK> as i was saying poor goat the goat was while the guy was pretending to <UNK> on it i would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic not the one with the goat though jane <UNK> who played <UNK> only did this one film she was very nude throughout this crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their <UNK> places i almost forgot about the gay <UNK> couple who are also picked out for being <UNK> if you like crazy off the wall stuff then this is your film 3 10
<START> i thought this would be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity in it well there's no sexual content but as for being a fun comedy i only remember laughing a total three times during the green <UNK> the hilarity is centered around <UNK> and mental <UNK> which is just sick humor in a bad way br br i should have walked out of this film and i'm kicking myself because i didn't in fact i shouldn't have seen this movie in the first place the only good that came out of this film was was the fact that and his brother finally made <UNK> and put their ugly past behind them i advise any well meaning individual to steer clear of this gross out flick
<START> am i the only one to think that this is a bad movie br br i admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects but the way these <UNK> come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful br br miserable story the idea of a raped <UNK> that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny but what the writer made out of it is stupid br br bad acting the actors move like <UNK> they play and look like people who really try hard but completely fail to act br br bad fx especially the explosion of the van looks <UNK> cheap br br it is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his <UNK> changes over to such messy stuff
<START> i can pretend no knowledge of cinematography or mr <UNK> but i know <UNK> and i love her people in july my 14 year old son and i traveled to turkey in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great grandfather lived until the great <UNK> of <UNK> in <UNK> reading the summary of the film <UNK> from <UNK> i thought that perhaps i might learn something more about the forced <UNK> of modern <UNK> if i did not have a home in <UNK> had i not been to <UNK> 28 times in as many years were i not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in <UNK> and if i had never enjoyed the friendship of these <UNK> life <UNK> people i might have believed that this had something to do with modern <UNK> as a professor at a new jersey state college let me assure you that i am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film indeed my wife's uncle was murdered by the <UNK> during the communist grab for power my mother in law lived through the italian invasion and german <UNK> barely these characters on the screen speak greek they listen to greek music but who are they no they are not even vaguely greek of course they are not people at all but simply <UNK> they are that which the artist <UNK> when life does not entirely fit or is <UNK> to his perception of how it was or should have been all represent some aspect of post wwi <UNK> that greater outside forces <UNK> to a fate they didn't deserve as we <UNK> in the late 70's in america the revolution didn't happen for an <UNK> artist this is no joke it's in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment and it's all because the various powers <UNK> of guards in different colored uniforms didn't allow the generation after the <UNK> of <UNK> to follow the call of peace and freedom the music of <UNK> and his fellow musicians i e the movement the cause this dark surreal <UNK> <UNK> the true and heroic efforts of the greek people to sustain their lust for life through the <UNK> of the 20th century to achieve more than any of their <UNK> neighbors to have become so politically evolved and <UNK> integrated
<START> still haven't read a single dan brown book but i watched all his movies adaptations i won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same actually this one is a thriller a race against time filled with <UNK> br br the plot is very twisted imaginative and the cast is excellent i never been a great fan of hanks but he delivers well i noticed his <UNK> shirt the one <UNK> with blood because i search for one like this in vain the italian is a brilliant newcomer for me but i really <UNK> ewan <UNK> portrayal his inner faith and calm is really impressive br br i really like the debate between science and religion the action taking place in the <UNK> it felt like vacation at last i am not sure it helps to add new <UNK> into with all the gold and man presence displayed any one would ask what charity means and why women are so <UNK> of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie many years ago and just for kicks decided to rent it and watch it again the plot is a <UNK> copy from fright night i did like the hairy vampire and the bug eating driver otherwise it was not good at all
<START> i actually found out about rising via the imdb website i have a particular interest in <UNK> brazilian culture and films rising is one of those gems that gives a new meaning to human transformation beautifully documented and filmed by jeff <UNK> and matt its the story anderson <UNK> a former <UNK> de <UNK> drug <UNK> who after the deaths of family members and friends becomes a christ like malcolm x and <UNK> all rolled into one <UNK> formed a <UNK> cultural movement that uses <UNK> brazilian <UNK> <UNK> brazilian martial arts <UNK> and other to <UNK> the hopeless and most times angry youth into vibrant <UNK> caring community loving individuals br br a few years ago i remember going to a screening of city of god de <UNK> and walked out of the theatre completely <UNK> the images were grim yet stunning and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen i remember how hopeless some situations were in the <UNK> and how <UNK> the society was due to the <UNK> neglect how drug <UNK> was a way of life how indifferent the citizens of the <UNK> were because death was an every day <UNK> like city of god anderson <UNK> talks about how the people of the <UNK> were also <UNK> he talks about the police corruption and how the <UNK> were so by drugs and gangs that you couldn't visit family members in other <UNK> you had to meet in a neutral location unlike city of god anderson <UNK> movement provides <UNK> to the anger the <UNK> br br there was one part in the documentary where anderson in the spirit of a preacher approached some youth and asked them to join these jaded youth were so <UNK> by everyday survival and violence their role models were drug dealers and this is what they <UNK> to be anderson told then that drug dealers don't live very long there was <UNK> of course but five months later he was able to get some of the youth to join br br the visuals in rising are beyond amazing its clear to me that jeff <UNK> and matt are not only great story <UNK> but visual artist as well this is a must see documentary there are some really magical and <UNK> moments in this documentary i don't want to spoil them for you i want you see it for yourself please tell your friends <UNK> youth <UNK> family members about this wonderful film it will make you care about the world and our children br br i would give it eleven stars
<START> i rented this when it came out on video <UNK> in 1995 after <UNK> it again my idea about it hasn't changed much br br i was an adult then and i'm still an adult now lol br br the illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn't bother me this isn't a documentary it's a fantasy story where animals can talk br br while i didn't care for much of the songs i liked the one at the end of the picture where it's sang by barry <UNK> and another person br br some people seem to make an excuse for it's primitive animation by saying that cgi wasn't used often in animated features but let's not forget that the lion king was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before it br br but i think it's pretty fair to say that the <UNK> and the was made on the cheap while the lion king wasn't br br the high points for me in 1995 as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerous mostly underwater chase scenes br br i also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story but most of the time the story dragged on and was boring br br worth a look if you like animation but if you're an adult and not a risk taker go get another walt disney production instead of this
<START> it's just one of those films you're either love it or hate it my girlfriend and me loved it told my brother to rent it and he hated it said it was too flashy and <UNK> then again he only usually goes to see big action movies so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed there were some great new talent i'd never heard of the leads before anyway des brady the directors brother was especially good playing a right dick at the start i thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end i was really <UNK> for him a very surprising film with a whole lot of heart if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original in the uk
<START> well i fell for it i saw the box for this at the video store and <UNK> it for <UNK> which i'd heard was great in my own defense the titles are similar and they re did the cover art for the box so it looked almost identical anyway to sum it up they obviously re did the whole cover <UNK> <UNK> to capitalize on the buzz success of <UNK> i popped it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straight to video flicks and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie which sounded like elevator music and featured corny <UNK> clips from the movie <UNK> the main feature when i saw the first few minutes and maria <UNK> <UNK> showed up i knew i'd fallen for it don't get me wrong she's a talented actress but i knew she wasn't in <UNK> the movie i'd been under the false impression i was renting br br so apart from me feeling sort of cheated and mad at myself for not looking closer the movie was ok the plot involves belle a young latino woman who is the daughter of an ex champion boxer one of her close friends is a female boxer who and i could see all this coming <UNK> far ahead of time it was really a drag gets seriously injured during a match with a mean <UNK> named the terminator who resembles a female version of a bigger more <UNK> up <UNK> turner of course belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend she lives with her caring supportive yet protective dad her mother died of cancer when she was younger who just happens to be a cop her love interest also caring and supportive yet protective is also a cop who works with her dad hmmm they both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty wonder what's gonna happen she starts training and meets a sleazy manager who of course pretends to care about her but just wants to exploit her the actor they hired looks like a very low rent cary and is so young he barely manages to have a mustache his acting was also really really bad i'm not even going to go into the plot any further because anyone who has seen rocky or almost anyone knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end br br this was not a completely terrible movie most of the acting was ok and the lead actress was very good there were good strong female latino role models the final fight scene did get me sort of interested even though i knew everything that was going to happen long before it did the actress that played the terminator did a great job of being unlikeable enough that i really did want belle to kick her a and <UNK> for belle again although there were absolutely no surprises my favorite moment maybe the only moment where i wasn't mad at myself for renting the movie by mistake was when belle <UNK> her sleazy manager after he's shown his true colors yells at him and then turns away only to suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear showing that she is really the one in charge br br the dialogue was really really bad my main complaint one of their attempts to be witty was someone discussing boxing saying size doesn't matter and the female <UNK> <UNK> now where have i heard that before other lines that are supposed to have dramatic impact are the doctors told me i may never walk again come on you know you can trust me and your mother would have been so proud of you i could go on and on nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad soap operas or movies of the week br br maybe i'm being too mean the filmmakers did make an effort and i did sit through the whole thing <UNK> but only because there was nothing else to watch while i worked out you could do worse especially if you are looking for a movie with strong female characters but you could also do much much better
<START> daisy movie review by james <UNK> from com br br on paper daisy sounds like an asian film <UNK> dream come true directed by <UNK> affairs co <UNK> andrew <UNK> and starring everybody's favourite sassy girl popular korean actress <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately despite the talent involved and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in <UNK> the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment being a romantic drama which <UNK> in misery and self importance br br the plot follows young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a rather naive korean girl who lives in <UNK> spending her life working in her <UNK> <UNK> shop and doing <UNK> for tourists one day she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge one day she meets <UNK> woo lee also in holiday and public enemy who <UNK> to her is actually an <UNK> agent tracking asian criminals in the <UNK> br br with young assuming that <UNK> woo is responsible for the flowers the two fall very slowly into a <UNK> romantic relationship however it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually park <UNK> <UNK> woo sung from sad movie and <UNK> an assassin working for a chinese crime <UNK> inevitably the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life br br although daisy is ostensibly a love story it has the feel of a funeral with a slow <UNK> pace and a plot which <UNK> on the misery half of the film's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring <UNK> out of windows into the rain with the silence broken only by <UNK> of self <UNK> narration director <UNK> seems to be under the impression that the film is a <UNK> shakespearean tragedy rather than yet another gloomy hit man love story as such the proceedings have a rather pretentious air despite the fact that the plot is <UNK> predictable and based largely around glaring cliché borrowed <UNK> from the likes of <UNK> killer and john <UNK> classic the killer br br almost every aspect of the film is <UNK> with angst with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders and <UNK> <UNK> to do anything to pursue their romantic <UNK> park <UNK> in particular as the kind of overly emotional socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema is <UNK> ludicrous from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss <UNK> painting with young or his <UNK> for flower growing this <UNK> <UNK> does make the film's central romance somewhat hard to swallow and <UNK> attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence br br fans of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> should note that her character is far closer to her role in the <UNK> supernatural drama the <UNK> than my sassy girl or and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there her performance is certainly more subdued br br the film benefits from glossy production values and <UNK> makes good use of the <UNK> scenery playing on the contrast between the grey almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue <UNK> and <UNK> fields of the countryside unfortunately he tends to <UNK> slow motion for some of the emotional scenes which when coupled with some of the picture <UNK> visuals gives the film the feel at times of a <UNK> <UNK> there are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action though these are few and far between and whilst well staged seem to have been thrown in as an <UNK> and do little more than briefly raising the pulse br br despite its flaws daisy makes for engaging viewing and the story grips almost in spite of itself mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men young will end up with but to see who will lie dying in her arms the self indulgent melodrama works well enough to <UNK> all the right boxes for the genre and the film functions perfectly well as an <UNK> glossy <UNK> romance br br it is worth noting that the dvd features the director's cut of the film which for once <UNK> that it is <UNK> different from the theatrical version which not only adds 25 minutes but some of the scenes making the narrative less linear although this new version is perhaps too long it is surely superior as without these changes the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even <UNK> character development br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> director young screenplay cast woo sung <UNK>  park <UNK> sung lee  <UNK> woo david <UNK>  <UNK> ho <UNK> <UNK>  detective <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  young <UNK> <UNK>  <UNK> <UNK> ha
<START> i've seen <UNK> brown <UNK> friday foster <UNK> and black mama white mama of these this is pam <UNK> worst movie poor acting bad script boring action scenes there's just nothing there avoid this and rent friday foster <UNK> or <UNK> brown instead
<START> a rather mild horror movie if not for a couple of sex scenes it could easily have been a tv movie plot holes abound one example why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put <UNK> 200 years later cardboard acting characters doing things that anyone with an iq bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do br br it's got a few fun moments but overall it's a sub par film that managed to get roy <UNK> because his bills were due if you're looking for an extremely formulaic predictable film that might provide a few laughs it might be worth watching if not then this one's not for you
<START> aside from frank who played abraham <UNK> an appearance by <UNK> <UNK> and the last seconds of the movie there really wasn't anything particularly good about this film why it is currently rated 5 3 and <UNK> by some reviewers is beyond me the film is 99 <UNK> crap and exactly what i would have expected from director <UNK> gordon lewis in the 1960s and 70s lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films such as blood feast and monster a go go however in recent years he's been <UNK> the father of gore and he has many many fans fans who ignore the <UNK> of his work and only focus on how groundbreaking some of his films were but apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts at heart his films are pure crap and don't believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films this would be like putting a <UNK> elvis painting in the <UNK> br br the film is about a string of very grisly murders that happen to <UNK> when i say gruesome it's very bloody and sick for 1972 though by today's standards the special effects look amazingly lame so while some very <UNK> and cruel murders happen in the film i'd rather not explain them they are from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disregard for women at least they won't you because they were done so poorly it's obvious that in many cases they are cutting apart rubber dolls and <UNK> but to have them doing some of the sick acts even if unrealistic is pretty nasty and shows a lot of <UNK> br br the only hope in the film as the police are all idiots is a guy named abraham <UNK> whose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stock actor david from the early john waters films while his acting is bad he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest he could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film he ever made it was also odd that so many women wanted him especially because they just didn't seem like his type br br as for the rest of the folks in the film they are <UNK> and idiots who could not act in fact i was kind of hoping more would be killed they really had it coming none of their acting was the least bit believable and apparently the director never re shot a single scene as most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of the ones in ed <UNK> masterpiece plan 9 from outer space in fact for many of the women in the film the only <UNK> for their appearing in the film is that they be willing to take off their clothes now i know this will sound pretty mean but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug <UNK> who strip to get their next fix when these ladies take off their clothes men in the crowd give them money to put it back on wow <UNK> <UNK> should have said that in the film but considering <UNK> budgets these were probably the best actresses he could get br br overall a sleazy bucket of <UNK> that manages to be worse than most of the director's other films and that's saying a lot it's violent yet dumb anti women treating them like meat and things to be <UNK> and is thoroughly incompetent from start to finish
<START> films like this <UNK> me simply because they don't deserve the funding that <UNK> them to end up in my dvd player this movie is ambiguous in its jacket <UNK> and even more <UNK> in its casting choices why is ms song a romantic interest did they just want an asian woman in there or does her <UNK> wise character actually lend this message movie's story a fresh perspective one has very little to go on in approaching this film and even less as the story unfolds but a good hour into the proceedings i realized the dull casting is all the casting agent could <UNK> up the unconvincing character studies are the result of <UNK> brain fart and the story is <UNK> and plagued by <UNK> references to the <UNK> of capitalism <UNK> and getting ahead in the <UNK> world towards the end of this film just before i <UNK> off and missed the last two minutes i got the sense that <UNK> gone green is a product of connections in the world of film someone with very little talent knew someone with very little directorial skill knew someone with absolutely no marketing sense but plenty of <UNK> ego and out popped this dull and <UNK> attempt at <UNK> and humor with a conscience nonsense and this is what is most <UNK> how many infinitely better scripts were passed over in favor of this almost unwatchable tripe skip this film and feel good about yourself for doing so
<START> great acting is best rewarded by pairing with a melodramatic script which truly <UNK> the human spirit to all those <UNK> who <UNK> each and every day take heart your patience is <UNK> your and decency will evidence in ways you will never <UNK> this is your great story i do not believe you can watch through to the end without a <UNK> of <UNK> in that hardened eye or can you for me it would not be so the story is relentless the <UNK> denied his due will anyone speak up ah but you will need to see the show yourselves observe the <UNK> in his prime without the notice and the <UNK> would certainly expect and why does he continue so yes you must watch <UNK> performance for yourselves i can only wish it were still <UNK> to purchase then present to my friends as my evidence of respect for their faithful lives
<START> a mild mannered ny lawyer george segal is slowly going crazy he promised his father on his death bed that he would never send their <UNK> mother ruth gordon to a <UNK> home years later he's taking care of a <UNK> dangerous psychopath he meets a beautiful nurse <UNK> van and they fall in love but his mother keeps <UNK> her away segal is ready to kill her br br <UNK> this is a comedy i have nothing against sick black humor but come on there has to be some limits this movie goes out of its way to throw every tasteless sick joke it can think of and rub your face in it too bad none of the jokes are funny the jokes involve rape nudity public <UNK> <UNK> old people swearing and racism basically this is a movie that thinks it's clever by trying to shock people and thinking they'll laugh at it i was disgusted and didn't laugh once the movie is morbid disturbing and surprisingly dull the cast is the only thing that kept me watching segal and gordon were both wonderful in their roles gordon especially and van is pretty good also but the script is against them the only interesting thing not funny was a pointless courtroom scene with rob <UNK> jr and try to spot his then wife penny marshall as a <UNK> br br actually this movie could have been worse the original ending had segal getting into bed with his mother and pretending he's <UNK> that was thankfully changed br br a real lousy sick film bottom of the barrel i give it a 1
<START> julie andrews <UNK> <UNK> her own <UNK> two shoes image in this <UNK> musical comedy drama but if she approaches her role with <UNK> she's alone in doing so blake <UNK> film about a woman who is both music hall entertainer and german spy during wwi doesn't know what tone to aim for and rock hudson has the <UNK> task of playing romantic second <UNK> musicals had grown out of favor by 1970 and productions like star and this film really <UNK> <UNK> reputation leaving a lot of dead space in her <UNK> until the seed came along i've always thought julie andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady her strong voice could really command attention and she hits some low notes that can either be <UNK> or seductive husband director <UNK> seems to realize this but neither he nor julie can work up much energy within this scenario screenwriter william peter <UNK> isn't a good partner for <UNK> and neither man has his heart in this material <UNK> script offers andrews just one fabulous sequence a <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> for all viewers out there who have <UNK> john waters for creating a film like pink <UNK> just stop it's getting you nowhere has anyone ever cared to stop and think about the ambition and dedication mr waters possesses to gather your best friends up and to create a movie just to gross out thousands of viewers all over shows this man has a great deal of ambition inside himself just read his biography shock value it <UNK> the <UNK> he went through to get this film finished maybe it wasn't just the fact that john made this film to gross people out it was to prove that there can be something such as good bad taste
<START> i have to say is the only reason i even watched this film he is good however everything else about this film is so far below average that it's not worth the time and effort spent viewing this film br br this film has loads of technical aesthetic issues namely shot <UNK> framing camera movements within monologue sequences extremely bad editing probably due to the total lack of <UNK> in and between shots and overall terrible acting except for br br it was far too theatrical in acting and presentation to develop any sort of suspenseful moment in this film which is surprising because it's all about a bank robbery which should be at least somewhat exciting br br how does a film this bad get made and then released and then distributed br br kind of reminds me of a c film <UNK> <UNK> project probably not even that good though
<START> i thought that this movie might be a good spoof or at least a good independent comedy like friday instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder it wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad many great films have been made on a low budget it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp case in point for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking <UNK> put on their makeup and then answer a phone call you keep waiting for something to get story moving but it never comes the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying which wasn't interesting anyways if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when it's bad but it was all i could do to sit through 20 minutes it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didn't <UNK> the tape and left off about the same place i did the only reason i gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers
<START> ever have one of those <UNK> that seems to build up forever you gasp and you and you grab the nearest paper product in <UNK> for the world's greatest <UNK> <UNK> and then it <UNK> <UNK> was the cinematic equivalent of that lost <UNK> now i'm big on b movies and i always look the other way when a boom mike pops <UNK> or an actor speaks his or her lines with all the enthusiasm of <UNK> ford but this one really let me down the cover of the video for instance is the tag line of the whole movie using parts from murdered new york prostitutes dr <UNK> <UNK> his deceased <UNK> only to have her run amok in manhattan as a sort of with a bad attitude after an hour and a half of build up this fairly funny ten minutes seemed a little anti climactic
<START> i can't say that this movie deserves a ten because i would be lying i <UNK> this movie when i saw it though it carries the unique bond of a friendship between a teenager and a <UNK> although it doesn't display the <UNK> that jesse and willy had in free willy it provides an exciting movie that the whole family will enjoy if you love marine animals or if u love just a perfect family film this movie is suited for you <UNK> definitely shows us how adorable <UNK> are and they are playful and could easily be house pets if everyone had a big enough pool i love <UNK> and <UNK> so obviously this movie works for me i do think that the producers should have chosen another shark instead of the hammerhead to enhance the antagonist part in the story perhaps a great white <UNK> is magnificent so check it out
<START> tommy lee jones was the best and no one can play f call better than he not only was he the first and best he was the only person that could portray his grief and confusion it was a bad let down and i'm surprised i even made myself watch it i can even begin how how pitiful they made i understand he would be old by that time but everyone knows that he would never let that pull him down the first movie was the best and the only one that i'll ever watch i hope to god that no more directors plan on continuing or <UNK> the wonderful classic without tommy or <UNK> without them the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone including the director if you plan on making another <UNK> <UNK> movie of any kind take mine and <UNK> of others don't waste time continuing the movies is just <UNK> the first one into the ground thanks
<START> it's the best movie i have ever seen i just love them i watch it every day i have the episodes from the internet here in romania is being broadcast the 6 season i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season until now season 5 is my favorite one d i love it because logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite i have liked dean too but logan is best i would like to remain with christopher because he is beautiful this show is good for all ages and is worth to be seen i really want the dvd's but i think that here in romania will never appear because i think that they don't even know that they have fans here but no matter what i'll be watching it bye
<START> i'm not a fan of scratching but i really <UNK> this movie it gave me a real insight into a world i never had a clue existed and what else is a documentary for funny clever hip just like previous film hype about the <UNK> music scene
<START> dear friends i've never seen such a trash movie as night of the demons 1988 it seems that the director kevin <UNK> had the intention to copy classics like the evil dead by sam <UNK> 1978 or george a romero's return of the living dead from the same year the cinematography was lousy the movie was very dark so i had to turn the <UNK> control to the maximum indeed horror pictures have to be dark but not the way like night of the demons the entire movie was ridiculous no suspense worse actors except alvin <UNK> in the role of <UNK> and horrible make up effects an average vote of 5 stars for that movie i can't believe this perhaps the users were pleased about the tits <UNK> and <UNK> of the actresses they were indeed worth 5 stars regards hans <UNK>
<START> this film was adapted from the well known <UNK> on journey to the west where a monk with his three students seek out to find a long lost book with regards to the teaching of <UNK> br br though this movie is not as <UNK> as the previous films made according to the legend it did however managed to bring in romance and fun filled humorous scene br br this real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures one of his student the monkey god managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of a dragon locked up in that particular <UNK> br br the monk <UNK> in a small village where he found <UNK> <UNK> the so called ugly <UNK> daughter who fell in love over him at first sight though ugly she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him however a quest for <UNK> his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with <UNK> <UNK> following the monk problems <UNK> deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse br br the rest of the tale would be left at your own <UNK> but suffice to say this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book it is more for those who wants to seek out for a funny and light picture of what journey to the west and the love obstacles really mean br br towards the very end the whole summary could be described with only one word and that is love the monk went to show the heavenly gates the <UNK> palace and <UNK> himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers br br a wonderfully created and funny acts <UNK> those who buys this ticket there would be of course no regrets at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film
<START> mgm tried pairing up and coming young men with the divine one to give them exposure and try them out as leading men gable and garbo had chemistry in susan but it was a lousy film here in inspiration there is no chemistry whatsoever between garbo and robert <UNK> and the script is poor as well what were they thinking the modern fast talking wise crack <UNK> <UNK> and the long suffering garbo it is a tale like <UNK> young student falls for woman of the world and is <UNK> by learning of her past rejects her takes her back rejects her you get the picture garbo is completely believable as a top <UNK> <UNK> model and completely at home although bored with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent she finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own ironically he <UNK> to marry and keep her on the side so much for his pure moral <UNK> of earlier br br the scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens only <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> is able to <UNK> life into the proceedings with such lines as unfortunately weak women have strong <UNK> and <UNK> where is <UNK> <UNK> br br only for garbo fans
<START> it's not easy to find <UNK> kiss on vhs it's not available on dvd but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan <UNK> movie collection br br i can't understand how the talented mr <UNK> gets into these mediocre films <UNK> kiss boasts several wonderful actors an interesting plot and intriguing twists but its strange visual <UNK> and <UNK> editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses why did he <UNK> the detective he replaced there were times when i honestly couldn't tell if the director meant <UNK> kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof why else would he toss in a topless alien lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes that little surprise certainly made me <UNK> for the remote since my kids were playing nearby did he <UNK> <UNK> his two distinguished english actors alan <UNK> and emma thompson to use such awful new accents as an alan freak i confess that i still thought mr <UNK> was sexy in a <UNK> weary take him home and <UNK> him in sort of way br br <UNK> kiss isn't a great movie but it does have some intriguing moments but i don't recommend it unless you're trying to <UNK> yourself in alan <UNK>
<START> i love japanese movies having seen at least 100 200 so it's obvious i am not afraid of japanese films however sometimes there are japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to <UNK> they might be hits at home but abroad they just don't seem well normal it's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd <UNK> games such as dating or things that are accepted there that confuse non japanese this is probably the way others view things americans take for granted such as american football fried <UNK> bars and paris hilton well the king of strange japanese films that just don't seem right to americans might just be <UNK> now the style of animation isn't the issue it's different but nice enough no it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending that's what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this there was a <UNK> man who for no apparent reason had a tree growing out of his head it was little at first and he simply cut it away but again and again it grew back so he just decided to let it go and after a while people began living on his head under the <UNK> of the tree oddly while they were under the tree they were tiny but when they left they were full sized again then after finally getting sick of it all and <UNK> out the tree the man <UNK> himself in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was the end br br see i told you this was very very odd but not in a good way like <UNK> or happiness of the <UNK> just odd o d d odd and unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing i doubt if you'll feel bad to know that this oscar nominated film did not win frankly that makes me happy as i really don't want this film to <UNK> on such similar films the only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice but not spectacular animation br br this film made my brain hurt i hope that isn't a sign that i have a tree
<START> this film <UNK> along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen the writer obviously bought the <UNK> how to write a space disaster movie and followed it play by play in particular the <UNK> typical use of <UNK> talking to their loved ones from outer space putting on a brave show in the face of disaster has been done time and time again br br max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw 50 million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only <UNK> 50 thousand to learn that the film was nominated for a special visual effects emmy has me absolutely <UNK> <UNK> br br i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects br br and the plot holes are too numerous to mention but i will pick one out as an example now i'm no <UNK> expert but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the <UNK> <UNK> would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go <UNK> shaped with the program surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty nine year old who has not been in the control room before br br the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell he manages to make a good attempt at <UNK> something out of the train wreck that is this script br br i give this film 2 out of 10 with the above average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark
<START> tim <UNK> was the reason i wanted to see this film and while of course his appearance is always entertaining he's basically wasted in it the rest of the cast doesn't fare too well either in this remake of an early zombie movie that has extremely graphic effects that are totally unnecessary to quote a popular <UNK> sometimes less is more
<START> the women 2008 by diane english is sadly such a waste of talent with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bette midler <UNK> <UNK> whom i like and enjoy in everything i've seen them and meg ryan <UNK> <UNK> smith debra messing and eva <UNK> who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at how could the movie be boring predictable embarrassing sloppy and simply bad it was made by diane english who is known as the writer of the very successful tv show murphy brown and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script the movie has been a labor of love for english who had tried for many years to make it happen and i respect that i even found the scenes with the supporting players <UNK> carry fisher and bette in short but memorable cameos funny smart and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand sex and the city which was released few months ago i did not find sex and the city very good when i saw it but next to the women it was simply brilliant at least sex and the city <UNK> us the long and tasteless scene in the <UNK> delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her poor debra messing what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we the viewers together with her the movies like the women give the whole genre chick flicks a bad name it is nothing wrong with the genre but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and <UNK> about dealing with marriage <UNK> and proving yourself <UNK> these are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to why making movies with the lines dialogs and situations so clichéd predictable not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over br br after i saw the new movie i checked out from my local library the original the women and i truly enjoyed it the story was told much better 70 years ago and kept my interest all the way the old movie had a real star power
<START> its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines but ill give it a try just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did to watch this awful and boring movie br br i like patrick <UNK> he did a excellent performance in films like ghost dirty dancing point break north south tv series but in this movie <UNK> this movie is so the acting is awful the script sucks well i cant even find one good thing nothing absolutely nothing i was watching it with 2 other friends and we all agreed that this was one of the most boring films we had ever seen and the fact that it lasts for more then 3 hours which we didn't know when part 1 was over and it said to be continued we almost cried do we have to watch 90 minutes more of this movie br br its painful to see this movie at no time do you get the impression that the actors are russians the action scenes are extremely bad the only good scene is when the truck explodes in the beginning of the movie the rest is crap go clean your toilet instead of watching this movie and don't come running crying if you do see this movie you were pre warned personally i would recommend patrick <UNK> to call his agent and have them recall this movie its that bad
<START> the most striking feature about this well acted film is the almost surreal br br images of the era and time it was shot it i could sense the time and moments were stark and very real even the language was so well chosen it's all too often when <UNK> of today's world are <UNK> used in movies about br br another time and place
<START> the final installment in the karate kid series is predictable poorly acted and so bad it borders on the enjoyable but not quite it's just bad in this installment ralph <UNK> karate kid is absent already having been in one too many of the episodes the new kid played by <UNK> <UNK> is the teenage <UNK> of one of mr wwii buddies her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is <UNK> trying to raise this young <UNK> in steps mr to set things right true to formula there is a group of neo fascist bullies called the <UNK> troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move called the praying <UNK> as i said before this movie is a mess and should be avoided
<START> when i saw 6 0 on imdb i was rather impressed and excited to watch this movie as a 6 for a horror movie should be rather entertaining at first i thought it was going to be some disturbing unseen evil force having not read the book to <UNK> the audience but it turns out to be something rather mundane killer plants regardless i am a rather open minded individual when it comes to movies so i thought perhaps the movie would bring some kind of breakthrough spin on <UNK> <UNK> br br unfortunately it failed to meet my expectations due to the excessive amounts of cliché and lack of any originality to top it off the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity unless the movie is intentionally a bad b rated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of badness no movie should ever ever ever have a main character <UNK> you if one expects the audience to care about the character such roles should be reserved for secondary characters characters were undeveloped the monsters plants in this case left unexplained and clichés were dripping all over br br the only thing that is mildly effective are some of the bloody gory scenes although the gore <UNK> in comparison with movies like high tension or <UNK> the killer consistently failed logic such as why would a character not watching the top of a rope during a second attempt at <UNK> into the ruins when it just <UNK> and almost killed someone even if minor adds up and just continues to anger the audience the movie could've saved itself by using characters or some kind of story device to or redeem idiot characters who just did something stupid or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes but to continue to allow idiocy to <UNK> will certainly cause the audience to abandon all care for the character in turn taking away the terror of the movie br br overall this is a poorly done movie an example of a well done movie involving pretty twenty <UNK> getting killed is the texas chainsaw massacre remake and the prequel too that certainly <UNK> fear and had much less character logic flaws in summary if you have a lot of time to kill go watch it if there's nothing else otherwise don't waste your time with this sub par flick and go see something actually scary and highly satisfying like the hills have eyes remake
<START> man of the year tells the story of tom <UNK> robin williams a political comedian like jon stewart or stephen <UNK> who has his own television show on his show he talks about all sorts of things but his main focus are political issues which he is very <UNK> about one day on his show a fan from the audience raises the idea that <UNK> should run for president of the united states after that episode aired millions <UNK> to the web to create various and voice their opinions on why <UNK> would make a great candidate for the president for the united states a few weeks later <UNK> decides to run for president and low and behold wins the election everything seems to be going as planned until a woman by the name of <UNK> green laura <UNK> shows up and starts some controversy regarding his position a funny yet serious political thriller br br man anyone walking into this film expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed i always wonder how some people are film <UNK> when i see how misleading their marketing <UNK> man of the year is a great example of bad and misleading marketing because everything from the poster to the trailer to the online <UNK> makes this movie look and feel like a comedy i would honestly have to say about 1 3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think i kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film <UNK> pretty serious issues in between its comedy routine br br but enough about marketing lets get down to the film itself br br i really liked man of the year even though i was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film one of the many things i will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward i really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and don't understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the <UNK> for not advertising this film right br br man of the year talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion as tom <UNK> speaks he is saying things that need to be said and isn't about candy <UNK> them i also think the whole political subplot while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing was very good the idea of voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic also the control big <UNK> have over voting also gets addressed br br as far as acting goes i think everyone involved did a good job robin williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing tom <UNK> some say that williams has <UNK> his welcome as a comedian but i personally still think he is funny and he's a good serious actor as well this is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and i think it works well also it's nice to see lewis black co star in a decent film again i like black when he appears on the daily show and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful this was a good movie for him because i think his political views fit in with the story that director barry <UNK> was trying to convey laura <UNK> is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly christopher walken and jeff goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them br br man of the year was written and directed by barry <UNK> the man who has brought us such films as rain man good morning vietnam and <UNK> the dog <UNK> does a fine job writing the film and directing it like i said i know a lot of critics didn't like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but i thought it fit in nicely it was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time barry <UNK> did a fine job with this film br br in the end don't go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you it does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama it's not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe i really liked the fact that this film that this film wasn't a typical hollywood film it tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me i like the fact that the film didn't really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical hollywood ending i was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it didn't end the way i thought which made me happy it's a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what's going to happen next i think its a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing
<START> not all movies are oscar worthy but let's face it sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression this one left me smiling and happy and i couldn't wait to hug my own son anyone who has had a pet no matter what type knows what it feels like to lose one i believe most people would identify with buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth bruce willis was great as the <UNK> turned nice guy and joey lauren adams was convincing as a good mother the little boy who played buddy had a <UNK> face and his sister and friend edgar played terrific <UNK> roles liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy thanks
<START> if you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film it fails at the first post by not being scary or funny it is a dull grey movie that i guess went straight to video hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth if you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch diary of the dead poor special effects school level script zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point this movie has nothing there is no worthy point that <UNK> <UNK> this is as thrilling and convincing as a <UNK> convention no sorry watching the <UNK> convention would be a better example of a zombie movie
<START> in this era when almost everything makes it on to dvd i'm expecting to see the my mother the car collection any day now this film has been unfairly neglected there are <UNK> stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other <UNK> that have received at least a <UNK> dvd treatment this one wasn't even released on vhs to my knowledge despite the talents involved in the making arthur <UNK> eli <UNK> anne jackson murray notable later for co writing <UNK> even dustin hoffman in his debut it's obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era all films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made this was released the same year as the <UNK> <UNK> another absurd masterpiece that film was finally released on dvd and has developed a cult following this film has many memorable bizarre goofy wacky moments sure it's painted in broad <UNK> and has silly go go music throughout but that's part of its charm it creates its own absurd universe if whoever is in charge of dvd production for columbia pictures releases i believe columbia released it takes <UNK> for new releases this gets my vote
<START> i must be getting old because i was <UNK> to this movie from the first time i saw it i'm watching it again right now on hbo it's a very simple film about 2 people that fall in love after they found out that there <UNK> were having an affair plot is very thin but the actors acted very well in this movie in the mix of <UNK> scott thomas running for <UNK> and harrison ford being an internal affairs cop these two meet under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love i love the soundtrack perfect fit one thing i can't figure out this movie had a budget of <UNK> million dollars were was it spent the plane crash or harrison ford's <UNK>
<START> the premise of this film is the only thing worthwhile it is very poorly made but the idea was clever if not entirely original it's a shame the other aspects of the film weren't better the acting is especially bad
<START> if you're looking for a movie that puts you to sleep then heart of darkness is the movie for you the book wasn't what i expected to it to be and the movie disappointed me even further the cast list was pitiful and the all around plot was pathetic and was not like the book except for a few scenes i understand that everyone has their own point of view as they read heart of darkness and they create their own movie in their head but they director cuts important scenes and adds pointless ones if there was someone in the movie who was supposed to be of a certain culture they should've used an actor that was of that culture there are actors from every where and i'm sure that they could've found better ones to fit the roles joseph conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if that's what you're looking for but the movie was cheap and pointless and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book should've done it if you want a movie that drags you into darkness then heart of darkness is the movie for you
<START> in spite of its high minded ambitions film must be seen as a failure it's one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist which i think is what was attempting it's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and <UNK> episodic despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location and a wonderful score the film never <UNK> the audience in too much is unintentionally funny the phony sound of dripping water in <UNK> quarters for example or the silent movie <UNK> by some of the actors or simply confusing why exactly does <UNK> want to leave the <UNK> the first time for the film to succeed as a coherent work
<START> <UNK> <UNK> gives us magnificent depth of atmosphere yes it's a but <UNK> artistic use of imagery makes it something more the actors often behave like players using the stylized <UNK> <UNK> and facial expressions of <UNK> opera all the actors in a scene play to the <UNK> <UNK> even when addressing each other they are like spirits of the past <UNK> with powerful clarity a story with <UNK> meaning for those in the present combined with close attention to scale and masterful cinematography <UNK> and out <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wang is a stunning tale told with great <UNK> in its own <UNK> that <UNK> completely
<START> finally other people who have actually seen this show it is the funniest anime i have ever seen but most people have even heard about it it is just hilarious <UNK> so <UNK> will continue to ride his <UNK> bike and maybe one day he will save the world or maybe <UNK> <UNK> just some classic bits in it <UNK> so he will ride onto the next city because he has no choice since his <UNK> are broken study study study ' and some of the lessons that he writes down in his little <UNK> <UNK> i had a very educational experience i tried to look backwards but unfortunately i was already looking that way it hurt todays lesson the human head cannot turn <UNK> degrees '
<START> man was this hard to watch it was not at all funny not well made and it had no point or plot to it whatsoever the acting was horrible it was not well made at all it looked like a bunch of kids my age were just <UNK> around and making a pointless movie it is by far the absolute worst broken lizard movie if you are a broken lizard movie like myself you will disappointed and bored to your death please skip this pointless movie about ugly guys looking for chicks you will not regret m advice by the way don't say you didn't find this review helpful just because you didn't agree with it thats stupid like this movie the only ok scene was when the main guy was playing <UNK> and got beat the crap out of i liked that cause i found his character pretty damn annoying
<START> i'd love to sit down and write an intelligent well thought out review however i feel i'd be spending more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did i live in los angeles and i'm sorry to say that the characters seemed just so much like <UNK> and overly ego <UNK> actors there was not one moment in the film when i could escape the feeling i was watching the drivel ridden conversation of unemployed actors at a <UNK> la coffee shop one of the worst indie films i've ever seem with so little to recommend it that hearing it won at sundance has effectively removed any prior interest i may have had in attending much less considering a sundance review to be meaningful watch at your own risk
<START> i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was <UNK> at best the scares were all gross outs not true scares br br i don't remember much of the plot and i think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember they didn't even use the hotel to it's <UNK> potential the <UNK> are fantastic and the hotel is <UNK> on a <UNK> at low tide you can walk almost 1 4 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks br br the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and i'm using that term <UNK> scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings
<START> don't be fooled this isn't yet another tired example of the girls from outer space pretending to be the french <UNK> team come to earth to collect as much <UNK> as possible genre though the synopsis may suggest otherwise this movie is a gem an absolute jewel that has <UNK> my life from the moment i laid eyes upon it hilarious <UNK> action packed and stunningly erotic <UNK> is a euro <UNK> tour de force a grossly underrated <UNK> classic br br stop everything you are doing and run out to rent or better yet buy this movie immediately
<START> the story and the characters really really needed work the world idea is kind of neat but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition or through the plot despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film it makes sense that you wouldn't use exposition since no one is new to this world and yet when matt <UNK> bill paxton and byron bob peck stray off course and get lost and get introduced to the wind <UNK> and the fat lazy rich people in the museum we don't get any real idea of who these people are or why we should care about any of them smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the characters live in the world simple things like <UNK> a drink at a bar or talking about something in the past these are the kind of things that make the film world memorable not endless shots of crappy planes and cheap cg effects of someone trying to do <UNK> in an br br if this is too difficult for you here's a little tip <UNK> down the multiple locations if <UNK> becoming disjointed because you're pulling up to often stay in one place for a little while and have the characters talk a little all the superfluous crap should be removed get rid of the entire wind <UNK> scene get rid of the <UNK> museum people get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story have the entire thing set on a big plane or something just get people talking about something we care about br br hey get rid of bill paxton have the film center around character and his relationship with the robot byron br br indeed the biggest problem of the film is that we don't care anything about anybody because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters we don't like matt well because he's played by bill paxton among other things he's a <UNK> who doesn't redeem himself enough except to let the <UNK> byron go and this action has even less meaning than most because of three key points br br 1 byron is a murderer 2 byron is <UNK> 3 byron can leave any time he damn well <UNK> br br we try to like byron because there's a kind of pathos there but it's largely undeveloped all we're left with is a whiny <UNK> eyed robot guy who's acting is subdued and wooden one moment and practically zany the next we don't know why or how he develops emotions but we do know for a fact that he's murdered someone we don't know why he murdered someone or the circumstances of this grisly event because it isn't developed we can't feel pity for him if we don't know the story all we know for a fact is that he murders people and he likes bill paxton br br we don't hate enough partly because he's played by good guy mark <UNK> since while gruff and ruthless doesn't do anything out of the ordinary for his character a post apocalyptic peace officer sure he kills <UNK> <UNK> and his team but they are drug dealers on their way to grow for heroin and they shoot at him first he doesn't kill anyone who doesn't get in the way or who does not try to physically harm him first that goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum he uses a of police brutality against a lazy <UNK> f murray abraham is wasted in this role and everyone else draws a gun on him br br i really don't understand what's the deal with kitty <UNK> partner after only an <UNK> 10 minutes with matt she's ready to switch sides despite her shouts of loyalty and despite <UNK> trash talking her and <UNK> her out if that's love then i'll choose hate any day br br really <UNK> character is about as lovable as simon in true lies or <UNK> hudson from aliens does anyone fall for him in these movies no why because he's a loud mouthed idiot and a loser why put him at the <UNK> of this film
<START> this <UNK> southern gothic has a few decent moments but is too often spoiled by a <UNK> director <UNK> cliché upon cliché and a star who apparently decided to take it upon himself to turn the picture into his personal showcase rather than allowing writer director <UNK> to update <UNK> or williams as a sort of contemporary midnight cowboy meets <UNK> <UNK> br br close your eyes listen to the exaggerated southern accents and try to decide if you're witnessing a feature film or an acting class full of eager amateurs br br johansson is for once tolerable i e less <UNK> than usual though by no means good is decent though a little too pretty boy cute to be believed and travolta <UNK> the scenery as never before with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint his performance might have been really touching as it is he and almost everyone else is too unlikable to ever move us past the point of boredom or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is perhaps best of all had her role been developed beyond a few lines she might have even found herself with a best supporting actress nomination br br <UNK> is almost saved by leonard cohen style <UNK> theme song decent production design and locations and <UNK> reference to literary works which has earned the otherwise standard screenplay reviews such as poetic also helpful are a few old pros in the cast like sonny <UNK> and perhaps most importantly soderbergh cameraman elliot davis whose fine work will no doubt be credited to the first time director who ten or twenty years from now may actually learn how to direct br br but probably not
<START> 1956 was the 20th <UNK> of the communist party and the soviet <UNK> made a speech <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> and the <UNK> labor systems revealing information that was previously forbidden <UNK> revealing horrible new truths which opened the door for a new soviet cinema led by <UNK> once head of film production this film features a red army that is not <UNK> in fact they are <UNK> in a <UNK> mode with many people dying including the hero in a film set after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the german invasion of russia when germany introduced the <UNK> plan a <UNK> invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate <UNK> of the and very nearly succeeded actually getting within 20 miles of <UNK> in what was a red army wipe out a <UNK> of human <UNK> 15 to 20 million russians died or 20 of the entire population historically this was a moment of great trauma and suffering a psychological shock to the russian people but the red army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately <UNK> br br during the war <UNK> used the war genre in films for obvious <UNK> <UNK> introducing female <UNK> who were ultra patriotic and strong and idealistic suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic then russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers <UNK> eliminated the mass hero of the <UNK> and replaced it with an individual bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy an obvious reference to <UNK> himself who was always portrayed in film as a bold wise and <UNK> leader but changed this depiction as the <UNK> are flying was made after death causing a political <UNK> and creating a worldwide sensation winning the cannes film festival palm <UNK> as well as the best director and best actress <UNK> the west to soviet cinema for the first time since <UNK> <UNK> the terrible in the 40's br br this film featured brilliant breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer <UNK> using spectacular <UNK> and tracking shots images of wartime <UNK> <UNK> and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real another brilliant scene features the lead heroine <UNK> who hasn't heard from her lover boris in the 4 years at war so he is presumed dead but she continues to love him expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train instead she saves a 3 <UNK> old boy named boris who was about to be hit by a car another scene captures the death of boris on the battlefield who dies a senseless death and his thoughts spin and <UNK> in a beautiful montage of trees sky leaves all spinning in a <UNK> of his own thoughts and dreams including an imaginary wedding with <UNK> this film features the famous line you can dream when the war is over in the final sequence when the war is over the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets <UNK> learns boris died all are happy and excited with the <UNK> return but <UNK> is in despair passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of <UNK> and <UNK> revealing <UNK> white and gray floating in the sky br br the film was released in 1957 in russia and according to some reviews the silence in the theater was profound the wall between art and living life had fallen and tears <UNK> the doors br br br br
<START> like another reviewer i really wanted to like this movie i went with my father who was the biggest lover and <UNK> of classical music but neither of us could stand this movie i wouldn't even call it a movie a better description might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces as i recall the camera never even moved rather i just sat on a <UNK> for the entirety of each piece the only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the movie would cut to trees waving in the wind or little <UNK> at a beach i'm sure the director would have preferred to have used footage of some really big crashing waves but the best he could find were a few <UNK> high at some nearby lake and again using a <UNK> camera truly pathetic i can't imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than a five when we walked out my father and i were completely <UNK> as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie i don't know of of any good movies about bach the world really does need one but just because it doesn't exist is not a reason to see this one someone will make one someday until then just keep <UNK> <UNK>
<START> for the most part romance films were never my cup of tea but valley girl is one of the few romance films i not only could sit through but actually enjoy nicholas cage is great in his first role and deborah <UNK> is cute beyond belief there are some side stories that tend to become muddled but not enough to <UNK> this film
<START> first off what are some of you thinking this is the best movie i've seen in ages br br secondly i don't think of it as a british movie as it is set in <UNK> and has mainly irish actors <UNK> <UNK> o sullivan rita <UNK> <UNK> etc br br <UNK> i thought that <UNK> was excellent he was hilariously funny through out micheal caine seemed only to be there to get <UNK> context each character he took on he <UNK> br br <UNK> i thought was better than any other child actor i have seen she was believable as the smart kid and also as a kid and an adult yes i know that sounds strange but hey even she managed to <UNK> caine br br and <UNK> worked very well together and were very funny in the <UNK> scene br br was very funny in his <UNK>
<START> i found this movie to be okay br br on paper this movie has everything a person may want romance comedy drama a bank robbery a unique cast great music and storytelling br br in reality this movie ended up being mostly garbage and i'll tell you why br br a this is my biggest problem the editing this movie has by far the worst editing i've ever seen short of local car <UNK> commercials the editing could've been done better by a deaf patient <UNK> away at <UNK> with a a dead cat there are scenes where two characters are talking to each other and you can see their lips moving and the audio video isn't in sync because its clearly dubbed why was it dubbed i don't know its english dubbing english the voices were done in a studio elsewhere in certain scenes could they not find a boom <UNK> they're not expensive jesus even i own one and i don't make films br br b andrew performance lacked it really didn't seem like he wanted to be a part of this project and his acting was the equivalent of a skit performed by d a r e for <UNK> at least john showed some enthusiasm br br yes john is the only reason i rented this flick and its the only real reason worth watching he's did a good witty performance and he was the most three dimensional character dean <UNK> character was quite thin as was whats her face br br final word if you're a fan of john this is worth your time if not don't even bother the editing
<START> wow <UNK> i don't even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie i seriously don't know what the hell david <UNK> began smoking after making hard justice which in my opinion was quite a good movie after the american ninja features i hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after cyborg cop lucky i saw them on amazon for like 5 pounds each and i can safely say the following if i had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds i spent on total reality crisis and expect to die i would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted my god how the heck can anybody label these as movies and why do action martial arts actors fall <UNK> deep into the horse dung when they've like reached their peak i mean david <UNK> no oscar but his first movies were pretty entertaining tough cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent but i seriously would love to know what went through this guy's head after making hard justice his final 3 movies have to frankly be the worst i have ever had to sit through as i mentioned before i'd love to get my money back on the 3 dvds i bought crisis was the epitome of <UNK> total reality was harsh but this expect to die is just utter nonsense i bet the director was either mega stoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every david <UNK> fan who would sit through this heap of crap the plot circles around a doctor <UNK> who develops some type of virtual reality game in which he's just killing different people off one by one sorry but i just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hair do glasses and gray <UNK> and doing absolutely no physical fighting whatsoever frankly his best asset the film is even worse than any of those saturday afternoon b movies because the acting is laughable the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie well what can i say the actors look like they're training with their gym buddy we get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily a french hairy version of van damme who just can't fight act or speak to save his freaking life and <UNK> the supposed protagonist playing the evil doctor who i was really happy for when he stopped making this type of <UNK> rubbish i even <UNK> he didn't throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him for a b actor i must admit i really liked this guy his style <UNK> fighting skills but i'm really really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because i honestly wouldn't have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of pee taking material like this one avoid at all costs even if you're family of david <UNK> you'll be glad you did word
<START> if you liked this movie be sure to check out others directed by you are in for a treat this is unfortunately not his best but still million times better than an average movie from the mainstream cinema it explores relationships especially the abusive ones has some powerful as well as sweet moments and great acting some plot inconsistencies clichés and hollow moments spoil the overall effect to the previous reviewer and his comments on the czech psyche an interesting approach but i do not see this movie becoming a czech blockbuster those folks are rather spoiled by their movie makers check out also stuff by <UNK> and this one <UNK> a bit behind
<START> while <UNK> and amusing for gay audiences frank <UNK> film in and out about a <UNK> gay teacher who has been on national television by a former student has been <UNK> and to appeal to the larger and more <UNK> straight viewers that the bird cage although audiences likely <UNK> themselves on the back for being <UNK> and liberal enough to see the film the movie revolves around kevin <UNK> howard <UNK> who is a grossly stereotyped gay man the movie <UNK> that a tendency to dance to disco music <UNK> in barbra streisand movies and dress well <UNK> one's sexual <UNK> like <UNK> eye the film actually takes a <UNK> slap at straight men and stereotypes them as <UNK> dim witted and lacking in taste and culture ok so in and out is only a comedy but even comedies send messages that can hurt br br unfortunately at the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pathetic character howard is middle aged deeply <UNK> or in self denial and evidently has never had a sex life a three year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of <UNK> long talks and watching funny lady fortunately joan cusack plays <UNK> intended emily <UNK> and she steals the show throughout most of the film's funniest moments belong to her although <UNK> attempts to resist dancing during an <UNK> tape on macho behavior are hilarious he is a gifted physical performer but the film gives him only few moments to shine matt dillon also stands out as the student turned actor and the clip from his oscar nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical however despite the movie's gay theme there is no boy meets boy romance and only one male to male kiss and that <UNK> is about as erotic as the one between michael and <UNK> <UNK> in godfather ii br br although well <UNK> in and out fails to address the <UNK> and prejudices that it illustrates howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and <UNK> yet little outrage is expressed most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about <UNK> self realization which seems to take place overnight and his abrupt and <UNK> <UNK> not surprisingly <UNK> parents <UNK> portrayed by debbie reynolds and <UNK> <UNK> and his students rise to support him however the <UNK> finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to howard <UNK> in the film the movie would have been more refreshing if it had <UNK> around a gay man who dressed like a <UNK> was a <UNK> fan of football drove a station <UNK> listened to country music and lived on fast food despite some good performances and funny situations in and out <UNK> stereotypes and whether they be positive or negative stereotypes should be <UNK> to the <UNK> of social history
<START> throw <UNK> from the train is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughs br br billy crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse danny <UNK> plays a man in one of <UNK> writing classes <UNK> ex wife is a <UNK> to put it nicely and crystal hates her <UNK> <UNK> this offers crystal a deal one night <UNK> will kill <UNK> wife if crystal kills <UNK> <UNK> of a mother crystal does of course refuse but later corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes and so as things play out we see what happens when you try to throw someone's <UNK> from a moving train br br this story is an interesting character study a story of evil greed revenge ego trust doing what's right but most of all corruption we see <UNK> white collar writer become ever <UNK> with events <UNK> around him and because of <UNK> constant <UNK> he says yes but we know deep down in his <UNK> he wanted to say yes and he's pleased that he said it to <UNK> br br this movie is a bit of a dark spoof on hitchcock's immortal film strangers on a train and it plays an homage to the film early on when there is a theater playing strangers on a train we see <UNK> watching the movie and a in his head pops on he gets an idea throw <UNK> from the train br br billy crystal gives another convincing and strangely comical performance as a <UNK> writer on the verge of collapse he has been so beaten down by everything around him that his inner emotions come out and he agrees to throw <UNK> <UNK> from the train br br danny <UNK> directed this film excellently he uses just the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and sickness everything is demented but not to an extreme like in some other dark comedies it has just the right touch of darkness that <UNK> through in the war of the <UNK> br br not only is throw <UNK> from the train a simple tale of corruption and morality but is also an interesting character study definitely worth catching on tv br br 3 5 5 stars br br john <UNK>
<START> this much anticipated dvd <UNK> of <UNK> visit to south america in 2002 is possibly the finest rock video ever set down on disc the picture and sound production values are amazing even more so as they constantly <UNK> the elements to bring this production off all the tracks you would expect from the rush <UNK> are here from tom <UNK> to the pass <UNK> <UNK> for the frankly brazilian crowd they actually to which is an <UNK> and gives you an indication of their <UNK> the first disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi angle set pieces la villa and the awesome drum solo plus a 30 minute documentary about the bands visit to brazil all in all this is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy
<START> i don't understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment the eye popping horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be <UNK> me and my girlfriend just watched it together and i'm not sure we'll ever be able to have sex again i'm not sure what was worse the <UNK> unattractive cast their <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> attempts at humor the <UNK> noises that claimed to be songs br br no i know what was worst of all the girls in the green <UNK> with green <UNK> alice to dry her off then <UNK> in broken <UNK> speech that they <UNK> milk from her breasts that was the worst br br also what was with the <UNK> and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's <UNK> why are all the male actors gay why does <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> in the air and pretend that it's his penis why did my eyes have to see this there are no words
<START> this movie is one of the worst remakes i have ever seen in my life the acting is laughable and corman has not improved his <UNK> any since 1978 90 of the special effects are lifted from <UNK> 1978 up from the depths 1979 and <UNK> from the deep 1979 it makes <UNK> ii the <UNK> look like it belongs on the american film <UNK> list
<START> i think it is very interesting this movie is called a thriller it is anything but thrilling br br most of the time you hear piano sounds then you hear piano sounds then some people talk about facts which do not concern anybody br br then again piano sounds br br to be honest this movie was the reason for me to register at imdb because i think this movie is one of those which <UNK> has to be warned of br br spoiler by the way the most action like part happens when a can of hot chocolate is <UNK> br br also very interesting the actors yes the quotes are intentional as you can think because they do not act they play piano and do <UNK> but it's not acting they do br br i think before this movie i never left a cinema and felt angry really this film made me angry angry for the time and money i spent on it
<START> well where do we start there was a lot of potential for this film with such big stars playing a role but the whole story was ruined by a horrific plot this movie did not pan out to be what i would expect the good guy makes it out alive i mean co <UNK> nobody wants the good guy to be successful the ending was cringe worthy and very cliché no thought what so ever you got the plot all wrong the bad guys are meant to come out successful br br if you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time spend it doing something else this movie was the epitome of crap i really think the actors did this movie for some quick vegas cash no doubt about it save your money watch a better movie
<START> some of the secondary actors try really hard and camera shots in the desert are quite lovely otherwise this film is horrible br br william <UNK> character harvey is an amateur screenwriter he's also a psychopath a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are <UNK> harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie even if that means taking a film crew hostage do amateur screenwriters <UNK> maybe they do br br the film's setup is way too long we don't get to the point of the story until well into the second half the first half <UNK> and among <UNK> characters br br shoot or be shot is <UNK> as a comedy but i found it totally not funny dialogue contains no subtext none of the characters are believable as real people they're all stick figures that perform action in a way that resembles cartoon characters indeed the film is basically a cartoon for adults silly inane br br i can understand why some actors are in this film they need the money or the exposure but what are <UNK> shatner and harry <UNK> doing here maybe shatner wants more comedy roles is this the best he can do is <UNK> that desperate for money he used to be a respected actor what happened br br even though the story is supposed to be a satire it comes across more as a put down of amateur screenwriters maybe that wasn't the intent but that's certainly how the film can be interpreted as such the script was very very poorly written
<START> i just witnessed a movie that by all rights should have been fodder for a second rate <UNK> on lifetime but trust the irish to keep it from being anything but <UNK> the set up all but screams here's a message concerning what's truly important in life but the execution was way into the let's see just what we can get away with here br br it helps to have two fantastic actors in the leads james <UNK> as <UNK> and stephen robertson as michael while <UNK> is offered up as the near <UNK> one never mind the language and attitude he's the life force in this piece and could easily have been <UNK> in his ultimately caring attitude <UNK> keeps him sharp enough to keep him from being too sweet but the revelation is stephen robertson as michael not since <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in gilbert <UNK> has anyone so perfectly captured a person with an <UNK> that i began to believe he really was an actor with cerebral <UNK> and his eyes my god he can rip you apart with them br br this movie is to <UNK> <UNK> f <UNK> amazing go see it take a box of <UNK> and enjoy every well earned tear and laugh
<START> this movie could have been summed up in about 10 minutes i don't know what everyone else was smoking calling this a <UNK> film i feel that a couple hours of my life were stolen from me and i want them back i would put this in the category of a battlefield earth yes folks it is that bad you would do just as well to watch a two minute clip of this movie over and over it would have the same effect do not waste your time
<START> my poor tank girl they ignored everything great about you why does it have as little to do with the comics as possible i would have loved a movie that followed the plot or at least had the characters right br br why was tank girl american she's <UNK> <UNK> and she's not living in a post apocalyptic war zone either she lives in the <UNK> with like a savage she does it because she wants to live that way not because she has to because malcolm <UNK> is acting the <UNK> and <UNK> she looking after those kids the only children in the comics end up violently being <UNK> by her it's terrible that they made her into a lame mother figure br br and my poor jet girl and sub girl in the comics jet is a sarcastic <UNK> and sub girl is another sarcastic <UNK> with a weird sense of humour in the movie jet is this <UNK> little thing and sub is this <UNK> middle aged <UNK> and doesn't look or act anything like what he's meant to be either though maybe hot <UNK> human love was too much for the usa box office the humour was so lame too whatever happened to all the stuff about the <UNK> and that brilliant <UNK> they used all the time what sort of line is will this take long i don't wanna miss <UNK> even <UNK> for tiny children can come up with better material than that
<START> having known and loved this book since i was eleven i was terrified to see it coming up as a movie what if they'd made a dreadful mess of it in the event i <UNK> have worried at all everyone was very well cast and the acting is terrific it followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the scene in the prison which to me added nothing at all however it really is the most beautiful love story and i'm so glad i it so i can watch it again and again my only <UNK> is why didn't they give a green <UNK> made him such a <UNK> man' such a simple thing when they went to so much trouble for everything else if you get the chance see this it is excellent
<START> i hadn't heard of soap girl but i saw a poster with a five star review from film threat outside the theater so i figured how bad could it be well i soon found out my god this film was awful the most wooden acting i have ever seen outside of a porn flick absolutely <UNK> dialogue i just can't understand how this was made and why anyone agreed to be a part of it and i find it completely <UNK> that this was actually being shown in a theater and money was being charged to see it how did this happen and most importantly what the was the guy from film threat thinking
<START> i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie other than the mother being a complete moron on a few occasions and the youngest daughter being idiotic enough to go out at night into woods that scared her in the daytime this movie was pretty good had the director had the sense to treat us as if we had brains maybe he'd have given us a movie where the people didn't have to behave <UNK> but still manage to get into danger it worked for the <UNK> and the fellow in the trailer but apparently the teenagers and the mother needed to be idiots for the director to get closure in ending this film br br atmosphere was great scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared the crap out of me i live in a <UNK> area so taking out the trash will creep me out for quite a while the movie works for me accept for what i already mentioned raise the mom's iq a bit and i'd give it a ten
<START> finally a true horror movie this is the first time in years that i had to cover my eyes i am a horror buff and i recommend this movie but it is quite gory i am not a big wrestling fan but kane really pulled the whole monster thing off i have to admit that i didn't want to see this movie my 17 year old dragged me to it but am very glad i did during and after the movie i was looking over my shoulder i have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough i think that is why this movie is getting some good reviews it is a refreshing change and takes you back to the texas chainsaw first one michael myers and jason and no cgi crap
<START> after all these years of solving crimes you would've expected criminals to know that they can't afford making mistakes with him especially not with regards to talking much this time br br columbo goes to college and actually explains his entire technique but for some reason the murderer still doesn't pay enough attention however this still creates wonderful scenes and delightful dialogues
<START> i was really surprised to see that unlike most documentaries this was written directed and produced by a film critic richard most of the times i know of where film critics had major involvement in films the films turns out to be bombs rex reed starring in myra <UNK> and roger ebert writing beyond the valley of the dolls are prime examples however in this case the <UNK> powers are used for good and not evil and the results are better though this isn't saying much as the films i just mentioned are among the worst films ever made br br as for the documentary it's narrated by clint eastwood a pretty good choice and manages to discuss his long career from his silent days until his death in the early 1960s the only <UNK> and they are slight are that the film is awfully short as are most film documentaries and there is very little about gary cooper as a human being you really don't learn all that much about his life however as a nice <UNK> of his films it works very well
<START> <UNK> look in the is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that is one of horrors real underground stars and imho is vastly <UNK> some proper recognition is his <UNK> masterpiece this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the viewer <UNK> into such an odd disjointed claustrophobic world of <UNK> insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on it succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty just plain <UNK> for world is this mad <UNK> <UNK> prison cell of <UNK> <UNK> and all shades of mental illness and he uses his low budget palette to wrap his <UNK> <UNK> around you like a bad memory there is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing in a word classic also if you watch first then you will have some idea of the insane <UNK> style that marks other films in summary they really don't come any more <UNK> than this well actually they do track down <UNK> my grave mad genius accept no substitute
<START> i remember this movie with feelings of sheer agony more than half of the film is commercials no really the slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes and almost is the end result is a love story of predictable schlock all obviously thrown together in a <UNK> commercial attempt to <UNK> a few more bucks from the contemporary debbie <UNK> hit yep that's how fast it was produced the song that inspired it was still big on the <UNK> when the film was released br br despite decades of seeing bad movies this one still <UNK> me for its <UNK> no holds <UNK> <UNK> jump into the most tedious absurd and <UNK> cinematic badness it truly deserves to be on the imdb list of the 100 worst of all time and has never left the top 3 on my personal worst list br br enjoy it for the sheer <UNK> thrill
<START> this is such a beautiful movie not only does it portray war it also has friendship love the life of is filled with sadness every aspect of his life fell apart i can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrifice br br i see a slight similarity to <UNK> <UNK> which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman however this film is much better made because this does not portray the woman to be <UNK> easy going the friendship between the two men is also much more convincing well built up i definitely recommend this movie to all people
<START> jack frost 2 the worst horror film i have ever seen why 1 the premise is well beyond ridiculous 2 the damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on 3 it escapes after being completely <UNK> in anti freeze first film 4 get this it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a <UNK> island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film 5 killer <UNK> i have yet to be drunk enough to see ginger dead man so as of the writing of this jack frost 2 hold the distinction of being the stupidest horror film ever even <UNK> the of it's predecessor if you can believe that
<START> ms <UNK> the maker of mr mrs <UNK> directs this movie about a young girl's struggle to cope with her <UNK> condition br br <UNK> <UNK> has been an <UNK> kid ever since childhood and has shown signs of <UNK> no one knows why the <UNK> tendency however slips out of control when the job assignment takes her to <UNK> <UNK> where she's raped by some political <UNK> the resulting trauma also leads to episodes of manic <UNK> <UNK> in addition to her <UNK> she <UNK> out of control over the years <UNK> getting worse and sinking deeper into her private <UNK> br br the <UNK> of an divorced elder sister and how her <UNK> ways make an already bad situation worse is <UNK> of what a fine line there is between <UNK> and seemingly normal ms <UNK> also makes an excellent commentary on the social alienation of such individuals social <UNK> is standard therapy along with all the deadly mind <UNK> drugs but what about the poor and the <UNK> <UNK> always left to <UNK> for themselves and usually fall by the <UNK> br br the romantic connection between dr <UNK> and <UNK> was unnecessary also the <UNK> scene where dr <UNK> explains to <UNK> how real their world really is to them was redundant <UNK> should already know all that the english dialog is a bit awkward at times though the acting <UNK> for that <UNK> and <UNK> prove that their reputation is every bit worth it <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> play their limited roles very well br br extensive research seems to have been done about this illness its very evident but its not clear if can <UNK> with <UNK> in the same patient side by side also in the early part dr <UNK> <UNK> e c t shock therapy while the fact that it doesn't work for <UNK> only for extreme with <UNK> <UNK> and other forms of <UNK> disorder br br the ending of the remarkable story is suggestive of an unknown solution maybe no solution the movie could have ended on a <UNK> note since worldwide the mentally ill can and do lead balanced and <UNK> if not very fulfilling lives under good medical care br br nonetheless its an excellent film made with extreme sensitivity to the subject hats off to ms <UNK> no one in india could've done it better
<START> in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash i've found a number of things to be more useful to <UNK> my time to such as taking off my <UNK> with <UNK> br br the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in <UNK> <UNK> commercials do people won't really pay to see either the <UNK> you earn won't be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air time br br the first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids bug you about letting them watch r rated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin
<START> i just viewed jean <UNK> wonderful film french can can it is a visual delight and a great entertainment the recently produced <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by comparison i didn't quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received now i'm convinced more than ever that my <UNK> was correct after seeing a master film maker like jean <UNK> version of the same story he succeeded in getting great performances out of his entire cast and the great french actor jean <UNK> was in rare form the dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one i'd ever seen it was long but i didn't want it to end this film deserves to receive more recognition than it's got
<START> after watching the steven spielberg version of war of the worlds in theaters i was hooked on the topic i could think back to my favorite parts in the movie people getting <UNK> people <UNK> fire explosions it was all so great br br so a few weeks later i enter my video store and i see david michael version of war of the worlds on the shelf it couldn't have come onto dvd that fast could it i said to myself i read the back of the case and saw c thomas <UNK> instead oh i remember him from the <UNK> so i thought it might have been a try br br i was wrong dead wrong as soon as i watched the opening credits watched them take forever i knew something was wrong something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did the whole movie <UNK> like a cheese <UNK> that was left in the <UNK> for 10 years from the acting the special effects stupid looking <UNK> things when people get <UNK> they turn into orange <UNK> and most of all it didn't even come close to being as interesting as the spielberg version in fact the plot was boring and there were only 3 scenes of destruction what the crap i ended up being so bored that i had to fast forward through the movie until i found something that looked even remotely interesting and nothing was really br br my advice don't even touch this movie stay 100 feet away from it the spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month buy that one but please please i beg of you stay away from this turd before it <UNK> us all
<START> normally i am a typical creepy <UNK> girl but after watching this film on youtube of course i'm having different perspectives and also i did not know that my favorite animation studio <UNK> made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans <UNK> <UNK> and cigarette <UNK> footsteps etc and how a <UNK> young <UNK> named saves the day and wins the heart of honey the <UNK> i love the lovely ms honey you know after watching the film the bugs reminded me of the some of the bugs from don and out of the songs in the film i love we're a couple in the castle when i sing that song it almost made me cry br br this wonderful film was the second and final feature to come out of the <UNK> studio the film was originally going to be released on november of 1941 but since the <UNK> rival disney released <UNK> weeks earlier paramount changed the date to december of the same year but mr bug unfortunately went into a then <UNK> trap of terrible timing having the misfortune of opening two days after the attack on pearl harbor mr bug was a financial disaster and led to the of max and dave <UNK> from the studio they had established in <UNK> and <UNK> the company as famous studios another huge factor in their departure was the fact that max and dave <UNK> were no longer speaking to one another due to <UNK> how sad it was overall i love both films from the <UNK> bros <UNK> and mr bug
<START> jack o 1995 was a really bad movie we are talking <UNK> x 100 no entertainment value whatsoever no budget no gore z grade actors etc etc this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and shouldn't have been made the only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew <UNK> <UNK> was in it and sure enough she does her obligatory nude shower scene which is lovely yes br br but as for the film itself i fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had no desire at all to finish it it's just <UNK> lame ok br br i love horror movies i'm an avid fan a massive fan i love low budget horrors i love it all but i hated this rubbish so i think that will tell you all you need to know about jack o br br i give this movie 2 10 the 2 is for the 2 minute <UNK> shower scene the movie itself is a total zero
<START> i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival br br this is the first indian film i've seen in the <UNK> language and while it does share some similarities with other indian films wonderful music and choreography sweeping storyline the director attempts more than just to entertain the film tells the story of a <UNK> nine year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to war torn <UNK> <UNK> gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence <UNK> to make a point though it is a simplistic one is played by p s and she is one of the few child actors i've seen who can be <UNK> and yet not annoying her charm and beauty held the film together
<START> know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie but this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason furthermore many changes have made the story illogical a few examples 1 in the movie paul really meets before he dies in the book <UNK> only gets a letter telling him he is afraid to be killed this is completely stupid because if plan would have succeeded <UNK> would have known that the dead man would not have been <UNK> was in the <UNK> when mrs identified the victim 2 the movie has combined two persons into one cinderella has been removed by the movie the girl <UNK> falls in love with and the ex girlfriend of jack are one person in the movie why for god's sake 3 <UNK> finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player totally unfunny and stupid 4 the movie tells secrets much too early for example at the very beginning so you know things you shouldn't know 5 the murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesn't exists in the book perhaps because the person cinderella who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie 6 the book is very complex the movie takes only about 90 minutes sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning e g <UNK> race
<START> brilliant film i am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like pulp f but thats how it is with post pulp era many pictures get automatically <UNK> to it for only being a gangster flick but this one is well written funny <UNK> ordinary gangsters who are family men resemble something from tarantino which is a good similarity br br anyway the film's about a guy bloke in australia which is getting mixed up with a hard core crime gang and ends up in a debt and deep s it to his assistance is his deceased brother anyone remember val kilmer in true r to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail the gangsters are cold blooded but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children they also get served tea from their <UNK> while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their kids during the robbery so a humorous gangster flick with heath ledger in good form though i'm not a fan and bryan brown in great action as a gang leader
<START> i completely disagree with the previous reviewer this movie has amusing moments but hardly a laugh riot unless you really think <UNK> from a <UNK> tank and heads exploding in a vice are a laugh riot in fact the only reasons i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 are because a two of the actors are decent b the soundtrack is above average with some <UNK> pop songs thrown in for contrast and c the monster truck is pretty terrifying br br other than that this is a movie with some <UNK> creepy or interesting ideas which are overwhelmed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the former best friend character is one of the most annoying i've ever seen and the small grace that the <UNK> character had disappears in yet another contrived twist ending that makes little to no sense at all br br a waste of the lead actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress portraying the <UNK> character
<START> i gave this a 2 and it only avoided a 1 because of the occasional unintentional laugh the film is excruciatingly boring and incredibly cheap it's even worse if you know anything at all about the fantastic four
<START> worth the admission price for the rock off alone any d fan will love this movie even though it's a tad short and cameos from john c <UNK> ben stiller tim robbins <UNK> and dave just about <UNK> prove that the d rock hard enough for anyone even <UNK> the sasquatch <UNK> scene is going to become an instant classic i don't want to say any more and be accused of putting spoilers in here fans of the original hbo series will see a couple of <UNK> to the <UNK> early on screen appearances in characters such as lee and the open <UNK> host i only wish that they had played a few of the songs from the first album and the <UNK> of 'the government totally from the <UNK> album is also a shame other than that this movie rocks <UNK> the d
<START> this is absolutely nothing like the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> i have always been a dedicated <UNK> fan and i never took a glimpse of its competition now i <UNK> the day that i wanted the <UNK> to take charge at the least the <UNK> would try something new and radical all the time instead of keeping up as a mask of the actual intentions of the show and this holds true to <UNK> as well the <UNK> has always been about hulk hogan andre the giant and other old <UNK> like so and the <UNK> only happened to catch up with the radical ideas of the competition the wwe is the same trash as it was before the attitude era only <UNK> down and the <UNK> are terrible the brand split is mind <UNK> and the story lines and are non existent the wwe is so bad that it <UNK> to even be a former shell of itself by pushing characters and <UNK> into the main event suddenly and by <UNK> <UNK> of creativity sure the show shakes the brains of sweet innocent and easily brain washed children and <UNK> lousy <UNK> stupid people of the internet wrestling community that actually consider the company anything good anybody that even <UNK> and rests on the thought that this show and product is good can go straight to hell
<START> i first saw this film as a teenager i'm now in my 40's and have long considered it to be my favorite movie the story is enormously moving without being sentimental the acting especially by march and loy is dead on and the fact that dana andrews is too old for his role doesn't take away from the believability of his romance with <UNK> wright whom i believe is the only major character in the film still living this could have turned out to be another post war melodrama but the script and cast are simply too good for that to happen
<START> when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it nothing to do not in the cinemas nor on dvd neither on blue ray absolutely nothing how it's possible this could really happen the direction is impeccable the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and james franco is hot as hell br br please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance br br
<START> a few words for the people here in <UNK> club the worst crap ever seen on this honorable cinema a very poor script a very bad actors and a very bad movie don't waste your time looking this movie see the very good or any movie have been good commented by me say no more
<START> this is a awful re make of a very good movie called up in the air starring frankie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> reynolds i was only able to get through about 20 minutes before turning it off almost all the lines are identical i have no idea why they would re do the movie i totally disagree with a previous post that <UNK> the songs there the same also in the original the singing is first rate i'm not sure if <UNK> reynolds actually did her own singing it's hard to tell since the <UNK> were usually added later and the songs are very good surprising in a b movie if you get the chance see the original it's available on dvd you'll be pleasantly surprised
<START> yes <UNK> cried a couple times and so did englund and most probably you will too the whole cast is back in action and <UNK> has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messed up <UNK> i mean this in the best possible way i first thought maybe <UNK> or steve o were the main go to guys nope the main man is now johnny don't get me wrong everybody and i mean everybody is great in this flick right from the get go you're laughing and believe you me don't plan on <UNK> that smile of yours i personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first you know when you go into a theater and you kind of don't want to have high expectations for it well this movie blows all expectations away if you love jackass you can go into this with gigantic expectations no matter what you'll laugh your ass off if you're not laughing the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest <UNK> is that you were eating jack sh t for breakfast and jack left town all i have to say is prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie
<START> i think it's about 3 years ago when i saw this movie accidentally i <UNK> the info site for it here and immediately i felt good again i remembered seeing this movie and loving life again it showed me i could find love and what do you know i have a boyfriend for a year and a half now and love is definitely there
<START> something i think some people miss about great science fiction is that it <UNK> some part of the future no other theatrical movie that i can recall predicted that when the space <UNK> went to study <UNK> <UNK> that a disaster would occur some differences were the <UNK> the <UNK> in the movie actually went to the <UNK> the <UNK> was only in low earth <UNK> the <UNK> was merely burned out inside whereas the <UNK> <UNK> hey the vampires had to get back to earth one great similarity and this is always bad luck both had mixed male female <UNK> the legend of <UNK> <UNK> and disaster continues br br other than this there is not much more to be said about this movie that hasn't been said before as a outer space science fiction horror sex film <UNK> it provided nothing really new but as in all great <UNK> it is the combination that counts and taken together this was a highly original and satisfying combination br br i just wish <UNK> may would drain her victims through another part of the body
<START> big fat liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing great production and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent <UNK> the two stars work great together and what can i say amanda <UNK> shines putting and lee <UNK> in the film were brilliant touches watch this film with your kids if you don't laugh throughout it you must not have been paying attention
<START> the italians are <UNK> masters in the questionable art of ripping off and imitating movies what they do is take an innovative money making and foreign concept maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action sleaze and political <UNK> but what to do when the non italian original is already a <UNK> notorious film and quite difficult to <UNK> in terms of <UNK> and controversy well then i guess you simply disregard everything in terms of story building or <UNK> and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie this italian turkey was inspired by richard <UNK> successful slavery saga <UNK> released one year earlier but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth character drawings unsettling atmosphere or thought provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships is pure and simply a <UNK> effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already the characters in this film are a gathering of despicable <UNK> which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in south america the elderly and <UNK> sleazy owner of the place is a widower who probably also won a couple of <UNK> of the year awards who exploits and <UNK> the slaves working for him his mistress who if i understood correctly is also his cousin is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and <UNK> out of the house overnight to with <UNK> slaves when the plantation <UNK> son returns from europe after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last the handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times even in front of the slaves supposedly to demonstrate how their masters do <UNK> but eventually he falls in love with the <UNK> <UNK> daughter his romantic <UNK> obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever hey  i just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes sound like an interesting film well it's not and i apologize if i raised anyone's it's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through but if the themes appeal to you then definitely check out the aforementioned <UNK> much rather than sick exploitation that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film with real actors great music and impressive filming locations has nothing absolutely nothing to offer
<START> i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it but even more shocked by some of the comments i have read here one person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not therefore one person wrote that since he wasn't an american citizen therefore some people comment that the people in the middle east hate us and want us dead therefore so are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an american citizen are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead are we saying that as is written in the <UNK> convention the <UNK> of human rights and the <UNK> of the united states that torture is wrong but some torture is less wrong than others when does it become right to torture that is why this movie is powerful it is ambiguous but not about torture torture is always wrong and if we are willing to do it even in the name of justice and national security or freedom and democracy then we are wrong and we are evil we are doing exactly what we are <UNK> our enemies of doing and we are calling them wrong in the same breath my favorite line in the film was if you don't want to compromise join <UNK> international right on
<START> the joe cool review <UNK> <UNK> br br starring bruce <UNK> as phillip john <UNK> dr paul <UNK> <UNK> vargas as <UNK> and doug <UNK> as <UNK> br br plot this follows a <UNK> of the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> which started with phillip who created the box that opens the <UNK> to hell starting with the 18th century to present time when <UNK> first meets <UNK> and tries to <UNK> the <UNK> he's the only one who can stop <UNK> you see and finally in the future in space where paul <UNK> has finally figured out how to send <UNK> to hell for good br br <UNK> this is a movie hated so much by the people who made it they <UNK> fictional director alan <UNK> would be the credited director they only pull <UNK> out of the <UNK> when they really think they've made a terrible movie such as classics as the birds ii end or <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> no i didn't make that up how did i like it you're reading this so i'm sure that's what you want to know br br the good this movie isn't as bad as you've been led to believe oh i'm not going to sugar coat it this movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster but it does have some <UNK> <UNK> this time around for starters such as the twins and the demon <UNK> <UNK> is still in a main role and still has good lines pain has a face allow me to show it to you and it's somewhat entertaining throughout <UNK> will love the movie because of it's endless supply there is also some continuity with the rest of the series although you'll have to look hard to see it the dog is awesome br br the bad but for a story about hell vs the cursed <UNK> <UNK> that could close the <UNK> forever it was really complicated and held together with <UNK> tape nothing was really explored to it's full potential and there were some really stupid things included <UNK> kidnaps a kid and holds him for <UNK> random deaths just to feature more blood not always a bad thing but not for the sake of the story <UNK> is at his worst here he <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> even when he's about to die for the very smart demon that he used to be he's been reduced to nothing more than a bond villain at best if <UNK> fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back into a cameo like role this is it <UNK> ruined it for us all br br the ugly gore is always mentioned here this one has skin ripping <UNK> hook <UNK> <UNK> and more <UNK> the dog while awesome <UNK> of bad special effects during the chase scenes br br final verdict this movie had the potential for something great even <UNK> levels of greatness but all of that was wasted who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap but we can only blame alan <UNK> br br compared to the rest this movie is the worst of the <UNK> series for <UNK> only br br rating 1 2 of
<START> i bought this because it was 1 99 and harry carey was in it and a friend of mine was in it and for 1 99 how bad could it be then i read some comments here on the film and began to get excited maybe this really was a lost gem one of those terrific little b movies everyone had forgotten about but which deserved to be <UNK> wrong i'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it got from some quarters here but i found it one of the most tedious and blatantly <UNK> filled movies i've ever seen and i'm not talking about richard <UNK> hokey texas accent straight from the georgia part of texas i guess it's just dumb no one in the film behaves like a real human being no one and no one does anything believable or interesting it's not even a cliché fest it's just 80 something minutes of frames going by it even managed to make harry carey maria and c <UNK> smith boring now that's unbelievable
<START> more suspenseful more subtle much much more disturbing
<START> definitely not a film to <UNK> the industry or introduce any new techniques of film making this is a very handsome and solid production it's <UNK> that we can today enjoy it in superb quality on dvd probably most of the viewers about a 100 years ago saw a black and white copy as the <UNK> de edition was available only at the very best theaters even if you are not fascinated by this film or the subject of it you can't but marvel at the copy released by image entertainment together with another gem from the <UNK> to the cross <UNK> it's virtually impossible to see a film that is over a century old but shows so little damage the process of <UNK> was a very effective one and compared to the occasionally <UNK> and <UNK> images of hand <UNK> film the colours are crisp and well defined filmed within the limitations of the film making as known back in <UNK> when the filming <UNK> the static nature of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> keep moving at a steady <UNK> so the film never gets tedious you might not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography but it sure is handsome as a work of academic <UNK> art if you are a religious person the fact that you are watching anonymous long since <UNK> people playing long since <UNK> characters adds to the mystery significantly a proper viewing for christmas or <UNK> br br p s i've <UNK> the contains spoilers box just for fun as you can see i haven't revealed the ending
<START> spoiler alert although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain br br <UNK> <UNK> is by far the most successful expression of david lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his <UNK> tv series as lynch <UNK> know his is a style and vision uniquely <UNK> from film noir horror movies <UNK> and  with a healthy dose of <UNK> self consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure all these elements are richly at work in <UNK> drive ' making for a riveting hair raising and highly satisfying film experience  especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical mystery <UNK> whole br br the film features wonderful performances by <UNK> <UNK> and laura in the lead roles of young women whose lives <UNK> in various ways amid a hollywood setting that is itself an blend of contemporary reality retro <UNK> nostalgia and satirical self <UNK> their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film's opening scene in which character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a <UNK> not to mention horrific <UNK> accident <UNK> down the <UNK> from <UNK> drive to sunset <UNK> the two most <UNK> of hollywood she finds her way to the very apartment that betty <UNK> <UNK> is about to from her <UNK> ruth ' a <UNK> successful actress who is off to canada to begin a new movie as we later learn betty had herself arrived from deep river <UNK> shortly after winning a <UNK> contest br br a highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre credit prologue sequences that frame <UNK> descent from the clichéd would be bright eyed innocence to the <UNK> madness of <UNK> lover and going nowhere bit part actress unable to remember her own name the character <UNK> the name from a movie poster for the film noir classic <UNK> that <UNK> aunt <UNK> apartment actually it turns out aunt ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings anyway betty <UNK> to help rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in <UNK> purse the two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to <UNK> true identity they also by the way become lovers at one point <UNK> such an <UNK> chemistry that i cannot recall its equal in mainstream <UNK> of lesbian lover affairs if a lynch movie can ever be <UNK> <UNK> br br at the local restaurant a recurring location <UNK> with dream like significance behind its <UNK> realistic <UNK> <UNK> attention is caught by a name tag reading ' this leads her to a <UNK> of someone named <UNK> ' whose apartment the two women soon visit and at <UNK> <UNK> break into i won't reveal what they find within but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage <UNK> creepiness subsequently rita wakes in night <UNK> speaking spanish and <UNK> betty to an all night magic show theater called ' where the arts of illusion and lip <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> with manic intensity and where the blue haired lady as she is noted in the end credits <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> framed by the blue lit red theatre the blue haired lady <UNK> the last shot in the film perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination  rather like <UNK> man with the blue guitar as <UNK> through bad drug <UNK> br br during the sequence and as del <UNK> cameo lip her own powerful spanish rendition of roy a shattering <UNK> occurs when betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a <UNK> that obviously matches the key in <UNK> purse even if we do not delve too deeply into the <UNK> sexual symbolism of <UNK> the moment is a <UNK> <UNK> one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete <UNK> of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings not the least of these <UNK> is the discovery that betty is the sought for diane <UNK> and the <UNK> lover of <UNK> <UNK> i e rita <UNK> in turn is a latin femme fatale movie star to whom diane is <UNK> for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and more significantly to whom she is emotionally <UNK> br br after these and other <UNK> in the last third of the film the problem of <UNK> for the first two thirds of the movie is not so <UNK> resolved as in ' while bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much if not all of the earlier material is projected and <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> of diane herself other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural <UNK> of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from <UNK> peaks ' including michael j anderson <UNK> his <UNK> powers and a bob <UNK> who hangs out behind and is the ultimate <UNK> for the blue box and its id like <UNK> br br however one fits the pieces together though the whole of <UNK> <UNK> is much greater  and more mysterious  than the sum of its parts lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive provocative and disturbing mind trip what's more the film's cinematography is stunning the soundtrack filled with <UNK> <UNK> the acting superb and the directing editing masterful this may well have been the <UNK> best picture of 2001 among major american releases
<START> cedric movie is easy <UNK> charm wrapped in nostalgia for our younger years and attractive <UNK> at its core it's the feature length presentation of the long running mtv reality soap opera known as the real world in which as its <UNK> goes this is the <UNK> <UNK> of seven strangers picked to live in a house and have their lives taped so watch what happens when people stop being polite and start getting real this is exactly what happens minus the cameras planted at every <UNK> corner of the house in <UNK> spain where <UNK> comes to stay having to learn spanish to fill into his <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> in many ways he slowly forms a <UNK> with his house mates who come from all <UNK> of europe except america this is a movie in which the only american shown is an unlikable character with whom wendy the adorable kelly <UNK> is having an affair with only for sex she <UNK> since she has her own boyfriend who makes a late but <UNK> appearance throughout his stay there he tries to maintain a long distance relationship with his girlfriend played by audrey <UNK> while he begins a <UNK> <UNK> with the wife of the owner of the spanish house where he is staying at and gets some advice from a lesbian house mate <UNK> de france as to how to seduce a woman a sweet little feature that presents a moment in time that twenty somethings will never see again is forgettable fun containing within itself the <UNK> into the real world experienced through eyes
<START> where do i begin with the killing mind before i mention the good bit this movie is about a young psychological <UNK> fbi woman or something that for some reason goes to work for the <UNK> for a wee while there are some <UNK> faces like the i love you man bloke from wayne's world playing a cop nice beard age too and two guys who always seem to play cops playing you guessed it cops one of them was one of the cops in gross point blank following john cusack about the place and the other is the fbi guy with <UNK> in final destination who is also in the fugitive as another cop i know the fbi us <UNK> cia etc aren't cops but they're all the same they <UNK> the law to a certain degree that makes them cops in my book feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop all you want they're still seen as the ones who are trying to bring the bad guys down any i <UNK> the woman is working alongside these cops who just seem to sit around in a library in the basement or something and for some unknown reason decides to <UNK> a case that hasn't been looked at for she saw the dead body as a kid so naturally decided that she can <UNK> the case <UNK> she was personally attached to it i also like how the person <UNK> other people's psychological state witnessed a murder scene as a child surely that's the kind of thing that can screw with someone's head she starts asking questions off some journalist who covered the story when it was open even though he appears to be the same age as the woman so he presumably was either writing for a newspaper when he was 10 or he wrote a few school reports on it and she decided he'd be the best person to ask about it br br we then see that as well as <UNK> homicide cases from 25 years earlier she tries her hand at petty <UNK> as some really <UNK> bloke through a busy street wearing a <UNK> way to blend moron anyway she and the cops she's with eating ice <UNK> in the park give chase after him and whilst crossing a bridge with a woman and child standing on it the thief grabs the baby from the mother's arms and throws the baby in the river this if you haven't already guessed is the best bit of the movie i'm not sadistic and don't have a hatred for babies or anything but the scene just looks so stupid i promise you will wet your pants laughing at it if you should watch this movie it gets better when the cop from final destination the fugitive jumps in to rescue the baby then declares to his friend it's a baby how did he not know that before he jumped in is beyond me br br anyway she chases after the thief but loses him later on she remembers that a random dog didn't <UNK> at the thief so assumed it must be his and decided to track down the thief through the dog the dog had no <UNK> or anything on it so how she knew where to find the dog and thus find the thief is another question i won't go into it was shortly after this that i stopped watching the story was moving really slowly and after i had stopped laughing at the baby throwing bit i had kind of lost interest and missed what was being said br br saying that i'll go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist bloke because he seemed a bit <UNK> and she was spending a lot of time with him and anyone who watches columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy plus other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious so i'm sure it was him br br so all in all a pants film but worth watching just for that one glorious scene
<START> this all looked quite promising an up and coming presidential <UNK> is framed for a series of murders as he has been <UNK> off that a conspiracy is going on within the white house it stars the excellent donald sutherland among several capable actors yet very few people have a good word to say about it br br the whole thing really needed some depth you can pick up the idea that the president is being too left wing with his ideas and some within the government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out conrad appears to simply want the country to be <UNK> his way rather than the way of the elected leader br br however the action scenes had a few logic holes the <UNK> and <UNK> already mentioned and the rather <UNK> assassination method and linda <UNK> character is completely uninspired her 'the <UNK> my <UNK> was ludicrous that would make the president about 10 when that happened worse still was her predictable final scene with bishop br br they could have made a challenging inventive political thriller but either <UNK> it or failed they could've gone to town on special effects but the good ones were wasted they could have achieved so much more in general this was barely worth the <UNK> it cost me
<START> last week on friday i went to see snakes on a plane with my friends it was amazing compared to this horrible film however many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious basically some woman has a <UNK> curse where she <UNK> up harmless harmless <UNK> snakes that instead of attacking crawl inside of they're victims the girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot on the title screen it says 100 passengers 3 000 <UNK> scary i know there weren't even 100 passengers on the train only a couple of <UNK> and some other washed out losers it's worth the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge cg snake and <UNK> the whole train then get sucked into a huge <UNK> though it's just sad that someone would go to such <UNK> to make a crap film only to make a few bucks because of the snakes on a plane <UNK>
<START> pat <UNK> <UNK> book the water is wide proves to be something of a southern up the down <UNK> yet despite the teacher going against the odds formula really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash these students <UNK> black kids on an island off south <UNK> are actually shown learning and their collective wide eyed innocence is remarkably sweet the one actual actress in the bunch tina andrews an amazing performer plays the tough nut has to crack and once she falls under his charms it all seems a <UNK> but the story is not ready made for a happy ending and i wasn't prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale it's beautifully done the script <UNK> off course every now and then but director martin <UNK> is very smart to always fall back on jon <UNK> solid presence scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van <UNK> his <UNK> over a <UNK> don't add up to much but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion and the actual ending is their payoff 1 2 out of
<START> ok so this is a complete rip off of the first karate kid however i think there can never be too many movies like the first karate kid there's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me you get a overall sense of being able to overcome <UNK> by finding out new things about yourself in this movie <UNK> <UNK> is a particular gem as the next karate kid you can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her br br not to say this movie is not without it's problems unlike the first one mr <UNK> appears to be a little to eager to get julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting it almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie also one must have a suspended disbelief when <UNK> the monks the movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life and doesn't really explain why they do what they do in the plot line the villains are also a bit questionable even though truly <UNK> bad guys i also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end on prom night br br so maybe this isn't a perfect movie so maybe this wouldn't be the greatest movie to rent on a friday night however in more ways than one it's a guilty pleasure <UNK> <UNK> is just so <UNK> and the story even though unoriginal works in a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence this is a breath of fresh air unlike all those steven seagal and jean claude van damme this is a movie about the spirit and the heart there are some people that need movies like this and we'll take whatever we can get my rating 8 10
<START> in the line of fire in my opinion is an excellent suspenseful and edge of your seat action drama thriller i thought that agent clint eastwood and agent raines <UNK> russo looked good in the <UNK> they wore at the presidential dinner as for <UNK> john <UNK> he was a sick man who loved to toy with frank by phone he looked good in the <UNK> he wore near the end of the film though one thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between agent and agent raines before i wrap this up i'd like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job i loved the setting and i couldn't get enough of it now in conclusion to all you clint eastwood fans who haven't seen this excellent suspenseful and edge of your seat action drama thriller i highly recommend it
<START> i've always liked sean connery but as james bond i've always <UNK> roger moore still it was connery who set the bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than james bond the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as <UNK> and save the world from the evil designs of <UNK> br br and what designs they are in never say never again <UNK> with the help of a foolish young air force officer who happens to be kim <UNK> brother stole two nuclear <UNK> during a war games exercise and now <UNK> headed by played here by max von <UNK> is threatening blackmail of the world br br von <UNK> <UNK> guy is <UNK> maria <UNK> who is also <UNK> <UNK> and is a bit on the crazy side and he's got a female assassin working for him in barbara <UNK> who makes angelina jolie as nora <UNK> look like mrs <UNK> br br but before sean connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new <UNK> running things at british intelligence edward fox thinks connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the british too much money with his violent ways i really did enjoy <UNK> performance he's like the great <UNK> of colonel <UNK> br br i also enjoyed <UNK> she's something to look at and quite <UNK> in her methods when she's <UNK> diving with connery in the <UNK> note how she puts mr shark on case br br will connery do james bond again he was widely <UNK> as saying who would they cast him as at this point roger moore's father but i think connery would still be <UNK> in a wheelchair
<START> this film gives a look at the suffering a family experiences at the death of a child and the healing that can finally come to them br br the family learns of the death of their son on christmas eve 1991 ruining the christmas season for them they do not celebrate it again for many years there is an interesting comment by the daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation br br the matthew character makes a reference to jesus but i suspect that other comments he makes come from non christian sources i wonder if any other viewers would recognize those comments if so it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie
<START> i don't know why imdb lists all the <UNK> films as theatrical releases they were all straight to video films same with the puppet master series why hasn't anyone noticed this yet right somehow you've stumbled across <UNK> iv probably <UNK> through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993 you looked in the <UNK> section and found this look at the back and front covers what do you expect the <UNK> redemption there is no need to review this film so <UNK> it is the fourth <UNK> film i bought it on dvd for 50 because it was 50 i knew it wasn't kubrick material and i was right an dvd with no extras not even a trailer boasts an for film br br it actually contains the star of the first <UNK> film peter who really didn't get many <UNK> roles apart from those two films and i don't see why he's not too bad an actor and is pretty fun but i guess if you're gonna take a lead role in the <UNK> films scorsese and tarantino will lose interest also present is his idiot sidekick bobby <UNK> who despite having a very small resemblance to al pacino very small <UNK> none of his acting ability a complete idiot who's just awkward to watch then there's <UNK> randall obviously a porn star i don't need to look that up she does look quite sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a film br br then there is the <UNK> themselves who also manage to let us down <UNK> iii made them start talking mistake no 1 but <UNK> iv takes it a step further instead of being puppets this time the <UNK> are in fact kids in costumes the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers also there's only two of them and they're not the main highlight of the film as they don't appear in a lot of it however at times they are mildly amusing and they're not evil this time either br br this really is hilariously bad stuff it's amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it i <UNK> why some of the black humour is actually funny though the script is mostly <UNK> imagine <UNK> only threat to you being that he will kill you slowly painfully br br but at least full moon had no involvement this time did they yeah a very bad and cheaply made film with 0 production value but not so bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master 1 2 <UNK> man 2 surviving christmas or even <UNK> iii
<START> i first saw this film in the early 80's on cable it was unique as a statement about the sixties culture war music race and a bunch of things i'm certain i missed however about a year ago it came back into my life as i started enjoying it with my son he's a little young 9 for a lot of the themes in it but he understands dancing hippies are fun to watch and he gets the idea that end is ironic while i can't think of other films in this genre it does have a stand alone genius i love it also does a unique justice to central park most musicals are lost on me one way or another tommy was over the top and heavy handed in direction oliver seemed like crowd control on the silver screen the wall was so much abstract self important and indulgent <UNK> but listening to failure of the flesh from hair sounds right for our times today as it did in the eighties as it must have in the sixties truly timeless
<START> this soft soft core sci fi b movie is what you'd have if you took an early fred <UNK> ray film and took out the fun or <UNK> it's like an uwe boll <UNK> but without as much <UNK> a young <UNK> chain gang convict c c <UNK> agrees to pose as a space <UNK> in order to stop wacky kim <UNK> plans of having everyone have sex with everyone else apparently that vile fiend anyone who went into this film looking for serious science fiction well you got what you deserved for not doing any <UNK> on the film at all first of all when did kim dawson ever star in anything other than soft core <UNK> level crap for that matter take a look at the <UNK> for <UNK> and the director before you take a <UNK> fit saying you expected something else don't get me wrong for a space action soft core <UNK> flick this film is still not good but if you expected something along the lines of contact i do not pity you br br my grade d br br where i saw it <UNK> on demand available until december <UNK> 2005
<START> the movie which was directed by alfred hitchcock was brilliantly made it starts with a family of three a doctor james stewart his wife doris day who is a former stage singer and their young son my guess is about 10 years old who are traveling through for <UNK> on the bus the <UNK> into a french government agent and they are a little too nice to him he is killed at the <UNK> after finding out the information he sought he wants to carry this information out to someone so he goes to the only person he even slightly knows james stewart the <UNK> kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him his son would be killed stewart has to travel to london because that is where his son is and where the <UNK> that the agent told him about would be the movie is very suspenseful there are many twists and turns typical hitchcock movie also it has just the right amount of comic relief in addition to all of that it won an oscar for doris day's performance of <UNK> sara sara this movie is very good it is hard to find a problem about it i would certainly <UNK> it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans i give this movie an a only because it is a little bit predictable
<START> my husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than fatal attraction well not liking either michael douglas or glenn close i would have to agree not for conventional reasons though br br this is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet br br <UNK> butler is a really enjoyable bad guy she is not the best of actresses in fact she isn't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film everyone else in it <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a <UNK> <UNK> br br spoiler the ending goes a step or two too far complete with the cliché not quite dead up with a <UNK> still gonna get you moment and then there's a shot of <UNK> with his frozen wooden <UNK> which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling or just forgot there was <UNK> in the make up br br regardless it's a hilarious <UNK> odd minutes and despite being a bad film you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat don't pay for it but if you're in that kind of <UNK> telly mood then this is just right
<START> it would be <UNK> to judge that that either narrative or documentary to be more authentic than the other both <UNK> have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers seek to <UNK> and <UNK> stories in their perspectives as both <UNK> usually leaves some issues due to of and screen time it <UNK> viewers the opportunity to open up <UNK> and to further investigate and <UNK> the real truth adding to the viewer's inability to <UNK> sources <UNK> comparisons with written history and the <UNK> behind arguments history may be open to <UNK> through narrative and documentary br br to most people documentary may be seen more truthful as it usually involves actual <UNK> and real life <UNK> however these visuals are selected and edited to be arranged in a way that allows producers to present their version of realism to the viewers in the real buddy holly story paul <UNK> seeks to establish the buddy holly as remembered by family and friends and how buddy had influence the rest of the music world the <UNK> may have been distorted as memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend out of buddy the documentary did make <UNK> to the film version and cover other events such as there were 3 members of <UNK> and that <UNK> music was actually heard outside of usa at that time he had to <UNK> on a world tour however it did not go into deep discussion about what happened to <UNK> wife after his death criticism and or negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers seek to present a buddy that the world should have remembered eventually we don't manage to <UNK> the whole truth as we only <UNK> ourselves to the past that the documentary tells us br br personally i prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual which helps us to <UNK> with the collective memory of that era it gives the audiences a more <UNK> structure of the story and this leads to better memory <UNK> for the audiences when they <UNK> the story there is also an element of <UNK> which allows film makers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues in the buddy holly story racial issues were <UNK> and viewers can certainly relate to these issues with respect to current situations br br movie goers consistently seek to <UNK> certain emotions when watching a film and using these emotions audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a film maker wants to deliver in most stories people are more likely to <UNK> remember the struggles the <UNK> and the way the story ends through the buddy holly story we do remember the struggles buddy and the <UNK> had how maria had been a source of <UNK> and that buddy holly was a great performer until the day he dies
<START> it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed <UNK> is how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on i did not like the film it's crappy br br there are <UNK> they have taboo sex gay sex <UNK> sex <UNK> sex rape <UNK> sex masturbation brother sister sex brother brother sex sex on drugs sex without drugs sex sex sex seems to rule their world i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid the story is just dirty and shameful i wonder what made those people get up with this story and above all who cares br br the technical stuff didn't satisfy me as well the sound is poor so is the editing and the direction is absent the actors are admittedly fine but guess what it's their job their job is to act no need to jump off your seats if an actor did a decent job do you applause when a bus driver brings you home safely see br br i gave it 2 10 because after all this thing had something that i can't put in words b movie charm camp fun nudity i don't know
<START> that separate good memorable movies from movies like this its not entertaining touching funny interesting and at times feels a little sub human the principals act like they are other <UNK> in the worse way when they are supposed to be relating to each other and the audience br br starts out <UNK> enough rich kid gets new car for <UNK> but the dean says he can't have the car until after the ceremony goes joy riding nonetheless and stops in the diner on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick argument with the local <UNK> wise <UNK> the waitress girlfriend of the head <UNK> shockingly they play chicken until they accidentally burn down the diner they left three minutes earlier aren't all <UNK> five feet from the gas station br br they told they have to pay the price in court so the only reason to get this <UNK> out of <UNK> to stay in town is to come up with the scenario that both boys have to assist in the <UNK> of the diner worse than that the rich kid in staying with the family of the un rich kid in the room above the attic that <UNK> above the has rescued many a person in need of a bed br br rich kid inexplicably is treated well by the girlfriend who never mentions to him that he nearly killed her this does not <UNK> well of course with her boyfriend and is never fully explained you don't know why sam <UNK> <UNK> falls for <UNK> chris <UNK> or why <UNK> josh <UNK> allows it br br chris <UNK> is tolerable <UNK> completely <UNK> and josh does not register much of an impression the character with the most life is the judge that sentences <UNK> and <UNK> to help re build the diner she gets off at least one funny remark which is more than anyone else does everyone is so <UNK> and <UNK> that you will feel a little <UNK> if you even think of smiling while the movie is on br br the ending is one way to end the piece not the most original but at least it was over i don't enjoy <UNK> a movie that some little girl somewhere in the world might really love but since i am not one i have to the <UNK> thing i can say about this movie is that its not mean spirited and although it fails to <UNK> its innocence and home <UNK> corny dialogue comes from a nice place 4 10
<START> after missing out on this <UNK> times on tcm uk i decided to check it out given its sci fi adventure camp <UNK> i knew <UNK> be in for a thoroughly silly ride â but it was also <UNK> bad anyway perhaps appropriately given the characters involved the script rips off many sci fi titles then of recent vintage â soylent green 1973 <UNK> 1974 run 1976 to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self same sets star wars 1977 alien 1979 and mad max 2 the road warrior 1981 br br the plot is simple but not exactly engaging from the title one can <UNK> that water has become <UNK> on the planet where all of this takes place â so our <UNK> <UNK> heroes take it upon themselves to steal ice <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also involved is a beautiful princess mary crosby daughter of bing in search of her father the <UNK> king by the way the cast includes another famous <UNK> <UNK> huston daughter of john as one of the pirate band â thankfully the mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an oscar under her <UNK> <UNK> no less for honor 1985 since star wars had peter cushing as the the film makers <UNK> to have a screen legend of their own â <UNK> year old john carradine <UNK> seen <UNK> to a sort of operating table during his one brief scene br br the most notable bits for all the wrong reasons are the alien using the toilet the <UNK> machine the clumsy antics including karate style combat of the inevitable robot companions the goofy slave <UNK> make up worn at one point by the heroes the recurring attacks by the whatever that is the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time <UNK> crosby becomes pregnant gives birth and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds while leading man robert <UNK> himself is replaced by john ford <UNK> hank <UNK> for this scene â incidentally the jump cuts adopted here <UNK> to <UNK> the rapid passage of time are not only <UNK> but downright irritating
<START> this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen in my life it is a complete waste of money and time i went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie said wow what a good movie someone actually walked out it was absolutely terrible it was disgusting and i hated every minute of it my friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with rick on the ceiling <UNK> she had had enough it was not funny at all believe me i went with 11 other girls and not one of my friends liked it it was ridiculous i've seen many movies but this was absolutely the worst i mean a scene in the movie is with an old man making out with a dead person in a coffin i just can't make up these things
<START> with its ww2 timing falling in and out of love and easy on the eye <UNK> this is re <UNK> br br this a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of ww2 poet dylan thomas his way between wife and ex in dark and <UNK> <UNK> london and later in <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a <UNK> while the girls bond and share an easy watch that works well in the era <UNK> along with just a few <UNK> in pace would work well with french subtitles but then i may have been to too many art house movies lately
<START> oh how i laughed this has it all an asian white family a disabled asian boy everything a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of the bbc br br what utter tribe this was a total insult to my eyes that viewed this rubbish for one episode and one episode only br br when you think of some of the quality the bbc has put out over the years <UNK> towers for example and then this comes rolling in its a disgusting disgrace br br its all <UNK> on political correctness and is devoid of any humour whatsoever br br this is straight from the <UNK> of hell but what would you expect from the ultra left wing i mean bbc
<START> night of the demons is definitely one the definitive cheesy 80's demons horror flick in the same vein as the brilliant evil dead and demons movies this movie combines <UNK> sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie a definite welcome addition after the 80's were <UNK> by slasher flicks it was nice to see something a little different br br the plot follows a group of teens who all meet up for a halloween party at <UNK> house which used to be funeral <UNK> <UNK> by angela about 40 minutes of <UNK> and eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the <UNK> and <UNK> each and every one of the teens add some <UNK> make up effects lots of gore and cool looking demons and you've got yourself a sweet 80's cheese fest that would be <UNK> as one of the best demon related films in many horror <UNK> lists br br firstly i loved the setting for this movie <UNK> house is really creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons emerge that's when the action really kicks in and it becomes a night of terror and fear this movie <UNK> 2 sequels the first one in 1994 which was okay but nothing come <UNK> to this and the third one titled demon house was absolutely horrendous this is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come br br all in all a fun cheesy flick with demons that's definitely worth checking out
<START> this movie had very little good points the special effects and acting was horrible for sure but it was a movie made on a low budget so you dont expect much from it it does have some laughs i doubt they are intended though the scene where the old woman <UNK> down and touches dung that was on the floor then puts it to her nose and goes in a really stupid <UNK> voice was priceless all in all if you have nothing else to watch and just want to laugh at a really crappy flick trying to cash in on the blair witch success then grab it other then that dont bother
<START> i'm not sure why there are no <UNK> or posters or anything about this film because i just saw it and thought it was awesome i guess it's not for everyone because it's basically <UNK> the trial meets and butt head which is a pretty tough combination to swallow still i thought it was great if you're going to see it because you want a sequel to office space you're probably going to be disappointed but if you want to see one of the most brutal acid <UNK> and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed you're in for a treat i just saw the <UNK> show opening night in los angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater which means the film will probably be gone in a week that's really a shame because in its own way <UNK> is one of the best <UNK> to come along in quite a while but then again it's basically making fun of the people who make up about 99 of the movie going audience so i guess it's no wonder the studio <UNK> and tried to dump it
<START> i have walked out of a <UNK> movie before and not quite known how to feel the two best examples of that are the big <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that i had to like it on the other hand there were some unnecessary <UNK> with flying people and killer <UNK> balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film still i liked the film and now own a copy of it <UNK> made me <UNK> with <UNK> sometimes i wasn't sure why i was laughing so hard that it made me cry but nonetheless i was there were many seemingly strange characters in <UNK> but upon further investigation they were really just real people talking about real situations that is why the man with the <UNK> or was it a <UNK> was so side <UNK> funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night and that is also why the theater <UNK> in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in i own a copy of this film too the <UNK> have a way of <UNK> their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall but if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany you will always find that in some strange way they all ring true that is what is quite exceptional about o brother where art <UNK> this is a film that is out there i mean it is not even in the same <UNK> as a traditional film i reviewed the film <UNK> this past summer and in it i said that <UNK> was an okay film that i have seen a thousand times before but you can not say that about a <UNK> brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one br br this film has everything in it from a jail break crooked southern politicians <UNK> references to what i can only assume are historical figures <UNK> bank <UNK> violence towards animals singing <UNK> of religious fanatics <UNK> lynch <UNK> and so on there are obviously many references to <UNK> odyssey in here as well but i wouldn't know that because i have never read <UNK> odyssey or even knew one thing about it every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof like quality towards it makes the film that much better well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it i can tell you that it is still an entertaining film there were times when again as is usual for a <UNK> film i wasn't sure why i was entertained or laughing but i was br br this is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates he has to take them along because they were also <UNK> to him when they had their chance to escape br br i like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are <UNK> <UNK> it was nice to see goodman again it was nice to see hunter and especially <UNK> who seems to have a place in every <UNK> film it's too bad they didn't find a place for steve <UNK> but that is a different story all together but back to clooney the man just has charisma he is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own <UNK> his work here is quite awesome and i really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character br br now after <UNK> all this praise on the film let me just say this as well i didn't really enjoy the film at first i found it to be quite tedious and a little boring there were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into <UNK> them for all what they were worth but then the film began to grow on me it took a while but it did grow on me i don't think this is their best film but it is still a good one and i am giving it a 8 5 but the reason that i do recommend this film is for one reason only br br every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself seen it seen it oh seen it last year that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film most films have been recycled in some form or another not the <UNK> films they have not been recycled and if they have i don't know about it that is reason enough to see something that they put out originality counts for a lot in my books the are original and they are good and that is not common in todays cinema enjoy them while they are allowed to make films because you don't get vision like this in many films so when you do enjoy it
<START> actually i am not <UNK> the main plot in this comment but with just 2 3 sentences i can make it a spoiler ok here are these br br speed is just a 85 <UNK> of hollywood flick <UNK> into bollywood by using the <UNK> <UNK> title has no match with the story only it goes in the thriller direction just that it doesn't deserve even a single star for its imitation <UNK> casting poor standard and predictable story undoubtedly now i can say that <UNK> is slowly <UNK> away from his director status as no any <UNK> audience will appreciate his recent works including this beside him too making his <UNK> as cartoon comic type who knows how long will he last in the film industry more sometimes the standard in the performances and cinematography look like lower than a c grade movie but most supportive role was played by khan which was somewhat identical with chris <UNK> role as ryan in <UNK> with innocent face <UNK> <UNK> has no contribution in the movie as he has nothing to impress that's why those who have already watched <UNK> i advise you never to waste your time again with this imitation sack
<START> another great performance by <UNK> sutherland i love his movies because he always plays his role very well for a low budget film this was done very good and kept me on the edge the whole time i love these type of movies and i was glad i caught it on i'll be buying the dvd or tape for sure br br 9 10
<START> even mst3k couldn't make this painful long and ultimately mind <UNK> <UNK> funny or entertaining while most bad movies in and of themselves are hilariously bad this one is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense br br the element that makes this so painful to watch is not the lack of story but the fact that <UNK> much background is <UNK> into the first half hour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving with no <UNK> br br the hero of the film <UNK> is no more than eye candy for this literal energy sucker of a film dressed in a <UNK> cloth and sporting <UNK> like <UNK> as joel put it he belongs more in a <UNK> magazine than here br br i would recommend this only to die hard and i mean die hard followers of cheese if you have an enemy recommend them this film if you make it through this i <UNK> you you should be able to make it through anything
<START> many consider beast stable to be the last of the true female prisoner films as it is the last of the series directed by <UNK> and is followed by one other film grudge song by a different director i have not seen grudge song yet but soon will so i don't know how it <UNK> up to the previous <UNK> films but it will be interesting to see the way beast stable ended didn't really leave a lot of room for another predecessor but i guess i'll find out br br this entry has <UNK> on the run from the cops where she <UNK> up with a street hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child oh yeah that's no lie gotta love these sleazy story lines <UNK> ends up being kidnapped by an old rival but as she is so good at ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that <UNK> a few of her hooker friends br br i agree with some other reviewers that this one is a little slower at points and more serious then the previous two entries the story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times but a lot of these 70's era <UNK> films are and i still love them beast stable is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing but i thought it strong in other areas storyline cinematography some good sleaze etc definitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing or who have enjoyed the other female prisoner films 8 10
<START> there is something about true stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction i guess it is the fact that truth has always been stranger than fiction the <UNK> and the snowman tells the true story about christopher <UNK> and his buddy lee <UNK> <UNK> is a former alter boy and intellectual trying to find an <UNK> that can support and entertain him his fbi father is able to pull some strings and get his <UNK> son a job working in the defense department <UNK> has few <UNK> and seems to be <UNK> drinking and <UNK> around with his co workers however as time goes on <UNK> starts to learn top secret information that causes him to doubt the morality of his government the <UNK> <UNK> soon sees the illegal <UNK> that the cia is carrying out in above all places australia <UNK> eventually decides that he will <UNK> some of the top secret info he is <UNK> to to the <UNK> of course mistake is the <UNK> that because the usa is doing bad things the <UNK> is the good guy over time <UNK> and his drug dealing buddy lee penn start to sell their top secret information to the <UNK> what was once <UNK> turns into capitalism and espionage the strength of this movie is the incredible performances by <UNK> and penn although one of them starts off with the best intentions they will both soon find themselves in an <UNK> <UNK> spiral great direction music everything not only a great film but one of my all time favorites
<START> while many pass this off as a b movie it is indeed a first class comedy that is well written and acted red <UNK> is great as <UNK> <UNK> better known to radio fans as the fox ann <UNK> is perfect as <UNK> <UNK> carol <UNK> conrad <UNK> leads a very well cast gang of criminals i read one account of this movie which states that <UNK> <UNK> directed this film not unless he changed his name to s <UNK> simon who directed all three of the fox movies this is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged so get over your black and white prejudice if you have one sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy this was also <UNK> first starring role take note during the climax of the reference to orson welles' war of the worlds broadcast
<START> is a long film for its genre and quite often the pace is much slower than that expected by western audiences that being said i enjoyed it thoroughly both in terms of interesting subject matter and the magnificent images this film contains some of the scenery is truly breathtaking and there is enough of interest that most should be able survive with minimal use of the fast forward br br
<START> oh gosh i'm really fed up with all these generic japanese horror films about long haired female ghosts and ghostly kids ghost train is no exception it is clearly influenced by <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> and pulse two years ago i was into such modern ghost stories because they usually managed to give me some <UNK> unfortunately there is nothing fresh or interesting in ghost train in fact the film is really boring <UNK> goes missing in a subway tunnel like an <UNK> school <UNK> <UNK> must investigate a mystery of multiple <UNK> with the help of a youthful train conductor and another disappeared child's mother the film offers some mildly creepy moments however the cgi effects are laughable and the climax is illogical skip it
<START> excellent performances and a solid but not <UNK> story helped this movie <UNK> my expectations this movie was far better than i was expecting after some of the reviews i had read but frankly those reviewers just got it wrong very inspiring and uplifting highly recommended
<START> <UNK> by thin experience of both life and industry and no cash <UNK> <UNK> early short is almost by necessity an <UNK> piece set on a high school campus the cast are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b w it's difficult to tell the characters apart the sound editing does little to help a simple story of <UNK> teenage <UNK> br br yet there are one or two things to note the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of <UNK> wide and intimate close up shots the editing to music also creates an interest and momentum without descent into the <UNK> of the music video coppola clearly made an attempt to <UNK> the pace of the film the dramatic turn is cut fast and to the point and the second act is almost non existent we <UNK> it's actually been played out in <UNK> with the first which is the point of the narrator on <UNK> <UNK> who is an otherwise curiously <UNK> character in that first act br br despite these notes it's an awkward short 2 10
<START> this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop actually it's really just about the girl nicole since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes the movie gets going extremely fast and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length it isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere br br the story is not only paper thin but <UNK> stupid and incoherent minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop she sees the flashing of a camera and knows that people are inside but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger she walks around the rest stop doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things this includes turning on a tv and even looking amused when she thinks she's stumbled onto a porno movie even in this dire situation sitting around wandering and drinking from a bottle of <UNK> for hours on end she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been <UNK> that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety she doesn't bother to lock the doors or remain alert oh yeah she tries using a radio to call for help but why even bother when there's a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the story br br there's no sense of <UNK> or ever present danger in this story the heroine <UNK> wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her before driving off again there's nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else that's better than sitting around but she chooses to stay anyway at one point in the movie the main character even <UNK> that she can run off but doesn't br br the story doesn't go anywhere and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment nicole finally gets inside the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of <UNK> presumably <UNK> or psychotic religious fanatics they seem <UNK> ignorant or <UNK> about the killer's actions but there's no indication that they're connected to him in any way and then kick nicole out after several minutes br br in the next irrelevant segment the main character wanders into the bathroom building she discovers one of the killer's previous victims a young woman named tracy who is still alive and locked in a closet for some strange reason tracy starts <UNK> ridiculous amounts of blood nicole goes off to <UNK> a <UNK> to <UNK> open the closet door and when she returns a minute later both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation what was the point nicole finds a <UNK> board showing many missing persons and sees that tracy had disappeared in 1971 so was tracy a ghost or something the writer never bothers explaining br br next a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop which had been conveniently left <UNK> for the entire day so far nicole tells him all about what's been going on and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office the cop goes outside to confront him what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and <UNK> talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killer's lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him over br br the cop quickly starts telling nicole that he's a <UNK> who's lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesn't die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the all important fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole <UNK> wastes most of her bullets <UNK> shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a <UNK> blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shock br br nicole finally confronts the fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like tracy was she gets a policeman to go inside and check it but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet the cop leaves thinking he's been tricked a <UNK> nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of 10 seconds looking apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there wow br br this movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality direct to dvd movies <UNK> as being too extreme for theaters in reality it's just more cliché b movie garbage
<START> this is a terrible film angie <UNK> is a class act and always does well but she does not get many roles any more and she must have needed some money to do this film by the way she is on screen less than 10 minutes <UNK> wait there is one redeeming feature in this film meg foster has a small part in this film now meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not particularly great but she has the scariest eyes of any actress i have ever seen by name you probably don't know her but one look at her eyes and you will recognize her to <UNK> the acting is horrid the story bad and even the filmography is dreadful a screen going to black every time the director wants to change scenes is pretty moronic watch any thing else but this even mr ed reruns
<START> this is another universal fun filled fright fest many people want to compare it to house of frankenstein even though it has similar cast and the same director it can stand on its own it does appear that c directed most of the universal horror films of the 40's br br the plot <UNK> baron appears at the home of dr seeking a cure for his <UNK> larry <UNK> who somehow survived house of frankenstein also shows up at the good doctors door seeking a cure for his <UNK> after a failed suicide attempt <UNK> and the doctor find the frankenstein monster to <UNK> matters just before he bites the dust dracula <UNK> the good doctor with his blood the doctor becomes a <UNK> maniac at certain times where this leads to is something you'll have to see for your self br br carradine actually gives a very good performance as dracula he isn't chewing up the scenery as he will in later roles it is hard to <UNK> <UNK> when he appears in a top hat though the cape cloak is traditional but the hat has to go where does the hat go when he changes into a bat br br <UNK> stevens gives an excellent portrayal of the doctor he's torn between his basic kindness and the increasing blood lust he is now prone to this is a very underrated performance <UNK> brings even more life to the wolf man in his 4th appearance in that role br br the monster isn't given much to do this time just lay on the table until the end some stock footage from the ghost of frankenstein is used at least in house of frankenstein he was up and around a bit br br yes this does stick to the basic universal pattern complete with the angry village mob running amok with <UNK> but it isn't a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes it gets a low 8
<START> well at least we have to acknowledge the big hollywood horror producers are finally getting smarter and more <UNK> instead of <UNK> waiting to buy the rights of asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in america they now discovered they could simply hire the asian directors and <UNK> them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states that's like killing two birds with one stone way to go guys the is pretty much identical to every other supernatural <UNK> that came out of the oriental countries ever since <UNK> roughly translated this means it's a boring overlong and entirely gore free film but it does feature <UNK> amounts of false scares and embarrassingly weak did we scare you yet moments the <UNK> brothers danny <UNK> previously made the extremely overrated the eye and it sort of is a tradition for them to build up a story with clues and hints towards a point where it becomes nearly impossible to meet the expectations of their curious audiences yet they don't seem eager to alter their formula any time soon and they're also <UNK> enough to <UNK> the same old repetitive ghost topics over and over again restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote countryside farm the protagonist family torn apart by <UNK> <UNK> from the past so they first have to <UNK> faith and trust in each other give me a break throw in a <UNK> and a seven days curse why don't you even the attempts to make you jump in your seat are too <UNK> <UNK> and won't scare anyone over the age of 7 <UNK> doors filthy gradually larger growing <UNK> on the walls ghostly appearances noises coming from the <UNK> the endless <UNK> of cheap tricks like this is almost becoming insulting to horror fans the revolves on a family on their way to a new life in the country as the <UNK> of the family situation is kind of dysfunctional since a personal tragedy which doesn't get revealed until late in the film caused their youngest son to stop talking and the parents to <UNK> their revolting teenage daughter soon after the children experience strange <UNK> in remote <UNK> but they don't manage to convince their parents to leave that's pretty much concludes the entire film little ben sees things but he can't talk and jessica repeatedly gets attacked by supernatural forces but nobody <UNK> to her the basic premise of the is very derivative of stanley kubrick's immortal classic the shining only it lacks the constantly ominous atmosphere and disturbing tone the script takes itself far too seriously even though it's fairly easy to predict the final denouement and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable at least the eye delivered some genuine shocks in the end whereas the happy happy joy joy ending of the is just pathetic the only positive elements i can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations the adequate editing job and the promising young acting talents and beauty <UNK> stewart and there's an uncanny but sadly underdeveloped supportive role for william b davis

<START> it's exactly what the title tells you an island inhabited by <UNK> doctor <UNK> <UNK> and crew land on the island they're either picked off by the or <UNK> into working for treasure hunting lunatic richard johnson <UNK> discovers that johnson who believes he's found the lost city of atlantis has been keeping <UNK> scientist joseph <UNK> and his daughter barbara bach hostage for 15 years so the can <UNK> a treasure <UNK> beneath the sea <UNK> of course is a complete madman bach and <UNK> have great chemistry this insanity was directed by sergio martino and is not surprisingly without merit it's fast paced reasonably well acted and the look pretty convincing though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things don't look like actual there's an excellent music score by <UNK>

<START> one of the finest movies i have viewed good script original plot of a man who is haunted about <UNK> assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that cold november day in 1963 thirty years later another anti social lunatic wants to <UNK> the current president the secret service agent loses his partner along the way to the crazed <UNK> who schemes lies and murders anybody in his path <UNK> stand in his way of his mission br br the movie <UNK> with a great memorable score and a restrained but meaningful romance between russo and eastwood which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work is great sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played but how many could acted with such <UNK> and intellect that he displayed in the movie br br needless to say i thought this was a great movie <UNK> it's on television i have to watch it and i own it on dvd i'm a big eastwood fan this only <UNK> his already fabulous career and best role to date br br
<START> i saw this at my in <UNK> house one night when it popped up on tv and my mother in law said it was one of her favorite movies well she can have it br br look i can enjoy a chick flick now and then as long as it's good but this one's extra sappy unrealistic and just plain predictable despite some decent performances from rock hudson and jane <UNK> it's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her <UNK> taken away from her oh well they say love is blind br br the neat and <UNK> happy little ending nearly made me gag too and how often did we need otto <UNK> repeating the title it happened not once not twice but three times
<START> along the history of cinema there's been a few films that <UNK> the viewer such as hitchcock's stage fright <UNK> <UNK> los <UNK> david <UNK> the game and this one absent to begin with i don't like this kind of films i feel like somebody is trying to pull my leg br br furthermore after seeing this film one doesn't know what happened is such a confusing film kubrick's the shining may be a better or a worse movie but definitely is more honest than this load of pretentious and dubious situations br br technically is fine nice photography fair performance and so on but the script is so poor i wonder what did the producers see to carry on and shoot this crap br br and this film remarks the 3 guys that wrote the script and are lost in cinema trying to make a masterpiece or trying to do something to fulfill their <UNK> awaiting for more personal projects
<START> took a very good book and completely butchered it nothing was as it should have been some of the best parts of the book were missing including the major point of the whole book simply the worst adaptation of a stephen king novel ever this movie made the mini series for it look good
<START> i had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival <UNK> introduced the film and did an hour long q a afterward br br this is a brilliantly done documentary <UNK> explained afterward that he does not consider his films to be true documentary since facts sometimes <UNK> the truth instead he scripts some scenes and ad <UNK> some to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original story outline br br little <UNK> unlike timothy is a real person that you fall in love with you cheer for him you feel the anguish that he feels you admire the sense of humor and joy for life that he <UNK> here 30 years after he was taken into <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> you are disappointed to hear afterward that <UNK> passed on not too long ago br br as in most <UNK> films the imagery is <UNK> beautiful with a wonderful choice of background music especially a scene of battle taken from <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> war but fitting the story line of <UNK> br br the core of the film has <UNK> return to the <UNK> jungle where he was a <UNK> and he re <UNK> his journey with some locals harrowing for us to watch i can't imagine what he felt as he was bound again br br one of the better films to depict and discuss the nightmare of the <UNK> <UNK> war it should serve as a lesson to us all
<START> norman final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous <UNK>  bringing his accident prone <UNK> up to date this being a product of the swinging sixties the end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the <UNK> typical slapstick and sentimentality with mild sexuality and even <UNK> satire the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a <UNK> <UNK> falling for teenager sally <UNK> who doesn't mind getting involved with him but doesn't take their relationship all that seriously either sarah <UNK> appears as friend who warns norman of her <UNK> character br br the film is nowhere near as bad as leonard <UNK> bomb rating would have it and if anything is interesting for its treatment of mid life crisis being in many ways similar to hoffman 1970 and 10 1979  both of which incidentally i've only just watched towards the end norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking the pretty things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and norm himself sings the catchy title track
<START> well as you can see i got to this party quite late but have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments i found this site by happen chance when i was looking for other marine <UNK> films so let me start by telling you that i played a marine boot in the movie <UNK> and was <UNK> at san diego at the time jack <UNK> and his crew selected 15 permanent <UNK> of which some of us had the speaking parts and another 15 marines that had just completed boot camp that made up the platoon and the marines who portrayed the various <UNK> to the best of my <UNK> the capt and <UNK> <UNK> don were not in the marines we spent about three weeks up in hollywood studio city film lot <UNK> shooting the section of the movie that we were involved with and then they completed the other shots after we left br br so as i <UNK> along here let me <UNK> some of what has been <UNK> in previous entries as best i can <UNK> daddy was commenting about the ability of our platoon to yell yes sir without moving and etc yes we did the yelling for the sound guys and it was while shooting the scene as you fellow marines remember when the <UNK> or who ever started to ask a question and before they completed it you had already taken your breath of air <UNK> you to yell at the top of your <UNK> the proper response that is how it was done br br commented about walking through the same building at paris island however as i mentioned earlier all the scenes were shot in studio city <UNK> they were built from photos taken at paris island and from on site <UNK> and marine <UNK> from paris island sorry you were in the real buildings not the sets br br brought up many good points but about the incident with the platoon at paris island at the time all that jack <UNK> said to us was the movie came about because of the accident and the marine <UNK> didn't want to put out anything that would impact any of the family members of the marines that died that night although the marine <UNK> would provide any marines and assistance needed for a movie answering to the public why a marine <UNK> does what he does br br as mentioned by a few of you i also at the time we were shooting the scenes caught my self thinking this dialog has been <UNK> up to much and obviously isn't how it goes down in real life back in the 50's that is how it had to be done br br one story i would like to pass on is about the interaction that occurred between us marines and the movie crew and between the movie crew and jack <UNK> from the start by <UNK> the marines <UNK> yes sir to anybody that moved going into the second week it was getting more common to hear yes sir coming from all directions on stage someone would <UNK> out a request for something to be done with the lighting and from out of nowhere up on a <UNK> above the set a <UNK> of yes sir would sound out to all of this at one of our <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> stated if i had known that i would have gotten this much respect from this crew i would have brought you guys up here years ago there was a lt brought up from san diego to play the role of the <UNK> from the other platoon and the one jack <UNK> fights with but during one shooting he was up to take number <UNK> and still <UNK> kept trying to work him through how he wanted it done and didn't show any lack of patience with him the next day they used the paris island <UNK> who was a <UNK> sgt from paris island and he worked out fine br br at the time i was somewhat of a camera buff and got to know the still camera man to get some <UNK> from him and as it turned out he would give me still shots and some of the <UNK> film of the daily shooting that were not going to be used those film <UNK> i cut up and made <UNK> out of them after the movie came out in vhs tape the <UNK> b w <UNK> min my kids and the grand kids have a blast when they try to se who can find me the most times on the screen
<START> i almost stopped watching hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines one exception for this is <UNK> <UNK> movies this is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast this is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories the adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good you should watch this movie for <UNK> <UNK> based on the life of <UNK> cop this movie deals in a more realistic way the film <UNK> into the life of the common man which he has apart from being an encounter <UNK> i rate this as one of the best movie of the year
<START> big and we mean plus sized big baddie sebastian <UNK> is trying to run salt of the earth <UNK> off their land in order to get the oil rights when sea <UNK> sterling pop is killed how will <UNK> put an end to terror in a texas town armed only with a <UNK> br br first off this isn't a b western there are no singing <UNK> no <UNK> stunts no interesting action sequences it's just an independent movie you know the ones that use <UNK> actors to say important things and cover the general low budget of the goings on with interesting camera angles br br second this movie to avoid <UNK> one expects that would cause the <UNK> of important statements about justice in america and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl is really low budget the main problem that causes is that the acting is really really bad sterling <UNK> is decent enough in tough roles but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the west sebastian <UNK> tries to do a sydney <UNK> as very <UNK> it's not a bad idea but <UNK> does not have the acting chops for it the guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul johnny has the best role in the film he does nothing with it br br third the script really isn't all that gets some <UNK> in about the immigrant isn't going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town and the people when up against real <UNK> tend to back down this is a pretty stale movie message by 1958 high <UNK> bad day at black rock devil's <UNK> are all westerns that deal with the <UNK> of western society with an eye to the <UNK> of 50s america in certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments but he isn't doing anything new or interesting with them br br so given all the <UNK> why does this movie get a 4 mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie the relationship between and his girl is um fascinating and while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political <UNK> is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them just when one is ready to pass out from <UNK> movie boredom will come an exchange of dialog or simple <UNK> that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hack br br if you don't like or westerns give this one a miss otherwise try it you might like it more than i did
<START> yeah i know the girls are hot and the scenery lovely but for someone knowing the place it's hilarious br br if you want some accuracy this is not a movie to rely on it starts with the flight from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> aboard a <UNK> this will never happen on the 400 <UNK> flight smaller planes such as <UNK> or a <UNK> passengers between the two cities every half an hour the drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate <UNK> <UNK> back and forth perhaps the producers tried to <UNK> one of the very known drivers when faced to tourists not that it would be a local habit as i myself got ripped off in very serious places such as switzerland the girls yes all topless that's something an <UNK> will never understand brazilian chicks will be happy to expose 100 of their incredible bodies at the <UNK> schools <UNK> and wear almost non existent <UNK> at beach but never go topless a handful <UNK> across the whole country will allow it all carefully secluded and out of town oh the <UNK> decoration the amazing <UNK> maybe in <UNK> apart from that it is very entertaining and yes <UNK> moore is absolutely splendid
<START> i truly love horror films try to give every one i see as much credit or sometimes more as possible but this is really pushing the ticket most of the cast were very like able but hardly any of them could act at all but then again think about the writing dialogue of this mess some good make up but absolutely ridiculous special fx all in all i give it 3 out of 10 am having second thoughts about that
<START> paul muni and bette davis <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> studio hack <UNK> <UNK> seems distracted and oblivious in this <UNK> provocative film that <UNK> its bittersweet ending by <UNK> <UNK> attitudes heavy handed and poorly constructed the film <UNK> under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an out of control courtroom scene that it never <UNK> from as mr muni begins to chew up scenery by the yard <UNK> and howling away in an almost incoherent fashion br br johnny <UNK> is a mexican american from the other side of the tracks who through determination and <UNK> <UNK> a law degree from a store front night school in his first big case involving an auto accident he displays only <UNK> and is quickly made to look the fool by his well <UNK> opponents and an <UNK> judge who <UNK> he be <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> an angry johnny takes on a job at a gambling joint where he is <UNK> by the owner charlie eugene palette who likes his style the owner cuts him in on the place but problems <UNK> with mrs davis who also wants a piece of johnny she kills charlie <UNK> johnny and slowly goes mad before he is <UNK> and free to be with a high society <UNK> who <UNK> explains to him that they are from different <UNK> savage and it will never work when she <UNK> to escape his rage she is run over and killed by a car <UNK> sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood that its best to stay with your own br br in addition to this appalling denouement has a series of bad performances to compliment the overall <UNK> of the story unfair as his plight might be <UNK> <UNK> is so <UNK> and arrogant it becomes hard to show sympathy for such a bull headed davis is no better as the less than loyal wife matching the same adolescent emotions of muni her lady <UNK> mad scenes give no indication that she was about to become the best film actress of her era margaret lindsay as <UNK> american dream is cold remote and flat br br bad as is and it is very it remains an interesting <UNK> of the times and acceptable attitudes the rest is just a <UNK> of bad acting and uninspired direction
<START> it's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen it never <UNK> it never slows down it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot that along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie <UNK> and salman are outrageous even <UNK> and <UNK> are funny in this movie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> deliver some great bad guy comedy but <UNK> and the wannabe are the best with their <UNK> bad guy intentions if you want to laugh and enjoy a movie watch this movie do it with family or friends you will not regret it most indian movies tire me out by the end cause they are 3 hours long this movie is just as long but i wish there was more when it ends cause it's an amazing flick
<START> i wish i was first exposed to this in a movie theater when it was first released as some of the <UNK> had been it really is a treasure to be fair i have not seen any other version of goodbye mr <UNK> and neither do i want to to me this stands as a perfect version i first saw it on tcm years ago and never forgot it i had the pleasure of watching it with my girlfriend yesterday although i had recorded it from tcm days earlier there were portions of the movie in which both of us were <UNK> eyed it really is a moving movie br br and shouldn't that be what movies are all about br br the music is beautiful the film was shot wonderfully the acting is top notch and the story is delicate and timeless br br one of my favorite movies of all time
<START> unlike some of the reviews written here i didn't hate this movie it is a movie that could have been much better than it was not oscar material true but much better than it was br br i thought the plot had a good hook and through line granted this movie was badly written and terribly directed and produced i mean how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have why were we there what exactly is the point of the opening sequence it seems like the producer s watched american beauty a few too many times and thought <UNK> use that in an action movie ' i thought the movie wasn't that badly acted wesley snipes did a credible job he just ran <UNK> of some bad direction and once this movie hit the production room things just got worse the main actress i think had the same problems some of the other acting was suspect yes but it was a low budget flick again i would say it is the director's job to pick that up and correct it br br as an overall recommendation i would agree with the first review i read that this movie is not worth seeing or maybe it is worth seeing if you are a film student and want to see what not to do br br 3 10 and that's giving it praise
<START> so much for judge and jury which lives up to its nonsense title what good is there the lighting is terribly <UNK> another horror movie you ask well that's perfectly <UNK> david keith actually does pretty good at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> while being the killer who escaped death row but overall despite some new twists it's reasonably stupid has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently and this one only means so much we the jury find this film guilty for its <UNK> exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time
<START> i was very disappointed by this movie ms english who says that she is a fan of the original movie seemed to have taken a great piece of artistic work and transformed it into a flat <UNK> ho hum you've come a long way baby production i tried to like meg <UNK> mary haines but she was just boring she didn't seem to feel anything about her husband's affair there was no emotional struggle no deep hurt in the original 1939 movie norma <UNK> mary haines felt betrayed shocked vulnerable confused and angry the 2008 production was more about some fake <UNK> theme actually my wife's words and didn't make you shed a tear or even chuckle the only performances that were note worthy we're of debra messing and bette midler i wanted more of bette there was really no protagonist in this movie the sylvia <UNK> character had too many sub themes to it and crystal allen had no fire the remake of the department store encounter with <UNK> <UNK> and miss <UNK> was luke warm also the pacing was slow as well obviously the 1939 version needed to be updated but this one wasn't it the reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with man problems a subject by the way which isn't out dated the magic of the original movie was that the movie was about both <UNK> while you never saw the men
<START> little <UNK> needs to fly was my first film during the 1999 edition of the <UNK> <UNK> as i was extremely tired that evening i was <UNK> to see it but the raving overall score of 9 here at imdb made me go there br br it was 80 minutes of pure life force experiencing <UNK> life through his own telling was enchanting br br see it and if possible see it at a cinema
<START> this movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the north <UNK> party or some similar group the strong man places himself above the law but not outside the law and <UNK> <UNK> citizens by killing worthless trash the only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the <UNK> was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group and you'll see what i mean br br it's a tragedy that jimmy page actually made music for this movie
<START> relentless like one of those loud action movies the entire cast seems to be on speed i didn't quite get the director's intentions if any i wonder if she's ever seen a stanley <UNK> vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical structure please this is one hell of a mess and i loved <UNK> the costumes the <UNK> photography <UNK> towards the actors but loving towards the locations the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself no chemistry with her friends christine <UNK> and julie <UNK> think of streep with lily in the altman film and you'll understand what i was hoping for i was embarrassed in particular by pierce and colin <UNK> the audience however seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me
<START> there is part of one sequence where some water rushes into the <UNK> plane everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for airport <UNK> you can even make out jack lemmon and christopher lee in some of the shots a total rip off well almost by definition there may be more stock footage in this film than in plan 9 from outer space br br all the new material actors sitting around in an airplane set talking is bland and terrible on every level dennis weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie though that's true for everyone other than this films director fred <UNK> ray who uses one of this many necessary fake names in order to keep working br br there is a level of <UNK> <UNK> that makes this film such a waste of time it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all because ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst old school tv fashion that this film like most of his films is totally devoid of life the worst kind of hack work the worst kind of film boring br br this type of film is a waste of money an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever <UNK> pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared <UNK> in this rip off there are so many people who want to make movies it's disgusting to see ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill time br br his commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really fred ray as he isn't credited on the film itself that tricked me into seeing it don't let it trick you
<START> this is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s otto preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them frank sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by elmer <UNK> is dynamite from the opening titles by <UNK> bass to the <UNK> of drug addict frank going cold turkey this is a riveting movie with kim novak giving a very good performance <UNK> parker giving a very bad performance as well as darren <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> and arnold as <UNK> <UNK> pal beware of bad <UNK> this movie is in the public <UNK> so some copies are pretty rough
<START> actually i have more a question than a comment i loved z boys and the <UNK> of <UNK> saw <UNK> first then the doc and while i loved the story i am curious as to why in the movie sid was an important character but in the documentary he wasn't part of the team and only merely mentioned as just some kid they knew does anyone know the story on that the story of these boys was amazing i never experienced the <UNK> <UNK> where i grew up but my kids have enjoyed it what i have seen in local <UNK> parks is what these boys had invented i never knew that when the film showed the competition and z boys did their thing they put to shame the others in competition
<START> from the opening sequence filled with black and white shots reminiscent of <UNK> parks photos this film draws the viewer into a feeling of artistic renaissance the backdrop of a poetry <UNK> <UNK> named the <UNK> provides just that the jazz that <UNK> the film and the cinematography will seduce you br br this story of love actually allows love to grow to <UNK> and ultimately mature a <UNK> in hollywood everyone can identify with some stage of their journey towards each other this tale of two artist that just can't quite get it together <UNK> a debate amongst its viewers should she have gone away should he have stopped her who knows br br starring <UNK> <UNK> darius and long nina <UNK> with a scene stealing performance by <UNK> washington and lisa nicole carson <UNK> <UNK> as the ultimate best friend this film is a romantic jewel br br see this one with someone you love <UNK>
<START> is some kind of saint he wants to live in life exactly how christ taught man to do but it's too late now the catholic church is between the hands of a wealthy <UNK> the <UNK> live in luxury and don't give a damn about the poor and the sick that's why our hero can't follow the way his <UNK> asks him to follow so he himself of everything and on his way to <UNK> he's joined by some kind of mary and a woman who's attracted by him sexually the scene between this girl and her fiancé is telling in spain it was the late fifties they thought was a christian movie knowing luis <UNK> it was downright <UNK> all his work is to a fault comparing and his holy women to jesus is a nonsense on way only and couch grass grow his attempt at helping working men on the road is a failure he's chased out as a strike <UNK> all his words amount to nothing at the end of the journey he's arrested and offered a <UNK> by a woman sexual symbol thanks to <UNK> was allowed to return to spain where the censors had not got a clue and to direct
<START> despite the all star cast this attempt at epic fails it comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too too clever social commentary br br it's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer <UNK> out and says isn't that clever am i not smart isn't that biting social commentary and sadly the answer is always <UNK> no <UNK> self absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera in the worst sense of the term than a movie and an obvious attempt at television <UNK> thankfully it died young empire falls falls flat
<START> this is a great western story with outstanding veteran actors who made this film great entertainment to view and enjoy glenn ford john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tries to play low key after having experienced battles in the war and plays the peace maker role for the time being john <UNK> decides the town is entirely too rough and tough and goes to visit barbara stanwyck martha crime of passion <UNK> who is the wife of edward g robinson lee the red house <UNK> lee offers john <UNK> fifteen thousand dollars for his ranch and john turns down the offer lee decides to have his son brian keith cole the wind the lion <UNK> change his mind in more ways than one there are romantic scenes between may <UNK> caroline <UNK> the caine <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> and some hot encounters with <UNK> foster <UNK> three hours to kill <UNK> who hates her father lee if you like edward g robinson and glenn ford films this is a film you will want to view and enjoy from beginning to end
<START> this is another of those films i can remember from when i was a kid and i recently managed to <UNK> it off ebay 20 years on it's nowhere near as good as i remember it being br br the story is kick started by a <UNK> there's another extra film crew member in the credits for story <UNK> which makes collective ants become super intelligent <UNK> species who used to war with each other have <UNK> <UNK> and are now working together the thing i wanted to know throughout was to do what exactly you never find out what they want <UNK> <UNK> and his sidekick travel out to the desert where bizarre <UNK> activity has been noted and begin to study the ants from an <UNK> shaped laboratory probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visit the giant square in the <UNK> like a square version of a crop circle a result of the ants <UNK> away br br this film was not very scary quite simply because you don't know whether to fear the ants or like them all you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their <UNK> but you don't find out whether they are really baddies it ain't a sci fi because the <UNK> explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account it is more of a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tight shirts with big <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> big facial hair do freaked me out more than the ants did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits <UNK> that right six and you won't see any other human beings in this film at all not even in the distance this is a <UNK> obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably won't have seen one like it i can't think of any anyway the filming of the ants is pretty good they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stick in the film you may well say to yourself <UNK> the hell do they get the ants to do that ' over and over but it is all quite simple you will also notice that the film makers sacrificed millions of innocent ants to make the film too so animal rights <UNK> stay away good for novelty value but you may not watch it more than once
<START> christine sandy and mary tyler moore holly davis worked well with material ted <UNK> did his best with a <UNK> role of chip davis the premise of this that the two <UNK> friendship one a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her <UNK> clock <UNK> i found the relationship that ted character had with the single woman played by christine <UNK> rather <UNK> he <UNK> in a way yet he left two <UNK> <UNK> over him <UNK> i found it revolting when when sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife he calls her saying he misses her did he call his wife there was no sign of that he <UNK> like a <UNK> it perhaps would have made a more interesting film had he not been killed off perhaps both ladies would have <UNK> up and dumped him i liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was spoiled by what they had in common the <UNK> of a husband
<START> i've watched the first 15 minutes and i can tell that there was no <UNK> with any military type <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an officer has her hair down past her shoulders one of the first officers that <UNK> her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is so overweight that his <UNK> <UNK> gap no there was no military <UNK> them on this movie even an ex military <UNK> could have <UNK> here
<START> this little short absolutely <UNK> me br br the only thing i've seen thus far like it is some of the work by sam the creator of dog star man however where is trying to <UNK> by making us learn how to see again and provide us with an <UNK> of head <UNK> inducing bright colors and flashes which i still totally dig and embrace as high art this film i would <UNK> as very relaxing and <UNK> man <UNK> general use of spinning objects camera does not create so much of a <UNK> feeling but a warm flow of senses <UNK> and going along with the gravity of the moving world around us br br an interesting <UNK> of this very short work is that as it goes along objects become more and more recognizable until we end on a nude <UNK> of which i feel is the least feminine well rounded breasts i've ever seen the circles and <UNK> of shadow and light over the <UNK> make it an object of <UNK> beauty something that you could hang on your wall and delve over forever it's because of this and other images in this film that i had to watch it again and again eventually a total seven times just because it utterly <UNK> me br br <UNK>
<START> i've seen a few movies in my time but this one is exceptional you'll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it it is emotionally very complex it explores love and passion at it's most extreme and it's cinematography is just breathtaking the character of the count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted the film has a sort of <UNK> <UNK> and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love tragedy drama and politics all in one this movie is <UNK> all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice hats off to michael for writing the incredible book on which it is based
<START> newly pregnant knight <UNK> from husband for non specific reasons which are apparently self related on the road she becomes <UNK> with <UNK> brain damaged former football star and duvall wacky but abusive cop the type of movie that could only have been <UNK> in the 60's worth a look for its non formula plot and for early performances by future stars br br disappointing resolution does not take away too much from rest of flick which shows an interesting slice of life
<START> this story of ted <UNK> an american pilot who is the sole survivor of the crash of an allied <UNK> plane in <UNK> in january of 1944 is pretty much of a mess the title would lead you to think that it is <UNK> a story about the <UNK> armed resistance groups but that seems to be just a backdrop to prop up a silly love story between ted and claire the woman who takes ted in <UNK> husband <UNK> is a committed resistance member but it is claire who decides in <UNK> absence and against his wishes to give ted <UNK> br br crucial plot details don't make sense central to the story is the <UNK> of the <UNK> on the <UNK> plane that contains <UNK> <UNK> and the positions of targets but in the opening scene we see <UNK> <UNK> the plane resistance members among them why did they not retrieve the <UNK> items at that time instead of waiting for the nazis to come and guard the plane and the whole affair of <UNK> ted out of the area was <UNK> using secret <UNK> and code words when the <UNK> could have just been a simple exchange the <UNK> music attempts but fails to lend some weight to this tepid <UNK> br br the most ludicrous part of the movie is how the love affair develops between ted and claire at first claire is devoted to <UNK> ted back from near death and when ted starts to recover they become physically involved while <UNK> is conveniently away <UNK> resistance business julie <UNK> does a passable job as claire but she effects a french accent that i frequently found impossible to understand her <UNK> seemed a little weak at times when informed of the hanging deaths of several town members she <UNK> as though she had just been told that the local <UNK> was out of <UNK> as ted bill paxton seems just to be <UNK> his lines his performance is so uninspired that it's embarrassing a true american pilot might evidence such a flat personality but it does not make for convincing cinema i did not sense any chemistry between these supposed lovers br br the most idiotic thing is the way that ted and claire act like lovers on holiday maybe sexual release from such heavy situations is understandable but to appear totally oblivious of the gravity of the situation is hard to <UNK> at first ted is <UNK> to an attic room and claire <UNK> about his even coming into the house but as things develop he not only comes into the house he dances with claire to loud music enters the <UNK> <UNK> to have a game of baseball with a local boy and ultimately goes on a car trip with claire to a nearby town br br the young boy seems to be most committed to his role but he is <UNK> by the script he has an uncanny ability to be at crucial events without being noticed and when he delivers lines like br br have you ever seen someone get <UNK> they look like dancing but they can't find the floor br br you feel that it is the screenwriter talking and not a thirteen year old boy br br and oh by the way there are scenes to show that the nazis are pretty bad guys br br comparing this film to the brilliant <UNK> and <UNK> about the polish resistance or the equally stellar <UNK> about the french resistance one realizes what a truly dismal affair it is
<START> first of all let me say that i am in no way denying the importance of the subject quite the opposite i am polish and i have been aware of the <UNK> massacre for quite a long time in fact two of my family members died there so i was looking forward to this film unfortunately i was disappointed br br i think the main problem lies with the script which <UNK> too many subplots and characters none of which are properly developed the characters are painfully one dimensional their stories are <UNK> but lack overall meaning in my opinion the cast doesn't really have a chance to show their ability the exception is portraying <UNK> the only interesting character i wish the story was more focused on him br br as a result the film lacks emotion before seeing it i thought i would be moved if only for sentimental reasons but in fact i was watching it with an odd sense of <UNK> throughout except for the final execution scene it is done well and its placing is interesting and provides a climactic ending although the idea of the <UNK> <UNK> being <UNK> in <UNK> by the executed officers seems a bit far fetched br br to conclude i suppose the film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the portrayed historical events but in my opinion it fails as a work of cinema
<START> so bad it's entertaining especially during cocktail hour and believe me you'll need a beer a drink or whatever to get through this turkey where do they get the financial backing for such paint by the numbers horror flicks the fun in this movie is <UNK> which characters will get eaten and in what order and <UNK> the so called uniforms the military <UNK> wear the <UNK> by the way are not the same <UNK> we met in jurassic park but a cousin species sorry no spoilers here you'll have to watch it to find out for yourself don't expect the plot to make sense simple as it is just go along for the ride you could make it a game take another drink each time you hear a certain sound or better yet every time someone gets by a <UNK> with a little luck you won't even remember having seen this c grade made for tv movie
<START> not many people have seen this film and it is a shame because it is a work of art the characters are brilliant the dialogue is sensational and the use of themes leaves the audience wondering i truly loved this film and can't wait to see more of matthew <UNK> work
<START> i thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment rupert played the part <UNK> and has a general knack for the acting business the almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot and was a character one could almost instantly <UNK> this reminded me in a way of the divine secrets of the ya ya <UNK> not by means of actual content of the film but the premises and overall tone to the film itself driving lessons is a coming of age story which many might find very easy to relate to due to the <UNK> mother the lack of freedom and the discovery of <UNK>
<START> may contain spoilers br br the main character a <UNK> named fallon is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning count de <UNK> <UNK> dee talks to his own hallucinations and sees all <UNK> on the island as <UNK> pirates he <UNK> beats mute servant anne and <UNK> his unwilling guests in the <UNK> laughs are provided by giant slave <UNK> who talks with a deep south accent and helps de <UNK> hunt down <UNK> in the style of the most dangerous game de <UNK> crazed wife <UNK> by <UNK> provides some truly scary moments as she <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> prisoner this scene was viewed on late night tv by many kids who carried the memory into <UNK> the one nearly normal person in sight is <UNK> who has self <UNK> down to a science i used to be a nurse now i'm not much of anything she and fallon plan their escape and ultimately encounter an enemy more <UNK> than de <UNK> and <UNK> combined br br this movie was shot in san antonio and directed by a man more competent at drawing horror comics than making horror movies i'll say this much for mr he does showcase his with <UNK> here as he did in his comics it's rather like an andy <UNK> melodrama minus the meat <UNK> the period wardrobe library music abuse of the handicapped and all around <UNK> makes one wonder if andy wasn't called in as a <UNK> however <UNK> made better costumes and wrote better dialogue technical <UNK> are too numerous to list here but you know this flick is in trouble when you see the opening <UNK> which looks like it was shot in a fish tank also a film made in texas should have had real <UNK> and snakes rather than rubber ones glorious <UNK> gives this melodrama the <UNK> look it so richly deserves <UNK> initial encounter with the <UNK> <UNK> is truly horrifying as is the movie's <UNK> shot if the rest had been half as harrowing the <UNK> of <UNK> would have been a terror classic instead it's a funny piece of schlock that trash <UNK> will love for all the wrong reasons
<START> absolutely the worst experience i have ever been through i think my eyes started bleeding i actually got sick the night after watching this i don't even consider this a movie movies are supposed to be worthwhile and entertaining this fails horribly i could not make it through the entire film so because the ending could be greatest phenomenon in motion picture history this gets a 1 for that small chance otherwise it would be a flat 0 br br i can't see how national lampoon or let alone any organization would <UNK> this atrocity renting this dvd is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life only watch this if you want to make ever other movie you will ever watch seem great br br without question this is the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> interesting twist on the vampire yarn fast loud and moody despite my initial fears kris k carries his part reasonably well and snipes aka blade provides a <UNK> physical presence lots of blood steel silver burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable <UNK> minute distraction if you like the black look of the matrix then blade will appeal to you blade even has a the sequence
<START> while it's true that the movie is somewhat interesting the execution leaves a lot to be desired much like blood orgy of the leather girls i spit on your grave and born in flames all superior i don't think it's not porn but porn is in the eye of the <UNK> if it functions as porn for somebody who am i to say that he she is wrong i was rather puzzled by the statement in generally thoughtful review such a shame that for once we actually see men's faces when they come a few years ago i did occasional <UNK> reviews for an adult <UNK> and i recall seeing plenty of men's faces when they came i think this is probably more common when the film features on of the few male porn stars and especially when that male is the director though i <UNK> can't refer to any specific titles i know that there are some instances in ron <UNK> uh work i also don't know that i'd agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability in his face when coming
<START> blues an impressive hbo movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several characters touching alive <UNK> a great mix of sound and story based on a true story featuring an all star cast a time capsule about br br you get the point and no i am not on the for the hbo crew i would throw around more <UNK> but i am about to go out the extras on the dvd include a deleted scene a <UNK> and commentary the funniest part about the <UNK> was star lighting they used when <UNK> <UNK> producer <UNK> <UNK> br br ok seriously good times a
<START> what a waste of energy and money what a waste of what talent there was br br <UNK> <UNK> was completely wasted and mostly <UNK> throughout jon <UNK> was very mildly amusing but pointless harry dean <UNK> why bother and was it just me or can <UNK> <UNK> barely act in this one br br the story was pretty non existent and really disjointed one of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that <UNK> like the surf <UNK> giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half how about that you never saw them surf once the set up to some scenes took way to long with not enough pay off to make us give a damn nothing in this movie felt really true or genuine br br the only good things i can say is some very little of the scenery was filmed nicely and a few scenes were mildly interesting don't see this when there is so many better pointless movies out there
<START> fulci does this man brings one of the <UNK> and <UNK> movies ever made answer yes cat in the brain also known as nightmare concert is <UNK> last masterpiece yes it is no matter what some people will say about it there are few facts why this movie is one of the best <UNK> movies br br fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one lead roll in this movie is no other then fulci himself who plays well horror splatter gore director who thinks he is slowly going insane it's filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here being fulci flick you need to know it's gory how much well pretty much i always loved gore in the movies and i never get enough of it but cat in the brain actually stopped my <UNK> for gore and believe me it's a hard to archive even the <UNK> didn't stop it is all about gore almost every scene revolves about fulci who after being <UNK> by evil <UNK> is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the <UNK> and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some <UNK> from it's wounds forget the beyond or zombie 2 this is the <UNK> fulci movie now i like how fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the <UNK> movie he is such a brilliant director some funny moments and lines happens from time to time like one where fulci says making gore movies is kind of a sickness ending is very good considering that fulci and most of the italian horror masters is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes if you are fun of the fulci make sure you check it out if you have a weak stomach avoid this and repeat its only a movie ps some of the gore scenes within this movie chainsaw <UNK> full tongue torn out <UNK> torn out <UNK> <UNK> corpses zombies <UNK> face being in <UNK> water stabs in the shower to head throat <UNK> many parts of the body and organs being <UNK> aside hammer <UNK> face
<START> although it's been <UNK> as a comedy drama i found to be mostly depressing it's hard to imagine how spike lee could look back <UNK> on so much chaos petty cruelty <UNK> and mean <UNK>
<START> over the many years there are some films that just slip by hardly anyone views br br choose <UNK> is one of those films br br this small gem played at some festivals had a short 2 week run in a small theatre in west hollywood making all of about br br it is now on dvd i do hope many more will now see this br br it is a strange drama of a <UNK> <UNK> politician who influences a very bright 15 year old <UNK> this <UNK> also has a handsome nephew about 17 years old who befriends the 15 year old <UNK> br br the above paragraph is slightly vague as to what occurs so is the film that is what i appreciated we do not get all the facts much is left to our own thinking you will hear dialog that makes this logical br br steven <UNK> wings is our politician his role is slightly vague this is another point for the audience to <UNK> br br alex d <UNK> is our 15 year old he was about 17 when they made this movie but easily can pass for younger he has been in films tv since he was a young child he is a very good actor is quite convincing br br <UNK> <UNK> is the older teen this role is his first major part he too is excellent br br now i am saving the best for last the writer director br br luke is not yet 23 years old for a first effort a big thumbs up i do hope he as well as our 2 <UNK> have a long career br br ratings out of 4 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10
<START> pretty amusing spoof with great attention to detail re the look of the 1960s spy films and the way the action was staged back then the fight sequence in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a peter lorre <UNK> added to the mix of villains a big plus jean is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight plus his <UNK> deserve some sort of recognition for doing a great job br br funny aside the people behind me in the theater kept <UNK> after every plot twist as if they were watching a <UNK> spy thriller br br before the movie started a trailer for get smart was screened the preview made the movie look embarrassingly bad with lame attempts to <UNK> the jokes and gags from the tv series looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the <UNK> sublime jokes and gags of <UNK> <UNK> though of course <UNK> had its share of <UNK> the overall tone of <UNK> however was not an insult to the audience's intelligence and the material didn't feel as it had been <UNK> down ' i did get the distinct impression that if i understood the language i would have caught more of the jokes and one in particular the pistol gag was <UNK> in the interpretation for the subtitles
<START> any movie that offers bonnie hunt sarah silverman and amy <UNK> in the supporting cast has to be well worth watching and comic actor jeff takes advantage of the terrific talent he <UNK> for his 2007 directorial debut a sad sack comedy about an overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him familiar as larry david's manager jeff on <UNK> your enthusiasm plays james a still struggling <UNK> year old chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother his self <UNK> is so low that he can't meet women but it's the comical way he views his single status that makes his dilemma involving if the storyline sounds a bit familiar that's because the film is partially a tribute to the 1955 ernest <UNK> classic marty about a lonely <UNK> butcher living with his <UNK> mother in fact uses marty as the play which james is desperate to do since he is so <UNK> to the character's situation br br naturally there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version and silverman plays beth an off <UNK> sexually <UNK> ice cream <UNK> <UNK> who takes him on an underwear shopping spree their best scene together is in his favorite <UNK> store where they <UNK> different characters in different <UNK> hunt plays a lonely <UNK> school teacher who shares a passion with james for jazz musician ben <UNK> they meet accidentally in a record store and then again at a career day at her school where he hilariously exposes his sexual <UNK> in front of a <UNK> of first <UNK> including his best friend <UNK> daughter penelope played by <UNK> <UNK> look alike baby sister <UNK> in a <UNK> in cameo and looking quite a bit like <UNK> blank <UNK> plays the <UNK> <UNK> who speaks to james after his inappropriate monologue david plays <UNK> a retirement home manager and his scenes with have an easy <UNK> that makes their friendship easy to believe almost stealing the movie is character actress <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> <UNK> mother with <UNK> and heart br br there are also unexpected cameos from teen idol aaron carter and gina <UNK> don't the set up is funny as well as <UNK> played bits by director paul <UNK> as the <UNK> director of a <UNK> camera type show <UNK> job tim as the unsuspecting victim of that show and dan as the tough love <UNK> store owner with his <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and self loathing comic sensibilities resemble those of albert brooks and the casual dialogue at its best reminds me of modern romance and defending your life the one <UNK> problem i had with the film is pacing as some scenes dragged out longer than necessary the problem is more evident in the first half when is trying to establish the right <UNK> and the lack of real conflict adds to the regardless what he does well is capture that <UNK> sense of desperation one feels upon the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be that a significant other may be out of reach and that a steady <UNK> of junk food eaten on a car hood is the only sure thing when it comes to <UNK>
<START> i have only praise for this film from start to finish it captured the brilliance of stephen <UNK> musical i am not a big fan of musicals most of them are very overdone this one however changed my mind i am an actor myself and have played <UNK> and i know how hard this role is george gave a stunning masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards that we can give him he won an emmy and that's something everything he does he turns to gold he is so good it will blow your mind why he's not in films winning oscars lansbury is also very good and very funny sara woods is creepy and wonderful as the <UNK> woman all in all a great video pick it up if you can
<START> this movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then <UNK> your friends to watch those movies too if you're anything like me and you probably are you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie one of the funniest parts is when gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like <UNK> and <UNK> then he and his wife go home with them the soup scene kitchen is <UNK> with comic genius of <UNK> <UNK> officer here and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever probably when i have shown this movie to my friends they usually say what was that so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies <UNK> this movie is so <UNK> it's not funny anymore so probably the <UNK> way to get it would be online the first time i saw it was from a rental
<START> made with film stock left over from the production of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> un air de <UNK> is described as a holiday film for all concerned and that's the best way to view it jean <UNK> seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together the plot is a simple <UNK> of racial stereotypes  in a black <UNK> travels to a post holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the <UNK> naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a <UNK> to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of <UNK> music there are plenty of surreal touches be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hair the angels the girl <UNK> <UNK> and producer pierre among them or the fact that black performer johnny <UNK> plays his part in <UNK> <UNK> while dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion but there's not really enough to sustain it for two <UNK> an additional air of <UNK> is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions new <UNK>
<START> i had a different experience with this movie it never got charming or delightful or funny for me one big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the s spoken in the film another was the lack of choices re subtitles br br i found the lack of dialogue annoying especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was the wildly inconsistent development of the feeble plot was puzzling were there characters or only vague gestures was there even a plot br br on a separate matter i'm getting <UNK> to correct the spelling of dialogue with the suggested substitute of dialogue maybe this movie in its entirety including the imdb portion is designed to puzzle or <UNK> but i'm getting more <UNK> than amused
<START> this son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least you would think that production would be better 10 years after the original was released however retro puppet master was not directed by or written by the original writers and contained poor story lack of any connection to any characters and dragged out slowly scene to scene no build up of strong plot very weak climax you will find yourself slowly getting <UNK> throughout the movie if you can sit through the whole reel i never could understand why a horror movie continues making sequels after the release of their final chapter i hardly suggest watching this flick but if you must i wouldn't recommend making anyone else sit through it with you
<START> the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura <UNK> in all her glory br br that's reason enough for me br br she heads to africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films huge mansion near the jungle hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting <UNK> and said parties becoming drunken <UNK> br br all the high society types in the <UNK> films seem to have out of control <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> most of them br br joe <UNK> did not direct this one he just ripped it off and used the same cast s and did anyone notice the sexual images at the gas station and why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes br br <UNK> hardly any but <UNK> <UNK> is beautiful
<START> i actually <UNK> through the entire set of reviews searching for the ones which gave this film less than 5 stars they were few and far between which is utterly <UNK> yes i know it's a disney film and it isn't directed by christopher nolan but good lord this is straight to the bargain bucket nonsense they should've had done with it and animated the bloody thing br br and what's even worse is the fact that imdb won't let me simply finish my rant there because my review needs to be longer br br the awesome in game camera shots are literally taken from tiger woods tour golf on the <UNK> the story <UNK> like a <UNK> school boy the multi stranded character and plot development <UNK> an already weak setup and the grand finale is plain boring br br aside from that it really was the greatest film i've ever seen in my entire life br br good authentic looking costumes sets and sports equipment there i said it
<START> my original title for this review was going to be ending disappoints film <UNK> but i actually thought about this one on the way home it is not the fairy tale most of these films are it takes turns that are different and while its ending is at first disappointing it slowly sinks in and hits the core on a satisfying tone br br the plot follows a man named james aaron <UNK> your jeff who also wrote and directed a struggling actor who lives in chicago with his mother and deals with both his <UNK> and his inability to find someone to love br br yes it sounds corny but it experiments with elements that make it somewhat unpredictable and actually makes you wish it were longer the ending came kind of abruptly and had me saying that's it but once it starts to take it's <UNK> it really makes you smile br br it does have many tones of seriousness throughout but fear not for it is also very funny some scenes offer huge laughs and those who have seen jeff stand up will recognize a couple primarily when he gives a speech at career day for his <UNK> <UNK> class and bombs it begins on somewhat of a serious note that you do not expect but what follows is very funny entertaining and quite poignant as well it is the kind of movie that you keep watching and always enjoy and as i said before while the ending may seem absurd at first once you take time to think about it is a true joy
<START> extremely formulaic with <UNK> sized logic holes and a <UNK> at comedy <UNK> poor nyc lawyer he's just <UNK> by and when he gets a <UNK> in pay he doesn't go out to find another job though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area we see him arguing in court so that others come up and <UNK> him on his fiery winning delivery but he can't stand up to anyone in his firm at home problems are ignored until people storm out of the house br br the only character you want to root for is the final maid who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world how laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on new year's eve because she feels sorry for them the <UNK> not played for laughs br br sorry just too unbelievable and with a spoiler pat everyone turns <UNK> degrees ending <UNK> they get top notch stars for this if i'd been at the studio i'd have sent this one back for a complete rewrite
<START> william m <UNK> once said a good laugh is sunshine in the house when i watched take away i must say that the sun did shine in my house this film was superb the opening was very cleverly done the story held together well in a nutshell two chip shop owners who normally enemies are forced to form an alliance of sorts to engage in a david and <UNK> struggle against a fast food chain which builds a restaurant on their street the ending was hilarious even though i have found many who disagree with me on that one br br the film was though very <UNK> portraying contemporary australian ethnic stereotypes in particular the <UNK> or culture clash if you will between the traditional <UNK> australian and <UNK> australian stereotypes and how they found a sort of <UNK> though <UNK> very nice br br i found vince performance as tony an <UNK> australian fish <UNK> chip shop owner in his thirties to be first class his acting was very genuine and convincing through his performance he managed to really bring to the surface the essence or i should say the soul of the italian australian stereotype which in reality is not too italian but not too australian either found that balance <UNK> into its <UNK> and gave it life br br the cinematography could have been better more shots of the local area would've been nice from what i can see it was in melbourne but where in melbourne to me it looks like somewhere between <UNK> to though i am not 100 sure on that one br br i don't know why so many people are comparing this film to the castle though they have similar themes running through them take away stands in a league of its own br br i think the film was excellent with a capital e it has everything it's funny the jokes are great it deals with contemporary issues facing australian society the story holds well i loved it i highly recommend it
<START> best around the middle when most characters get horny and go after someone they haven't had before it is around this point that we get to see susan <UNK> <UNK> breasts even if through a <UNK> strangely enough beverly <UNK> who isn't shy about nudity doesn't show any at all while <UNK> <UNK>  of all people  does on the other end of the spectrum the less said about walken playing a homosexual the better the film itself has little plot the dialogs from the theater play and the normal dialogs cross over often and that's not the sort of thing i'd consider a good idea life in the theater who cares occasionally the dialog has something going for it but the film drags in stretches
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> story of a mysterious gift and how it effects it <UNK> in the past and present the talented burton family of five film making sisters an author mother and dancing dad offer a charming plot <UNK> edited for clarity <UNK> chosen songs and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry as the characters' invited me into their there was a farce like attitude about this work with touching undertones of innocent wonder
<START> the is one of the best love stories i have ever seen much better and deeper than romeo juliet or spielberg's titanic love <UNK> me every time her search her battle is exceptional <UNK> becomes a strong loving woman throughout the movie kay is the <UNK> of dark forces the temptation this story encourages me to fight like <UNK> for the only one for the love of my life for mister right patience is one of the <UNK> of this movie i cry every time when i realize all the suffering of <UNK> and kay and i wish that it ends soon tells although my life i deeply identify with the story and the characters thanks at least for hans christian anderson and the director
<START> well i'm not about to add to the <UNK> that's been about this film br br all i can add is that at no time does it even pretend to be a picture unlike <UNK> or 'the <UNK> all of which have very credible and serious historical purely for effect possible the worst of excuses br br has everyone taken a sense of humor <UNK> br br all i can add is a <UNK> from the good captain <UNK> looked br br fantastic and we have a bloody good br br one last point what me is that there are comments relating to the <UNK> <UNK> in a historic setting i wonder if the same people made the same judgment about <UNK> <UNK> i suggest not
<START> anthony 'the english <UNK> is a film that takes us back to the golden years of hollywood it is grand and impressive in scale and yet so <UNK> intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering at the 1997 academy awards the film owned the night taking home nine awards from twelve nominations the most <UNK> since <UNK> 'the last in 1988 based on canadian author michael 1992 booker prize winning novel of the same name 'the english <UNK> is a touching <UNK> on life love and loss <UNK> the history of a <UNK> burnt man in the aftermath of world war two br br during the war a man ralph <UNK> is discovered in the burning <UNK> of a crashed plane with his face <UNK> beyond recognition and with the man seemingly suffering from <UNK> he is assumed to be an allied soldier and is simply referred to as the english patient after the war in the mine ridden hills of italy a kind nurse <UNK> juliette <UNK> who has apparently lost everybody close to her remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man over time she comes to learn more and more about her english patient who is actually revealed to be a hungarian count de rather than losing his memory in the plane crash we learn that this <UNK> ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past both to protect himself from <UNK> and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love via numerous flashbacks we learn of former exploits in the <UNK> desert and his romantic <UNK> with a married woman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas br br it's certainly easy to see why 'the english <UNK> was so successful at the oscars it is such a beautiful film <UNK> the quiet beauty of the italian countryside with the endless golden <UNK> of the desert cinematographer john captures the landscape to perfection not since david <UNK> magnificent <UNK> of <UNK> has a film shown the desert with such beauty and <UNK> making particularly good use of sweeping <UNK> shots from plane even in the film's more intimate moments excellent use of close ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene coupled of course with the brilliant performances from all the cast members br br a long time favourite actor of mine 'the english <UNK> might just contain ralph <UNK> finest performance and considering his history includes such films as <UNK> <UNK> and 'the constant <UNK> ' this is not a <UNK> that is to be taken lightly his count de is initially a very sympathetic character but as we slowly learn more about his past his likable qualities are <UNK> by his less admirable <UNK> towards others <UNK> is a major theme of the film when asked by <UNK> what he hates most replies with <UNK> being owned when you leave you should forget me however as the relationship progresses and <UNK> perhaps tries to distance herself from him reveals a hint of arrogance <UNK> that his love for her somehow <UNK> him to have her whenever he likes i want to touch you i want the things which are mine which belong to me br br juliette <UNK> who received an oscar for her performance here is excellent as <UNK> the <UNK> nurse who fears to love because of the <UNK> that have always <UNK> those close to her after some time of caring for alone she is joined by a dubious canadian thief david <UNK> willem dafoe who lost his thumbs during the war and who suspects that it was who betrayed him to the germans <UNK> also strikes up a <UNK> romantic relationship with <UNK> andrews an indian bomb in the british army however due to her past history <UNK> is afraid that becoming involved with <UNK> will doom him to death particularly considering his very dangerous line of work br br at <UNK> minutes in length 'the english <UNK> wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old successfully finding a balance of mystery love joy and tragedy the ending of the film is heartbreaking and <UNK> but also uplifting in its own way whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning others have a very good chance of bringing happiness nevertheless in every case it is always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
<START> the <UNK> runner was beautiful poignant and very moving i particularly loved the two child actors in the film as well as the actor portraying the father it really made me want to go back and read the book again br br the music was a wonderful part of the fabric of the movie if there is a soundtrack coming out for the film i will buy it to <UNK> my second reading of the book it is also a visually stunning film the cinematography was gorgeous and really added to experience br br the brazilian word is very <UNK> of how i felt at the end of the film it is a deep feeling of longing for someone or <UNK> which is very sweet but also <UNK> with an <UNK> sadness definition provided years ago by antonio carlos br br saw it at a small cinema here for an advance screening i would love to see it again on a really large screen with a tricked out sound system br br can't wait for the <UNK> release i will definitely recommend the film to friends
<START> felix is watching an actor <UNK> his lines a ham a ham my kingdom for a ham <UNK> the dramatic guy that tells felix he'll have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies he's in tears felix just looks at him like he's nuts and <UNK> his shoulders the old guy tells felix to go <UNK> forth and find money to <UNK> a trip to hollywood felix thinks how does he expect me to get the money br br in minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a <UNK> sale on his store felix comes up with a plan to <UNK> him out and the man promises the cat 500 if it works br br well it does but the man wants to go alone and leave felix at home in an outrageous scene felix transforms himself into a <UNK> and that's how he gets to hollywood <UNK> himself back to cat when they get there br br we then witness <UNK> attempts at getting into show business his audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of charlie chaplin in addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives in all quite a bit of material is in this 9 5 minute cartoon it's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2 5 minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length br br at any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like felix have a sword duel with giant <UNK> crazy stuff
<START> it would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is <UNK> with a brief tale about <UNK> of hollywood people it was in 1988 that chuck norris saw this film at cannes international film festival he made a silly remark by <UNK> that the senseless killing depicted in 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his hollywood films with him as a potent action star he was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally <UNK> in <UNK> film by a reckless psychopath who hits him <UNK> with a big stone there should be absolutely no justification for violence and its <UNK> in a <UNK> human society this is the reason why chuck <UNK> statement appears as a cruel joke which <UNK> violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restless an honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if he she states that <UNK> film 1 5 has universal <UNK> this is because the events depicted in 5 can happen in any part of world the best lesson which gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just society this is the reason why the brutal <UNK> of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of in us we would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring arnold <UNK> chuck norris and jean claude van damme as they appear much too artificial one can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only <UNK> but make no sense to serious film <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> <UNK> of human beings in <UNK> fellow humans beings from the <UNK> of death and misery this is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital <UNK> have not been able to prevent homicide
<START> i chose to watch this film because i am a stephen <UNK> fan unfortunately i am unhappy with mr <UNK> choice to do this movie the film was slow badly acted and included some very graphic sex scenes of mr <UNK> character with a very young woman watch at your own peril
<START> i've watched a number of and sub <UNK> extreme movies lately and have found a lot to like about them br br this movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others i've seen perhaps that's because this is a comedy horror movie rather than straight horror and perhaps it's also because the humor didn't register with me very well br br it's a little less than <UNK> minutes long and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning there are some <UNK> goofs and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits roll br br movies do tend to be short and tend to feel padded out in spite of that this is no exception with some scenes that tend to go on too long br br the story involves a poor kid in california who'd been picked on by all his classmates he'd had one shoe stolen and unable to replace it he was dubbed due to an obsession with pirates his parents gave him an <UNK> for christmas with a christmas tree <UNK> on the <UNK> br br many of the classmates are killed and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do they're picked off one by one by who stalks around to the sound of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes like the nerd named etc there's an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex the woman is <UNK> and <UNK> the man wears a large paper <UNK> slice over his head this reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director <UNK> dream br br the picture quality is good and there are a lot of extras but basically a pretty silly movie br br oh well i guess you can never have too many christmas horror movies still there are a lot of other <UNK> holidays
<START> this movie is a very enjoyable homage to the bogart and other detective films of old robert <UNK> nails it as <UNK> and michelle phillips is a truly timeless beauty as gena br br however the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a hollywood film one well known professional <UNK> commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement br br the scene which ends up being an important part of the plot occurs in a <UNK> beautiful middle eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing the <UNK> music the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> finger free flowing <UNK> and beautiful costumes and a surprise twist involving the seductive <UNK> <UNK> build tension and excitement until the very end br br the three talented and beautiful professional nightclub dancers are led by exotic brunette beauty <UNK> one of the <UNK> leading belly dancers since the mid 1970s she was hand picked by famed musician guy to travel with his orchestra on the road guy's ensemble is the live band that the dancers perform to in the scene if you watch the trailer on this site you will see a glimpse of <UNK> playing the finger behind <UNK> <UNK> br br if you're not yet a fan of belly dancing you will be after watching this movie and if you're an <UNK> it holds up very well after repeated viewing
<START> another great tom <UNK> performance <UNK> separate lies a 2005 film also starring emily watson linda <UNK> and rupert everett directed by julian <UNK> it's the story of a married couple james and ann <UNK> where the husband <UNK> believes he and his wife watson are happy together an accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around it is a hit and run that killed their maid <UNK> <UNK> husband james becomes suspicious of a neighbor bill everett when he sees some damage on his car he confronts who admits he did it and promises to go to the police the next day when james arrives home ann is angry that he is making such a big deal out of it and states that she was driving the car of course james then isn't so eager to rush to the police she suggests that they call and tell him their decision oh f james says well that's just it ann says i am f ing <UNK> <UNK> is just the beginning in this well crafted drama without giving the plot away this is a good example of how gender switching changes a story example of what i mean susan smith drives her car into a lake and her children <UNK> she gets life in prison what if the father had done it the chair you'd be surprised how often the outcome would be different the same is true here if it had been james having the affair and doing the subsequent activities viewers might feel differently about the story if ann were in <UNK> place it would be shattering as it is it's tremendously sad br br tom <UNK> is heartbreaking as a man <UNK> by the woman he <UNK> and emily watson does a beautiful job as ann who once she <UNK> herself from her lies her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage knows what she has to do rupert everett as is very effective <UNK> <UNK> and ultimately in need everyone here is very <UNK> in their <UNK> with one another and no one is all good or all bad br br there are separate lies james that his marriage is happy <UNK> as listed above and there is one <UNK> lie the accident about which all parties keep quiet it's enough for ann that maggie knows in the end all must deal with the separate lies that the single lie <UNK> br br brilliant film
<START> the director has no clue i know that is the obvious comment maybe we should delve into the story the relationships how about the quality of the actors br br the story is well idiotic would be a simple yet honest answer br br the actors are they tried very hard can they be <UNK> for the director's choices br br all i can say is br br why was this made br br well isn't this an embarrassment to the korean american film industry br br should we be <UNK> about who we support br br am i being too harsh check it out for yourself
<START> it's a mystery to me as to why i haven't caught up to this masterful 50s caper film  turned brooding noir until now but i'm certainly glad to report that it didn't disappoint i haven't seen any of jules <UNK> american films for several years but based on this i'll probably be going back and re watching <UNK> force and night and the city quite soon br br jean a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its world <UNK> and <UNK> has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films hey there wouldn't be a story otherwise isn't <UNK> well with the straight life an opportunity presents itself an easy multi million dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men the taut filming of the robbery half an hour of total silence is what people most remember about the film of course and indeed it's pretty remarkable but i liked the half completed location of the final shootout once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves the excellent portrayal gritty sides of paris in stark black and white and <UNK> of both eddie <UNK> and <UNK> bogart in his spare but brutal performance br br perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or thought provoking george at turns <UNK> romantic and <UNK> score is another highlight
<START> in <UNK> in a world ruled by the <UNK> interests of the great <UNK> and not by the people will or politicians <UNK> <UNK> phillips is a human hybrid and international <UNK> of investigation agent she is a from sub human and her genetic composition is 80 human and 20 animal she has a combination of <UNK> of <UNK> that gives her strength and <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> her a <UNK> capacity of seeing and hearing and <UNK> that gives her the power of <UNK> in the first film she was a very seductive and amoral woman using sex to achieve information i do not have watched the second yet but in this third one the story is full of action a group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years the research has not been <UNK> yet when one of them betrayal the other and steals the research the problem is that due to its <UNK> <UNK> a black hole will be created and will suck the whole planet <UNK> saves dr tess <UNK> <UNK> the survival of the team of scientist and tries to retrieve the dangerous <UNK> from the hands of the bad <UNK> there is a very strong in this gang that causes many difficulties for <UNK> this action and sci fi television movie is better than the first one <UNK> the <UNK> in some parts of the plot <UNK> phillips is a very beautiful actress and her outfit is very cool i am becoming a fan of this good entertainment fans of sci fi movies will not be disappointed now i am trying to buy <UNK> <UNK> my vote is seven
<START> ladies and gentlemen may we present the worst of all disney remakes although the name of this movie is that darn cat it should have been that darn teen or fbi agent the cat didn't get any real good scenes <UNK> character was more annoying than funny doug e doug didn't get any good lines even dean <UNK> cameo role couldn't save this movie the only really good characters were the town's only two auto <UNK> but their scenes were only brief in all i'd say that if you are considering watching this movie go get something more intelligent like a barney video
<START> the movie is nice well <UNK> but no originality br br this movie is directly copied from the <UNK> where salman plays like a date dr like will smith and govinda like some fat jerk who is desperate to get in love with her boss by the end the movie comes to an old indian style the <UNK> father doesn't like the <UNK> lover and gets some other <UNK> and govinda the <UNK> lover comes in the end and saves her from the new <UNK> and a fancy dance and stuff br br the comedy was real good no doubt when the <UNK> meets hindi would be more funnier br br ultimately worth a watch but when it comes on tv after few months
<START> now really can u call that a movie i knew some of the movies that japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad i mean i fell a sleep three times at this movie no horror at all some tiny percent 0 2 0 5 comedy action let's just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly filmed the actors are pathetic none of the actors did a good job in it's own role the were not convincing the script is also awful i mean this movie may be great really but for the 60's in not 100 sure i recommend not to see it unless you want to get so bored as i did i can't quite figure hot this movie got it's rating it's over over over rated this is a personal opinion of course i don want to offend anyone but who could like this crap so i hope this helps someone not to loose some time enjoying this movie nevertheless it's your choice
<START> inherited this from my <UNK> dvd collection when he left with my best friend enough said watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly nothing new there then and got a very pleasant surprise very british you no hardly any budget no faces you know or have even seen before the accents were a bit thick for my liking but after a worrying start a bit too close to home in my case it began to grow on me apart from the some unnecessary <UNK> cutting that really didn't add anything i found the film <UNK> uplifting very real natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon highly recommended
<START> i like dark humor and non pc stuff but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself bashing a group of people without any trace of self irony is crap br br there are people who could make concentration camp jokes funny but whoever made this film unfortunately failed even in the very easy task of making fun about <UNK> in germany it is a very easy task but if your are the germany equivalent of an <UNK> redneck <UNK> <UNK> from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals you certainly will fail at this and also at life i have heard and seen so many funny stuff about <UNK> in germany but this movie this piece of crap being listed here is an insult to the next worst movie sucks like the <UNK> the makers of this movie met some years ago
<START> i didn't have much faith at the beginning but as a <UNK> citizen i can confirm that the movie shows the reality that we live day by day and shows a lot of things of our culture such as our way to speak our music our way of standing up for our rights without any fear without any weapons br br i'm really proud of the job they did and of how they didn't forget along the movie the message they wanted us to receive not caring for the money but actually working with a short budget letting us appreciate the beautiful scenarios and the great photography br br i strongly recommend seeing this movie you will not regret it
<START> back in august there was a country ish buzz to movies big hits like urban cowboy every which way but loose <UNK> and the <UNK> were all the rage for that reason i suspect the producers of this movie chose <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office <UNK> by drawing in that same urban cowboy crowd instead <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bombed at the theaters and i suspect it do so in part by being <UNK> with a poorly chosen title thats same problem <UNK> it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it's time no matter what probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy it br br its too bad this movie bombed but i think it would have anyway even if it hadn't been <UNK> with a poor title its a movie ahead of its time one could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or great uncle anyway to the kinds of comedy made today for its day <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of <UNK> about life that didn't get popular in comedy till much later on while clearly its a child of airplane its more mature and while its certainly no knocked up it clearly points in that direction the characters are more comedy mature in that they are low key and don't ever think anything they do is anything other than serious the jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situations br br but more than that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a real time capsule a great look back at the exceedingly early 80's the people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did it was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around them br br i don't know if my review is helping you but this is really a good sometimes kind of excellent movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger beverly <UNK> is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes so are beau bridges and <UNK> <UNK> terry <UNK> was just about to become the <UNK> of hollywood as her next movie after this one was <UNK> which finally made her a star howard was arguably the biggest current star of the the day when this movie was made back in 1981 howard was the star of the big hit tv show <UNK> in he played its lead character the <UNK> night dj daniel stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80's sitcom the wonder years there are also several faces that are no longer with us these days its nice to see <UNK> and jessica <UNK> as a an old married couple on a journey jessica <UNK> would finally pick up her oscar ten years after this for driving miss daisy there is also the great <UNK> page in one of her final movie appearances though she'd had a brilliant career she didn't get her oscar till four years after this in trip to <UNK> for which she richly deserved it and she died very soon after getting that award br br plus there are lots of other faces in this movie actors who aren't big stars but who have done tons of supporting work many are familiar even if you can't think of their name br br this movie is a pleasant little <UNK> a bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all in a vaguely altman <UNK> way end up heading towards florida and <UNK> to them a in the little town of florida which happens to be <UNK> from the effects of being <UNK> by the recently constructed <UNK> nearby which did not <UNK> an exit to which effectively takes the town off the map br br and thats also what this movie is about fascination with the whole idea of the <UNK> system which had only recently been completed it had taken a generation to build from when it was <UNK> by <UNK> around 1960 through many years as different parts were built and then went live and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the <UNK> system would be had turned into what is and people were enchanted by it everybody by 1980 was pretty much an <UNK> <UNK> veteran in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs only on and off <UNK> and that it went to places that were <UNK> less accessible by 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom and this was all new then br br the ending is anti climatic and isn't that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment what makes it great is it's the journey not the destination that makes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day forget its title instead let it take you down memory lane
<START> was this supposed to be a comedy the black cape and <UNK> mask are hilarious there is like zero plot the movie starts out with an <UNK> and his assistant they make a small mention of their dig site being cursed and then lo and behold in drops halloween costume man dressed in the shiny black cape with a <UNK> mask face holding an axe so he kills off these two people then we cut to the woods with a bad imitation of predator only the <UNK> are being hunted down by halloween costume man who is now riding a horse more <UNK> show up but these people are supposed to be disguised as a <UNK> group yeah production probably ran out of <UNK> costumes can you say low budget anyway they come upon a lone old indian guy sitting in the woods he's just too funny and he starts <UNK> about something but you really don't know what he's <UNK> about so they flashback to some indians getting killed none of it really makes sense and then we go back to our <UNK> where more of them get killed and that's really basically the plot it's so laughably bad you just can't really look away because you want to see just how low it sinks you could make the same movie with a camcorder a halloween costume and a bunch of your friends with fake guns don't see this thing if you want a horror movie if you want a comedy maybe or just skip it and get something like the real predator
<START> mr and mrs smith is one of the not too well known early american hitchcock's movie but if <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately also belongs to this category is an underrated masterpiece not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time the early 40's are really worth seeing and to tell the truth not discovering this film isn't really a lost br br mr and mrs smith is an average and conventional screwball comedy where it's rather hard to find the hitchcock's touch maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow <UNK> isn't much in the cruelty that carole lombard is sometime capable of but it's well hidden in an <UNK> package in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction and maybe in the character of the mother and that's about it even for the hitchcock fan there is little to connect with br br and for the screwball comedies amateur there isn't very much more none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny and we're far from the masterpieces of <UNK> for instance and if one or two scene are quite amusing <UNK> not even the funniest in hitchcock's filmography who created comical situations in almost all his movies even psycho could be considered full of very dark humor so there is really little to save in this movie that can without annoying anyone or maybe only both hardcore fans of hitchcock and screwball comedy who are in love with carole lombard stays one of the not too well known early american hitchcock's movie
<START> if you were enjoyed by watching guinea pig then you'll like this movie to psycho the snuff <UNK> is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements actually the effects are not so realistic like in guinea pig but its still pretty gory br br psycho the snuff <UNK> contains 70 minutes of sex fetish and then torture scenes first 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie after that you'll see fetish sex scenes and last one is a torture scene the guys torture and rape girl they cut off her legs hand tongue in the end guy rapes girl in her stomach and after that other guy beat him and cut off his balls sounds pretty sick isn't it br br like i said it's pseudo snuff movie psycho the snuff <UNK> is pretty rare japanese movie and as i know it's really hard to find it but if you are crazy about that sort of films i believe that you can find it
<START> i have mixed emotions about this film especially as it <UNK> to its <UNK> br br an american werewolf in london that film had it's funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else this updated version now set in paris does not have that edge at all and simply isn't in the same class but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch br br so werewolf <UNK> aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version i'll still give it decent marks since i don't care what others think i liked it even though i agree london is better and i prefer that version too br br the first 30 40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant it also introduces the lead female character played by julie <UNK> i don't see enough of this actress she doesn't seem to make that many films or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great br br when the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good i also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no f words and no <UNK> name in vain amazing br br however there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was <UNK> to me the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle aged guy like me either this film is <UNK> a lot more toward 20 somethings if that helps anyone br br it's entertaining just don't expect it to live up to the first film
<START> wow another kevin <UNK> hero movie <UNK> tin cup <UNK> bodyguard <UNK> <UNK> robin hood even that baseball movie seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention the characters are almost always the same the <UNK> the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption <UNK> within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie we're all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from there br br and this time the story story is just a <UNK> of different movies you don't need a spoiler you've seen this movie several times though it had different titles you'll know what will happen way before it happens this is like mixing an officer and a gentleman with but both are easily better movies watch to see how this kind of movie should be made and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor russell plays the hero
<START> the third film in a cycle of <UNK> brilliant exploitation movies and the third masterpiece in a row aka female prisoner <UNK> beast stable aka <UNK> of the beast where i live of 1973 is a film that <UNK> from its predecessors in some aspects but that equals or arguably even surpasses them in brilliance the entire original series with the wonderful stands out as the absolute highlight in <UNK> cinema and all of the films especially the first three uniquely combine exploitation and art house cinema like no other movie does beast stable is the third and second to last film with the last one to be directed by genius director <UNK> and in my opinion the greatest of them all the first film <UNK> of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of exploitation cinema and simply the definition of exploitation art in the equally brilliant first sequel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> added more <UNK> and symbolism the third film beast stable keeps up the <UNK> <UNK> not quite to the same extent as the second and features even more social criticism than its predecessors topics like poverty forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie br br this third film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the generally brilliant cycle to me it's this one with the first one as a close second once again best stable is both very artistic and very exploitation like the visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again as well as sequences of enormous <UNK> beauty the stunningly beautiful is once again brilliant in her role of <UNK> aka i absolutely worship this wonderful actress and i'm sure i'm not the only one to do so the rest of the performances are also great especially is great as a police inspector who is obsessed with catching the musical score is the same throughout all three films with <UNK> sung by herself as the main theme which is great since the score is simply put pure perfection as its predecessors beast stable is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of exploitation art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss the entire cycle <UNK> high on my personal all time favorite list beast stable is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all 10 10
<START> this is one of the most touching films i had ever watched no movie has <UNK> me the way this one did this is a great film and you have to see for yourself i'm normally <UNK> with these <UNK> story movies but this one did it for me i was in tears at the end you'll <UNK> for the friendship that is portrayed in this movie if i can give this movie a billion stars i could
<START> this was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god that is <UNK> i refuse to believe that studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the <UNK> <UNK> name ever since my sight became poor enough to require large print i have been unable to read this book as i had at least twice a year since first reading it i missed the book greatly and was unable to find it in large print br br i was hoping by renting this movie i would at least get my <UNK> <UNK> pleasures but this movie was a travesty because of subtle plot points it is my belief none of mr or most decent authors for that matter books can be <UNK> into 1 2 hours of film br br it will be the wise network cable or other wise who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multiple part television movie i e mini series of this book the right way br br one a star out of five would that i could go lower
<START> for me this movie was a disappointment somehow i expected that it would explain the reason for general popularity and his success as a military <UNK> in <UNK> ii but there is none of that it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries in a way to <UNK> him so i just have to suppose that <UNK> was primarily an amoral and <UNK> in the <UNK> and killing business without any particular charm or <UNK> in behaviour such real life people just do not make good movie material i almost feel sorry for james mason really one of my favorite actors who had to <UNK> a pretty wooden character actually a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie  with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> who gives a really memorable and <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> hitler br br there might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the german speaking world famous british actors <UNK> germans are just not credible <UNK> for example is perceived here not just as a german but as a typical from you immediately think of a certain <UNK> a certain kind of wit a certain way of seeing the world the total opposite of <UNK> a <UNK> i also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of july 20th many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not <UNK> and just wanted the german troops to join the western allies against the <UNK> <UNK> thus <UNK> the war forever br br the best movie portrayal of an intellectual intelligent military mind is in my opinion still <UNK> 1970 incidentally general <UNK> can be <UNK> for a short moment in the ample documentary <UNK> used for this movie a low angle shot while he is <UNK> passing vehicles the open <UNK> and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible
<START> being a long time fan of japanese film i expected more than this i can't really be bothered to write to much as this movie is just so poor the story might be the <UNK> romantic little something ever pity i couldn't stand the awful acting the mess they called pacing and the standard quirky japanese story if you've noticed how many japanese movies use characters plots and twists that seem too different so then steer clear of this movie seriously a 12 year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along and that's not a good thing in my book br br fans of beat <UNK> his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo and unless you're a <UNK> fan you don't need to suffer through this waste of film br br 2 10
<START> drivel utter junk the writers must not have read the book or seen david lynch's film not worth wasting your time br br longer does not make better while more in depth then lynch's film it has gross in <UNK> and down <UNK> key parts of the story br br a night at the <UNK> is more worth your time
<START> what a waste of talent a very poor semi coherent script <UNK> this film rather unimaginative direction too some very faint echoes of <UNK> here but it just doesn't come off
<START> like most musicals of the era one must check reality at the door broadway melody of 1938 is not remotely believable nor plausible but kind of fun in its strange way this movie is really just an excuse to <UNK> the talents of the stars some scenes just happen as if they were in a review not a plot driven movie br br judy garland shines and it's a pity she has so little to do unless much was left on the cutting room floor br br one of the most inane happenings are the way <UNK> powell get a lead role in a broadway show and robert taylor says it's going to be work work work from dawn <UNK> <UNK> several scenes go by and there's no work no <UNK> nothing she needs money to win a horse in an <UNK> she has no money isn't she getting paid while she <UNK> taylor has to borrow money to help he's supposed to be a big time producer he has no money anyway that's just two elements in this strange story br br the musical numbers are quite wonderful which saves this from being a total loss broadway melody of 1940 is much better as is broadway melody of 1936
<START> talk about rubbish i can't think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i can't believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish br br the front cover of the video box shows a <UNK> with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by it's cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a <UNK> <UNK> terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in but no a <UNK> island instead br br i took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i haven't watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldn't attempted it br br the biggest joke in this movie is the effects the <UNK> looked like they were home made and that <UNK> was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to <UNK> these lines and shoot on a island br br lastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through br br in conclusion i give this film 0 stars out of 5
<START> i've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and i finally did since it's proper <UNK> on dvd of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if i had seen in it the 80s but director his film <UNK> is excellent makes good use of the lovely <UNK> location and takes the time to develop the characters not just to have them <UNK> in creative ways a high note brad <UNK> music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans a must see if you like underrated horror films to describe it would be an intelligent friday the 13th <UNK> with some tasty bits of deliverance with that aside there are some really cool original moments like my favorite when a couple are swimming in a lake and the guy disappears underwater to play a trick on his gal just when you think it's the usual scare she suddenly looks to shore and i honestly can't spoil it you just have to watch it for yourself also the ending is just one of those that you just have to see to believe  it came out of nowhere and it's weird wild the dvd includes commentary by
<START> i had the chance to watch blind spot in <UNK> and i enjoyed it tremendously i thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that i'd seen for a long time one of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations the three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling they are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye the work is just great that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time the mood of the desert <UNK> everywhere and even the scenes filmed in the streets of los angeles or san seem to be a natural <UNK> of it the story rides you smoothly through all these beautiful settings to lead you to a bitter sweet ending being the perfect climax for this perfect journey the construction of the film itself is a master craft the skilled use of innovative resources like stills <UNK> <UNK> memories into the film will compare to those hand made pieces of work so rare and so enjoyable blind spot achieves to capture the essence of the desert taking you to an universal common ground where anyone of us can feel being both <UNK> and native
<START> i bought this dvd from <UNK> for cheap thinking it would be a typical crap straight to video monster junk but it turned out much better than expected there isn't really any criticism to say about it it's obviously low budget but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun it's very cool and entertaining br br there's everything horror sex a great plane crash and good characters and i'd say it's pretty original <UNK> it really doesn't come off as any other movie i've seen it has it's own unique look which i liked very much that's why this film deserves credit i look forward to seeing more of these awesome movies from the scare master brett <UNK> whom i've never heard before this one br br the dvd menu is really creative with <UNK> music playing over it so it's perfect just to keep it on when you're not yet ready to sit down and watch it it also includes some special features which are really interesting but we never get to see the director or hear him in the commentary must be shy this comes out of studios in <UNK> usa i highly recommend it to all horror buffs you'll love it
<START> <UNK> baron cohen is a genius and this movie is good although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv show it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments i've liked ali g since the first time i saw the material from the show i think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time up there with say peter dragon action and the blues brothers biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it dance and after this i will absolutely respect them even more for having the good sense to take this chance i have nothing really bad to say about this film it's very funny very juvenile but hey so what br br one more thing to mr g sequel please br br
<START> file this one in the how do movies like this get made ' <UNK> a seventies drag indie version of <UNK> ' adapted fairly <UNK> but <UNK> in a <UNK> unconventional black comic style the cast gives it a shot with christopher walken <UNK> in the <UNK> as and with <UNK> tierney rising above the dull script as pat the other actors are wasted as is the audience's time <UNK> jerk fans of this brand of <UNK> may like it though 4 out of 10
<START> four daughters begins as just another clone of little women type melodrama a single father with four <UNK> talented <UNK> daughters has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their <UNK> <UNK> what turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new hollywood star some critics say the first anti hero long before james dean <UNK> the big screen from the time the dark foreboding figure of mickey <UNK> john garfield appears at ann <UNK> lane gate <UNK> his self pity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast four daughters becomes much more than just a chick flick br br though garfield is the main reason to watch four daughters there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy hungarian born director michael <UNK> later responsible for such gems as casablanca and mildred pierce <UNK> certain images with his camera aided by cinematographer ernest of rebel without a cause fame that sticks in the viewers mind for example the <UNK> gate that <UNK> first <UNK> felix jeffrey <UNK> <UNK> on so <UNK> becomes symbolic of the shifts in <UNK> and affections by those who use it br br that garfield delivers the standout performance is obvious but the rest of the cast keeps up with him most of the way the underrated jeffrey <UNK> plays his role to perfection as the neglected <UNK> whose love for his <UNK> ann never <UNK> even when she's with another man claude <UNK> somewhat miscast as the father of the four coming of age young women gives a fine portrayal of a set upon <UNK> family head who gets lost in the <UNK> the three lane sisters already famous for their musical abilities turn into accomplished actresses playing their parts well a raft of supporting actors including dick <UNK> frank <UNK> may <UNK> and eddie makes it all believable br br how <UNK> attract is part of the <UNK> for touching the quick of the viewer's imagination ann is the eternal <UNK> even when she and mickey are down and out she always looks on the bright side and like so many caught in the <UNK> of the great depression in those days she saw <UNK> just around the corner mickey <UNK> an entire list of bad things that have happened to him seeking company in his misery from ann which ann refuses to do mickey expects to go out with a <UNK> of lightning striking him dead as he rounds the corner of life mickey has <UNK> talent as a composer ann has talent to spare as a singer and musician ann is big on beauty mickey is big on personality in a <UNK> sense of a way and the differences go on and on how all this is <UNK> in the end is an important part of the movie not to be missed br br see four daughters for john <UNK> <UNK> of an acting debut on the big screen the only time he was better came seven years later when he again <UNK> the film goers with one of the greatest screen performances ever as frank <UNK> in the <UNK> always rings twice opposite the equally charismatic <UNK> turner but also watch four daughters to catch important elements that may be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show
<START> i bought this in the budget department last week i had halloween and halloween ii already and since i aim to collect every horror film ever i chose this after all the 1st two were good br br this film is pretty intelligent to tell the truth it seems to create the correct atmosphere and has a nice history of michael myers it uses the old locations from the original and the main character is the kid whom laurie <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> halloween in 1978 br br the climax also is fairly satisfying anyways it is a lot better than <UNK> which frankly is absolute crap
<START> unfortunately producers don't know when to leave well enough alone or are into <UNK> to the point that every <UNK> of trash that hollywood <UNK> is up for rendering into <UNK> it seems that every sci fi action adventure flick must endure a sad list of follow up films and <UNK> is a tragic example the first film under paul <UNK> direction was a wild stylish ride even finding time for a little social commentary on what the dark side of bio tech is capable of turning us into this film has none of that aside from maybe telling us that drugs are bad for you and could make you do things you'd regret when sober <UNK> 2 lacks the vision the profoundly scary vision of what we are becoming and instead clumsily takes us on a boat ride into how nauseating drug dealers and their victims really are social commentary be damned this one really bit the big one for me if you don't care for anything but the <UNK> go to it my friend otherwise don't waste your time with this sour cake and <UNK> the first film's accurately <UNK> heavy <UNK> hot out of the <UNK> it's that simple
<START> this movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time there are almost no <UNK> in it at all there is nothing good about this movie on any level just more bad actors <UNK> attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat avoid at all costs
<START> horrible horrible movie i still can't believe my friend talked me into seeing this no plot bad acting unfunny scenes and very very stupid dialogue all i have to say is that this movie is the worst movie i have seen and it's worse than halloween iii which i gave 0 stars too so i give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10 well on here a 1 but you get the point
<START> this movie is not only about feelings and human emotions it is also about everything that could be but it's not poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying but this movie is delightful to be watched not to mention the amazing <UNK> <UNK> a great actress in france one of the best actually when the movie ends you can only feel sorry after all when something is truly great we want more well for another great movie by k with <UNK> <UNK> we can always watch la double <UNK> de
<START> your time and brains will be much better spent reading or listening to charlie <UNK> war phillip seymour hoffman plays the most enjoyable character in the movie <UNK> the greek and he plays him as a <UNK> <UNK> in the book is hard core and completely free to speak his mind in the movie he's not even shown as being equally important to charlie and poor charlie is never shown <UNK> blood which he did every time he visited the camps in <UNK> in short the movie is too bland and the history is too old for our modern time we don't really care about the end of the cold war and the defeat of the soviet union which happened in spite of reagan not as a result of by a well <UNK> group of people who were extremely willing to fight not quite the lesson we need to be hearing and seeing considering how well the wars in iraq and afghanistan are going as i read the book i kept getting that <UNK> <UNK> feeling except it was present day
<START> <UNK> 6 is an entertaining <UNK> if not an entirely successful one the ultimate challenge is of course worth the price of admission alone but once again as with a lot of the early there's too much filler in between the crowd pops for almost everything and as always giving us the reliable <UNK> team of gorilla the body having a face vs face match as the main event for a <UNK> was absolutely <UNK> of at this time it only made things that much more tense br br matches br br <UNK> b <UNK> w frankie vs the model rick <UNK> for a 3 or so minute match this is as good as it gets i wish it was a tad longer but what i got was pretty damn good <UNK> wins with the boston <UNK> br br 2 1 2 5 br br <UNK> tag team championship <UNK> vs <UNK> connection c w bobby huge pop for <UNK> match itself is pretty dull i often had trouble paying attention andre really didn't do much so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1 there is solid talent involved here and it's a shame they couldn't produce better <UNK> wins that titles with there <UNK> off the top crowd blows the roof of for the finish br br 1 1 2 5 br br <UNK> w jimmy hart vs <UNK> i got what i expected here a standard boring filler match with <UNK> doing his thing i'm not really a fan of either so it didn't <UNK> my interest much <UNK> wins with his sit down <UNK> br br 1 5 br br <UNK> <UNK> vs mr w the genius <UNK> pop for really good match up with sadly not enough time given to develop even further it really kept my interest and remains one of my favorites on the card <UNK> wins with a <UNK> to the post much to the <UNK> <UNK> br br 3 5 br br <UNK> <UNK> vs bad news brown huge pop for <UNK> nothing more than a boring <UNK> that does not know what it wants to be some entertaining antics from the hot rod but nothing else noteworthy for <UNK> painting himself half black and calling himself hot scott br br 1 5 br br the hart foundation vs the <UNK> record breaking but other than that nothing to see here <UNK> win with the hart attack br br 0 5 br br the barbarian w bobby vs <UNK> <UNK> average for the time it got but watchable nonetheless crowd was rather dead for it except for <UNK> <UNK> hilarious cracks about <UNK> food is more entertaining then the match itself barbarian wins with a nasty looking flying <UNK> off the top br br 2 5 br br mixed tag match dusty <UNK> w elizabeth vs macho king <UNK> big pop for dusty and an even bigger one for elizabeth who looks absolutely stunning might i add i thought it was ok it was lively at least if nothing that great i'm not a fan of so dusty and <UNK> win when she rolls up <UNK> br br 2 5 br br the <UNK> express w <UNK> vs the <UNK> crowd is rather <UNK> for this surprisingly decent no doubt but with these guys involved it should have been better the constant focus with <UNK> kinda <UNK> from the match express wins by count out when <UNK> gets nailed with salt br br 2 1 2 5 br br jim <UNK> vs <UNK> bravo w <UNK> jimmy hart <UNK> like an idiot brings out the american flag in canada <UNK> gets some solid for it too but that also may be due to <UNK> canadian <UNK> crappy match all around i don't care for <UNK> but that's not why it sucked too short in the end to really matter <UNK> wins when he <UNK> bravo in the back with the two by four <UNK> gets <UNK> for his troubles br br 0 5 br br million dollar championship ted <UNK> c w <UNK> vs jake <UNK> w <UNK> some slow spots but when all was said and done i had a good time two solid <UNK> giving it there all resulted in an entertaining match up crowd <UNK> gets during parts of it though by doing the wave <UNK> wins by count out jake has the last laugh by giving away some of his money much to the <UNK> delight br br 3 5 br br big <UNK> vs <UNK> w slick nice pop for the <UNK> too routine and too short to really mean anything in the end <UNK> was a gimmick i was never too fond of <UNK> wins with his slam br br 0 5 br br the rhythm blues segment was pretty much a failure crowd wasn't into it br br rick rude w bobby vs jimmy <UNK> for a filler match before the main event this wasn't too bad if it had time to get going more it would have been excellent for sure rude wins with the rude awakening br br 2 5 br br title for title ultimate warrior <UNK> <UNK> vs hulk hogan <UNK> <UNK> this one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd and the split crowd reaction for the most part warrior got a pretty decent pop but in my opinion it was a little <UNK> hogan <UNK> it completely with his it's one of <UNK> best matches in history with two people who aren't really known for there wrestling they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages i have seen this many times and my respect level grows higher for each one for their effort considering i'm not a fan of either even die hard fanatics who <UNK> pure wrestling can't bitch about this one warrior wins with his <UNK> br br 5 5 br br bottom line <UNK> 6 is an entertaining entry if nothing overly special it's memorable for the main event the location and the crowd but it's not one of the best if you ask me that being said i do enjoy it and i give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans br br 7 10
<START> an interesting comedy taking place on a train from <UNK> to berlin december 1945 one can't help to feel sorry for the poor writer critic who <UNK> his job and jumps on the train to berlin his ambition is to make a difference and to participate in building the new <UNK> europe after the war has ended br br i like the black and white format of the movie as well as the closed scenery of a train in motion br br robert makes a classic role in this movie if you're a fan of him this movie is for you br br the <UNK> <UNK> through his saying one can never assume that anything is what it seems to be is <UNK> several times in the movie
<START> i caught on the run at the screening room in new york and was immediately <UNK> by its true independent spirit starring michael <UNK> and john <UNK> from the sopranos cast on the run sets us up in a 24 hour wild ride in the city that never sleeps as we follow the <UNK> of an <UNK> sales agent who is suddenly dragged by his long gone school companion just out of jail in fact he has escaped from it and is on the run looking for some action and a glimpse of life amidst the great metropolis powered by great performances this movie gives us back the old feeling of 70's <UNK> with both characters <UNK> themselves as they <UNK> across town <UNK> into wild events and locals an to a certain side of new york that seems to be disappearing on the run displays great sensitivity and humour i predict it to be a cult classic that <UNK> to be discovered future viewers should definitely surrender to this <UNK> trip
<START> the <UNK> surprisingly are a big favorite of mine yes they might have been the original <UNK> rock band a gimmick that certainly has reached <UNK> in the 21st century however their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer last train to <UNK> believer i'm a believer i'm not your stepping stone and pleasant valley sunday are great songs written by good <UNK> such as <UNK> hart neil diamond king and john stewart while they weren't great musicians or <UNK> they had a likable screen presence and plenty of appeal and some of their own stuff was actually decent their t v show is dated stuff in 2007 but i still watch the show on occasion as a time capsule to life in 1966 1968 that magical and dangerous time in u s history br br however as we all know as a <UNK> of things to come for the likes of kelly <UNK> the <UNK> didn't want to be considered <UNK> and just puppets for their recording company despite their average talents they wanted to write their own songs produce their own albums and call the shots when it came to <UNK> sadly this turned out to be a disaster especially when peter choice of <UNK> <UNK> as an opening act was <UNK> due to his stealing of the show and heavy sexual <UNK> in his music compared to the <UNK> g rated content br br however the final nail in the coffin for the <UNK> until 1986 was the infamous motion picture head head was written by bob and jack nicholson while they were allegedly high on the mary jane the film received poor reviews and only made 16 000 in the box office today the film is a cult classic ahead of its time and delivers a message of what was on the minds of the youth in 1968 the summer of anger br br head really has no plot basically one to four of the <UNK> <UNK> from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason they go from eating in a diner to seeing <UNK> jones getting <UNK> by sonny to a western to being sucked into a <UNK> to performing at a concert and so forth the film basically offers up <UNK> opinions of what was wrong with american society the <UNK> bash <UNK> the war in vietnam american policy censorship the establishment and greed you have to read between the lines to see what the targets of <UNK> were br br the <UNK> spend a lot of time <UNK> up at certain <UNK> of the film <UNK> how they felt their record company saw them as nothing but toys for them to play with when it was time to record another hit album a scene where they are <UNK> 16 4 in the western scene could be a symbol of them against the session musicians <UNK> record producers and <UNK> who controlled their careers and the cannon they fire at them is their way of saying br br the film is truly a psychedelic trip to behold the flashy tie <UNK> colors the hypnotic concert and belly dancing scenes and the <UNK> imagery is everywhere the acting is actually very good but that's being biased as i like the <UNK> t v show a small soundtrack features the song and three songs written by the <UNK> themselves br br the film actually has some hilarious scenes on occasion although maybe they weren't supposed to be mickey <UNK> beating up a coke machine that didn't give him a <UNK> or his violent punch ups in the boxing scene i mean he was a guy who probably <UNK> no more than <UNK> had me laughing it up br br all in all this movie is an absolute must see for any <UNK> fan i think a lot of people will feel this movie is indeed over their head but for those obsessed with the 60's and society at the time will find it a great time capsule
<START> 1st watched 8 <UNK> 1996 <UNK> tim robbins very thought provoking and very well done movie on the subject of the death penalty deserved more recognition and publicity than it received
<START> this review contains mild spoilers but not enough to spoil the story br br watched sinking of japan or japan sinks depending on where you live recently a remake of the 1970's movie of the same name which itself was based on best selling novel this movie is a gem of japanese film making it appears that japan is sinking due to a of a plate to the west the americans predict that it would happen in the period of 40 years but according to dr a seemingly scientist it will happen in less than a year the japanese government isn't that convinced but sets up a disaster <UNK> plan as well as form a new <UNK> team to handle the crisis while on a trip to china to <UNK> <UNK> plans the japanese prime minister was killed and sends the <UNK> into a state of panic the <UNK> team is left to handle most matters and led by the newly elected minister of crisis management dr ex wife she turns instead to dr for advice and he has plans to blow <UNK> huge holes under japan to <UNK> the process of sinking br br japan would soon have to <UNK> with various countries and <UNK> them to adopt japanese <UNK> soon it seems that a lot of countries are reluctant to accept any more due to the sudden <UNK> of japanese in their country and the chaos that follows if this ever happens touch wood i hope <UNK> <UNK> will be safe she can always stay at my place <UNK> <UNK> the scenes of are really well done showing the havoc suffering and desperation civilians have to face in such disastrous times and the many faces of human beings surface arrogance <UNK> <UNK> bravery br br this is a really well made film the storytelling is solid with an engaging storyline and wonderful acting dr played by was done really well portraying a divorced and often mad scientist who kicks and <UNK> up stuff his frustration and concerns were very visible and that's a really good thing <UNK> played by gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> was also played rather well and has the most memorable line in the entire movie go watch it to find out and i fancy that she has a nice acting voice she plays the love interest of <UNK> played by of <UNK> oh i almost forgot she has really really long hair and there's also a subtle but background love story which is well written and if there's something the japanese do really well it's love stories br br one thing that makes this movie interesting is the technical explanations of the events that occur and if you're interested in <UNK> you'll have a really good time i know i did <UNK> i can see that they went to great <UNK> to make this movie's theory believable and the first few <UNK> displays and explanation were done rather well although you'll have to excuse the famous <UNK> br br ok now about the effects it's all about the effects isn't it after watching the movie with pure awe i must say that this movie has special effects that are on par or even better with some hollywood productions the <UNK> <UNK> the massive <UNK> destruction explosions all done <UNK> the opening scene is so cool the 1st <UNK> catches you by surprise mountains fall the destruction due to <UNK> <UNK> makes you cringe to actually watch <UNK> <UNK> heat up is a marvel then you see fall to the ground it's so sad however what i felt was one of the best scenes was the giant <UNK> scene which sees rescue <UNK> fail and people left with nowhere to run and no hope to hold on to the ending scene also deserves a mention wonderful stuff if you like effects you'll love this movie br br oh ya every good movie has a great song behind it the seriously <UNK> keep holding u sung by the super cute and adorable is a <UNK> with and it's simply lovely i feel it suits the movie really well and it shows that no matter what disasters hit us our love and strength would keep us holding on the disaster scenes are handled with orchestra music and at times silence a japanese <UNK> and really gives a sense of chaos to the destruction on screen oh and did i mention it's a really really really wide screen been going on and on about this movie yeah i loved it and hoping to watch again it does have plot holes but it's all <UNK> because it was just a wonderful popcorn movie not perfect but really well made i'd give it a 9 out of 10 i'm glad to say that the most expensive movie in japanese history is also one of their best if you haven't watched it you really should today it is a must watch
<START> that maybe someday people will wake up to people who can resist the urge to separate each and everything and who see the 60s for what they were people who can see that it was the individuals who made those times not the other way around br br the forrest <UNK> comparison is a good one both films look at the 60s but four friends is about human beings as opposed to caricatures <UNK> <UNK> deeply into the very thing that quite successfully tries to <UNK> and <UNK> as nothing more than a backdrop but while <UNK> files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box four friends picks up and <UNK> each toy thus <UNK> the lines between what you hold <UNK> and what you are br br if you associate romance with shoe polish you'll hate this film
<START> this is a great movie for all corey <UNK> fans this movie has a great cast of young actors a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash but all goes wrong when a security gets shot and they take <UNK>
<START> this movie is an amazing comedy the script is too funny if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh salman khan and <UNK> khan have given justice to their roles after 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this
<START> do not waste your money or time terrible movie bad acting plot all over the place really really bad acting man this movie is just plain bad i shut it off at 7 minutes the script is bad the directing is bad it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class yes it's that bad the acting is not convincing at all mind you i saw only 7 minutes of it how this movie made it to dvd is beyond me br br it should have been left in the editing <UNK> room i saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool i heck won't do that next time
<START> as is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and <UNK> it into a two hour film a lot is lost here director john <UNK> shakespeare in love takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off what we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow <UNK> br br there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic the cinematography by john <UNK> cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall winning oscars for both is splendid working with <UNK> the choices for locations on the greek island of are superb and the visual images that come from <UNK> these <UNK> locations in varying light are lush and beautiful <UNK> also uses numerous greek actors as the <UNK> giving the town an authentic feel the soundtrack is also terrific and the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> by the italian soldiers are marvelous br br <UNK> does an excellent job of bringing us the italian <UNK> and the romance which take up the greater part of the film there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment however by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold there isn't much film left in the reel and this <UNK> is extremely rushed and <UNK> while the battle scenes are well done subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater <UNK> are being made to keep the film from running too long by the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment is merely <UNK> another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on features br br nicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight when fight he must cage switches <UNK> <UNK> into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both <UNK> br br penelope <UNK> whom the camera loves gives an uninspired performance as in part this is because cage so <UNK> the screen but <UNK> just seems too <UNK> in a part that should be emotionally <UNK> and dynamic she allows the character to be <UNK> as love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right br br john hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor who knows as much about human nature as medicine however christian <UNK> seems a bit overwrought and stiff as fiancé br br i rated this film an 8 10 despite some <UNK> this is a touching film that is well worth seeing the photography alone is worth the price of admission
<START> after world war ii the crime in city <UNK> encouraged by the money from an army base just across the river in georgia got even worse gambling prostitution <UNK> <UNK> and the like helped an organized crime <UNK> in the city soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore this movie is based on the real story of that fight br br by the standards of the 1950's it was shockingly explicit although low budget that same small budget helped with the realism <UNK> location shooting a very gritty film richard <UNK> was marvelous as always and john mcintire <UNK> br br why this good movie isn't on video is a real puzzle
<START> it's a shame really that the script of this film had more holes than you could shake a stick at mixed metaphor intentional because kinski and <UNK> both <UNK> talented performers who are capable of great subtlety and nuance have wonderful chemistry together and the always provocative <UNK> <UNK> didn't hurt the mix either jeremy <UNK> would have been great here too if his character and all the other supporting characters hadn't been written as a plot device as for the main proceedings the writers just didn't know how to create the suitable guilty or innocent tension for <UNK> character instead they gave us confusion <UNK> and by the finale downright let's hope the viewers don't notice <UNK>
<START> man did this film stink it's obvious this film helped <UNK> hollywood's need to <UNK> out tired sequels to appeal to the masses first of all it came out too quickly and second of all it just didn't have the same <UNK> which made the original film so successful no new ground was broken and it turned into a rather mundane effort
<START> well ok i've seen wrath of the ninja br br it isn't something that i would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot it's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 swords of <UNK> i saw the subtitled version not recommended by the way it's easy to miss something and i didn't really keep up with it all it had some good scenes tough but in general it wasn't much to my liking
<START> walking with is a new and exciting programme that uses amazing visual graphics to display the living dinosaurs the information presented here is stunning the <UNK> in the series alter to get your attention things such as dramatic music when fights break out there is clear evidence here for one cracking documentary my greatest <UNK> to the writers directors and producers and not forgetting the other people involved if you stumble this video in <UNK> i suggest you buy it not just for the graphics but for the extreme efforts and <UNK> work the series has to offer 10 10
<START> that's pretty much all i can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 carol kane vehicle <UNK> belle isn't much of an actress and she brings no energy and <UNK> to the role of jill johnson the babysitter <UNK> by an anonymous phone <UNK> br br but if you're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas this movie provides more inspiration than anything you'll see on <UNK> or jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she's providing her sitting services searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going <UNK> in the night as she <UNK> around <UNK> and peers down <UNK> we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like roman <UNK> a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass <UNK> and the piece de resistance a self contained and <UNK> pond that feature a self <UNK> system br br because the movie isn't compelling enough to draw us into <UNK> fear we're distracted by the <UNK> of the house which isn't something you should be doing when you're watching a thriller even as jill is pursued by the <UNK> maniac we cringe because she's breaking <UNK> and messing up the <UNK> pond not because she's about to get murdered br br the movie <UNK> along as predictably as most teen slasher movies and the ending is anything but original by the time it was over i just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real never mind jill and the kids she was <UNK> br br 2 stars both for the house
<START> after watch this movie i was surprised that someone had like it i think this is the worst comedy i ever seen ever if you think you had already seen the worst comedy made wait for watch this crap not funny at all ok one or two laugh maybe but you have to be really high the acting is terrible and the story doesn't exist even if you like and i really do you will hate this movie ok ok you can see some nice babes some nice tricks and some beautiful mountains but that's all watch a porno set in the mountains instead because the acting and the story line might be better sometimes in imdb i read bad review about some movie and at the end they are not so awful but this one believe me is pure trash don't waste your time and money in this one
<START> as a parent of two girls 14 and 11 i have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at <UNK> first i am always amazed that the living conditions of drake josh <UNK> cody <UNK> <UNK> derek sunny etc always make most houses look tiny and <UNK> most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work paying <UNK> rent <UNK> or insurance bills <UNK> sweeping changing <UNK> <UNK> etc just walking in and out and down the <UNK> wide stairs that only exist on tv sets cracking jokes most of which involve lying and the hilarious results and <UNK> work i think kids watching these will have unrealistic expectations on how hard they will work and how <UNK> their lives will be second there is never an intact family always a mom or dad but never both who are always going on <UNK> dates but never seem to have any of the downside of divorce <UNK> support arguments again kids may get the impression that if mom dad get divorced there will be fun fun fun actually mom or dad are often not around if that helps the plot needless to say there is no mention of <UNK> forget specific religion finally there is a theme that troubles me there are <UNK> that are good in school <UNK> good in sports <UNK> two shoes as well the protagonists are not good at school sports or <UNK> but make <UNK> about those who are the message is don't be good at anything just be one of the <UNK> who blend in cracking jokes needless to say i give all these shows a zero and turn them off all the time and am just short of <UNK> them in my house
<START> it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it lord knows i have wanted to after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadn't seen before but wasn't sure why now after <UNK> for quite some time i know it's these characters that even now i still can't stop thinking about br br distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative who comes from the to live briefly with a well off to do photographer in the city in hopes to find <UNK> however it becomes clear that after the idea of being a sailor and his <UNK> <UNK> dim that he's really searching for something else some sort of purpose in his life br br through all this soul searching we are taken through <UNK> surroundings that are filmed <UNK> the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other and the look of face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face that scene in itself has to be one of the most <UNK> filmed pieces i have witness in i don't know how long br br in the end has his own demons too but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true <UNK> br br what the viewer is left with is lots of <UNK> and <UNK> for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second br br rating 10 out of 10
<START> walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years the script for james <UNK> sidekick is about as <UNK> written of a part as wesley <UNK> on star trek <UNK> and is played with about as much conviction br br on this show people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life everyone is <UNK> everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly that's not how life works that's not how people are this show doesn't take place in this reality br br the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her with walker everyone on the show including the bad guys act like he's the sort of hero that <UNK> and fairy tales are made of and time itself <UNK> to his <UNK> the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley <UNK> for the serious parts and the scriptwriter for bob <UNK> funniest home videos for the humor parts got together and wrote all the scripts for this show br br this show is for people who think that good always <UNK> over evil it's for the elderly it's for <UNK> <UNK> it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion it's for people whose drug of choice is their television br br i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years br br i used to like chuck norris but this show has forever <UNK> him in my mind i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show
<START> wow i suspected this one to be bad but now i find myself just at a loss for words honestly no words of mine can do this movie any justice br br i'll try to say something anyway br br this truly is one unique gem one of the worst kind br br <UNK> la <UNK> given his background as an actor doing a whip fight with a <UNK> zombie during the movie's climax a true stroke of genius without a doubt br br it rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone it happened numerous times with this one br br the accents of the actors man the accents and the dialogues i heard them speak and the acting itself i just couldn't believe what i was hearing br br that fat uncle <UNK> so <UNK> when walking up to the house together with his little nephew for no apparent reason whatsoever br br tits yes there's <UNK> and female ass there's even a naked chick in a <UNK> <UNK> a beer br br that one stretch his mouth over his face kill was the bomb a true highlight br br the comedy aspects were just totally <UNK> i just couldn't believe what i was seeing and hearing for a while i even thought that they were unintentional shaking my head in disbelief but about halfway in the movie i started to get the bigger picture guess it took me half a movie to dumb down half of my brain to finally get it br br i had a really hard time believing this movie but it's good really i think it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny <UNK> opening it and then saying look at all the <UNK> space and she said it like she meant it i mean that's good dialogue and good acting right br br oh and perhaps needless to say <UNK> la whip skills suck major ass in the dark power it's really sad and pathetic to behold that's all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes i'm wrong <UNK> la <UNK> was amazing with the whip it was the <UNK> fault he messed it up cutting his <UNK> together and all or wait it might have been the camera <UNK> he filmed from the wrong angles then why didn't phil say anything that's it it's the director's fault br br but it's a good movie br br i'm just gonna quit talking about it i have nothing meaningful to say anyway except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience some time soon
<START> all in all big bad john was a hilarious and touching movie if you want romance tragedy and humor this movie's got it if you're a fan of the song like i am you pretty much know how it ends but if you don't or do and want to watch it anyway i strongly recommend this movie jack <UNK> and jimmy dean are a hilarious pair with great chemistry however i wouldn't recommend this movie to strict urban folk you have to understand where these people are supposed to be coming from and only a handful of us are left but even a few urban folk might understand it and appreciate it for what it is a good down home movie that'll make you laugh cry and be inspired
<START> this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message but the message was a cliché hopeless mess to begin with this movie falls on shameless <UNK> point even making a self righteous point of destroying an <UNK> and promoting animal planet br br in sitting through this i couldn't help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line the only thing that could <UNK> mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to <UNK> sykes her character gets frequent cringe worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit br br far from the brilliance of bruce almighty <UNK> almighty blows its whole record breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of <UNK> <UNK> but by the end we learn that the <UNK> was completely meaningless and the whole plot was a just a <UNK> for the stupid gags and even <UNK> messages the movie concludes when we learn that the whole <UNK> <UNK> and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god yes god was trying to influence politics
<START> i saw this movie and i do like horror movies br br i did not know what to expect but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice especially jenna <UNK> as the exciting evil <UNK> br br the hardest thing about horror movies is to make a good ending but there the movie failed for a change a end scene in a hospital where suddenly all employees are gone first you see doctors and <UNK> running around but then they all went home br br no cries for help while being chased by <UNK> escaping to the roof also a smart move not and off course a kind of open ending br br no the movie started great the main part was nice to watch but they really messed up the ending using all clichés from bad horror movies jeffrey failed in my eyes with this movie after making some really quality movies like final destination 1 and 2 br br if you like a good horror full of cliché endings <UNK> is a good movie to watch for me i like movies which surprise me
<START> along with his turn in the super sleazy <UNK> the <UNK> murders 1978 this is considered the ultimate bad cameron mitchell horror effort it's a little too slow moving for my tastes has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end but <UNK> dedicated central psycho performance as vengeance minded <UNK> job vincent is fun not anthony <UNK> good mind you but definitely fun enough as a spoof of the shallow <UNK> that is hollywood it's only so so as a horror movie it's also only fair and even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture it's just ok i'm a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance sequence so i was also thankful for the appearance of the dancers who just rule five of them do a crazy hair floor hip <UNK> go go dance routine to don't cry look for the <UNK> by the t bones watching these ladies <UNK> around with huge smiles on their faces in their <UNK> covered bikini top and <UNK> pants ensemble is a defining reason why i give this a slightly higher rating that usual br br former movie make up man vincent the best since <UNK> <UNK> goes after people at <UNK> studios a flashback shows how max black <UNK> a jealous and drunk studio executive <UNK> wine in face right when he was about to light a smoke he's <UNK> in flames and <UNK> into a pool but not before <UNK> up one side of his face and losing an <UNK> not to mention his sanity now employed by the world famous wax museum in <UNK> park california vincent uses a special serum described as a mixture of truth serum nerve medicine and special <UNK> and <UNK> watch out to <UNK> victims they disappear and the dense detectives on the case headed by scott brady act <UNK> as new are put on display in the museum vince talks to himself i'm a terribly nice man chain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and describes how he gets excited by the sound of a woman's scream br br he also has to deal with a bunch of back stabbing <UNK> and self absorbed witches most of whom will deserve what's coming to them there is also nick <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> inept museum tour guide who sees a blink but doesn't go to the cops aside from max a real grade a jerk who doesn't even die and the stupid cops the other two lead roles are women and both are pretty atrocious marie morgan anne <UNK> is not your typical innocent heroine this tramp has been engaged to no less that five different characters in this movie including vince max and two of the wax <UNK> missing male stars i guess she never had time to make a go at the one missing girl for some reason she also begs and <UNK> in her irritating baby voice for vince to give her a of the head he's <UNK> of the <UNK> missing actor and fiancé number 5 tony <UNK> phillip she doesn't know that vince has already <UNK> a <UNK> in the back of his neck but i love it when mitchell <UNK> agrees with her demands so you can completely <UNK> for reality he also wants her to for him which means she's eventually held prisoner in a box unfortunately the box has a hole where her head sticks through so we have to continue getting <UNK> <UNK> by her high pitched <UNK> br br the other woman is <UNK> victoria <UNK> one of the aforementioned go go girls she's first seen proving she is thoroughly rhythm <UNK> by <UNK> on stage in a <UNK> green <UNK> bikini <UNK> is tolerable before she talks but when you realize her grating presence combines the of <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> mentality of the <UNK> sisters you wish vincent would <UNK> her with the serum as soon as possible unfortunately we're first subjected to a scene of her making endless demands to the studio head <UNK> and running around in the museum trying to avoid mitchell she and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic but function as a way to poke fun at the hollywood system in general i guess and i'm probably giving this movie more credit than it actually deserves the <UNK> are few and far between but include other than mitchell and the dance routine colorful slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that will be severely <UNK> for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell married to marie <UNK> now that is scary br br also in the cast are director john bud <UNK> also the production manager as a police sergeant james forrest as a film director <UNK> frye as a statue martin and kent <UNK> as a bartender many of the people who worked on this one including executive producer and script writer rex <UNK> also worked on the al <UNK> movie blood of <UNK> castle and other atrocities br br my score 4 out of 10
<START> screened this morning for the press at <UNK> film festival n e is easy to love first of all it can count on great production values as very few italian films nowadays can with wonderful settings and costumes the cast is great too director constantly speaks of the young lead <UNK> as a young de niro now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act i loved his performance and he did a great job with the <UNK> accent daniel <UNK> is a great actor and did very well as <UNK> it's really great to see him acting in italian i hope to see him working in italy again very soon the supporting cast worked well too people like or sabrina may seem unlikely choices but they all gave fine performances even <UNK> best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy tv reality shows <UNK> in well and was actually funny the low point of the cast was the <UNK> monica <UNK> sure she was slightly better than usual but she managed to look and sound utterly unnatural even in the part of <UNK> in which with a good dose of self irony she used her own accent the script by veteran and himself is clever with lots of laugh out loud lines and a few very emotional moments too sure the ending left me puzzled the message is kind of ambiguous the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else sometimes funny sometimes sad sometimes pathetic so that suddenly it's difficult to hate him then in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning personally i dislike very much this notion e is still a pleasant film the best presented at the festival so far the other being fur and the <UNK> my rating is 8 10
<START> spoilers <UNK> br br where do i begin with just how silly this movie was <UNK> sized people living under the garden attacking residents of a big <UNK> when i first sat down to watch this movie i was unaware that the protagonists where not etc but 10 inch high <UNK> that looked mighty easy to kick hard and far i carried on watching it because i like to see movies through to the end even awful ones this movie was terrible my girlfriend who went to sleep inside the first ten minutes apart from finding it a good aid to sleep thought it was hilarious that i had bothered to watch it all br br tiny <UNK> even in large numbers the thought is silly i know are about as scary and menacing as flat <UNK> they only managed to trip one guy up and kill a cat before they were blown up the end i did mention it sucked right
<START> similar story line done many times before and this was no improvement br br 15 minutes into this and you should pretty much be able to turn it off the ending was <UNK> <UNK> all over again br br the only morals i could see out of this are stupidity criminals do not equal success if he screwed you before he's gonna do it again
<START> not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula touching performance which drives the film into <UNK> waters and <UNK> the rather awkward storyline this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you've seen something special 7 10
<START> i've watched this movie after having seen the original <UNK> a few times in anticipation of the chilling ending br br i can't even begin to explain the anger and disappointment that i experienced when the ending came and went and the movie continued to have a happy ending what a waste of time it was watching this us remake br br if you have a choice please skip the <UNK> and watch the dutch original <UNK> the suspense is very well built up you feel the frustration of rex in search of any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend after she entered a gas station and never returned to his car the search takes him three years and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to he must agree to <UNK> the same thing that has <UNK> the ending leaves you speechless in your chair
<START> the movie had an interesting surprise somewhat psychologically gripping and the makers could have ended it <UNK> without making it just another of a <UNK> of movies put out by hollywood promoting homosexuality and or other sexual <UNK> this could have ended with a pay off but there were other motives behind the pen what me off is that the mud in your face after you've seen the whole movie like the disappointing the talented mr <UNK> yeah sure i'm just another <UNK> this gay content <UNK> the whole film i wouldn't positively judge a movie for artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose was to promote an <UNK> political motivation more so for this
<START> this work is pretty atmospheric with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements i found this work more rewarding than i first expected given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb the dialog comes across as natural and honest given the circumstances although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to cliché with the <UNK> falling down when they should be running and investigating strange noises when they should be <UNK> their doors typical horror movie fare br br the local characters are some of the worst clichés depicting <UNK> natives as in <UNK> challenged freaks the characters of the children and the principals are great the development given is adequate and <UNK> taylor <UNK> seems to be developing her talents quite well br br now i'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since <UNK> bread which isn't all that great by the way but this is interesting and i do not long for my <UNK> minutes back i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means but there are some really good horror elements <UNK> but there are also some really slow spots where plot character development seem superfluous to the director's or the film <UNK> <UNK> br br all in all this is good for a rainy night but not so good for a friday saturday <UNK> viewing br br it rates a 7 6 10 from br br the fiend
<START> have seen this movie today very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar the most sad things are br br 1 it's very slow br br 2 how khan cruel and mighty emperor of asia can be played by a kind good actor with warm and lovely eyes during all the movie except one scene br br 3 lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age we see an ex slave without money power friends or home click the very next second he's leading the huge army without any reasons to be a leader br br 4 the magic of khan <UNK> is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf god whoever it was br br 5 can a man make love to his wife that way after not seeing her for years br br 6 is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies does <UNK> scott know that way br br 7 why after 20 30 years <UNK> mother doesn't look older br br 8 what is the motivation for the main character none literally br br don't waste your time really work is good the nature is outstanding but the movie cannot be made without director and script the real khan would <UNK> director in a second br br kind regards
<START> thriller is the greatest music video of all time performed by the greatest artist of all time thriller really sent music videos going and other artists have been trying to copy thriller in one way or another ever since it's a thriller
<START> this film is a third rate attempt at a compelling moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts it just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the film br br but it's in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral a vaguely plausible <UNK> and that's being generous becomes completely <UNK> as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and events are never explained br br this wouldn't be quite so bad if the scripting wasn't so cheesy the acting so wooden despite a strong british cast and the direction so uninspiring this is not an example of good british film making nor indeed should it make tarantino bat an <UNK> at least not in comparison to his earlier work br br my advice in this case if it's hard to get hold of don't waste the effort if you're a brit like me and it's in your local video shop steer well clear perhaps head to the video entitled american beauty now that's an example of great british direction
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> park got corman <UNK> as usual the plot is <UNK> thin from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that <UNK> 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are to inexplicable science which uses <UNK> to keep the dinosaurs in check and <UNK> <UNK> which have <UNK> loose in <UNK> large enough for big dogs i've seen chicken <UNK> they are all in <UNK> the size of shoe boxes and all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of a film all the male actors are <UNK> thinking a <UNK> might be loose in the desert constantly dropping items to give the <UNK> an easy kill and the female actors all look like they just came from a <UNK> shoot for of hollywood the <UNK> itself is the worst thing since the hobgoblins from the movie of the same name it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the motion shots if you want a good movie to sit around and <UNK> mst3k style this is gold if you want competent film making and good acting don't watch a roger corman film acting gets a 4 out 10 some of the players upon this stage did try story gets a 2 out of 10 it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad special effects gets a 2 out of 10 i've seen worse but not many
<START> this movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver he meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss an obvious idiot a fat boy who never speaks and a woman who <UNK> between the three of them the group which is called <UNK> angels wants rod the driver as their personal driver he says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them they rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot missing scene the scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a <UNK> and large <UNK> glasses on she says she wants protection and wants the <UNK> to load the gun to show her how she then takes it from the <UNK> and shoots him the other three in the gang <UNK> rod run into the store they take everything off the walls and then proceed to play with it like children receiving their toys on christmas day br br this movie surely wastes no precious screen time with a plot
<START> i first saw this film on hbo around 1983 and i loved it i <UNK> all of the <UNK> web sites to buy the vhs copy this is a very good suspense movie with a few twists that make it more interesting i don't want to say too much else because if you ever get a chance to see it you'll be glad i didn't say too much
<START> my first thoughts on this film were of using science fiction as a bad way to show naked women not a brilliant story line it had quite a good ending
<START> spoilers whatever else can or can't be said about it surface is superbly crafted the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not state of the art <UNK> the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy and or fx fans close encounters of the third kind by way of creature from the black <UNK> with a bit of jaws and godzilla thrown in for good measure say and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting wise either some surprisingly solid casting here this series <UNK> seemingly from out of nowhere and by sheer <UNK> of its straightforward storytelling carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season all things considered a job very well done i only hope it <UNK> next season
<START> on one <UNK> evening at 10 <UNK> my local west coast abc <UNK> aired the pilot episode of northern exposure the abc network usually <UNK> men in trees in that time <UNK> but the program was <UNK> for a live sporting event br br despite both shows are set in <UNK> and filmed on location in the pacific <UNK> exposure in washington state trees in <UNK> <UNK> re watching northern exposure as well as few episodes of sex and the city reminds me how disappointed i am with the poorly conceived hybrid men in trees br br anne <UNK> can be a good actress with the right material unfortunately her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in <UNK> <UNK> on my nerves perhaps because i feel that <UNK> is miscast i am not convinced of her fish out of water character br br i also cannot help but feel that the supporting cast fits the typical quirky stereotypes the hot looking local the kindly bar owner the bush pilot the local police officers the dim but well <UNK> radio dj etc br br the only stereotype that may have been broken was teddy bear and veteran er actor abraham as the local bartender in love with two different women considering that one of the executive producers is filmmaker james his movies heavy and cop land had lead characters who were large men then i am not surprised why was cast in a non typical role br br nonetheless i can see why there are a lot of dedicated viewers who love men in trees it fits the quirky <UNK> for television audiences i wished the show could find its own voice instead of <UNK> ideas from better shows
<START> the plot was not good br br the special effects weren't br br the acting was not very good at all br br like others i felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly well a space <UNK> through br br i thought the ending was rather unbelievable br br by the way guys about the blow torch in space br br blow <UNK> have their own supply of <UNK> hence the name <UNK> <UNK> torch two <UNK> run from the torch one to an <UNK> bottle and one to an <UNK> bottle br br so a blow torch would work just fine in space
<START> i have to admit that i am disappointed after seeing this movie i had expected so much more from the trailers the movie was absolutely horrible it lacked a real story line and the acting was not exactly the best don't waste your time the movie is not what the trailers lead you to think it is i would have to say that i don't usually write anything about movies on imdb in fact this is my first one but this movie was such a disappointment that i <UNK> just to let people know not to waste their time or money the story line is that of a heist that is to happen and it looks like it had potential to be good but the things that happen in the movie are a little far fetched to be believable watch another movie instead maybe the inside man
<START> is a really well done 6 hour drama about drugs circa 1987 it tells three stories in parallel about how <UNK> is grown in north east <UNK> how drugs are <UNK> from <UNK> into europe and finally how people addicted to drugs spiral out of control all three stories are told realistically and with empathy you see enough of the characters lives to understand how ordinary people can get sucked into a life that is really <UNK> br br these aren't card board <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is trying to feed his family in a dry area filled with guns and other <UNK> <UNK> the drug <UNK> is a rich german with no heart but his wife one of the three main characters is just an ordinary woman who has to choose between leading her life the old way or giving up finally the main character the government minister has the <UNK> role as he must deal with the emotional <UNK> caused by his own daughter she slips into the world of drug addiction and starts stealing suffering from ill health attacking her parents emotionally all so she can continue to satisfy her <UNK> for the drug heroin that is destroying her life br br is one of the best dramas i have ever seen on tv the scenes in this show will remain with you for a long long time highly recommended colin
<START> i kept waiting for this film to improve but this is the worst kind of <UNK> movie a <UNK> sugar <UNK> that sinks under the weight of its own <UNK> self importance the pace stumbles on like a <UNK> stranded in the <UNK> the absence of good dialogue leaves the appealing stars with little to do other than look good in white <UNK> <UNK> plays yet another <UNK> <UNK> who's had a touch of the sun is a pleasing singer but not much of an actress luckily the script does not often call on her to <UNK> away from the jazz club <UNK> all the <UNK> relaxed pretty unnecessary characters take turns <UNK> the scenery with an air of weary sophistication the whole exercise comes across like an <UNK> long ralph lauren ad br br if you're past forty and believe is the key to sophistication you may well mistake this piece of cardboard for a <UNK> well if you liked this movie you probably felt smart for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> and you may even have sat through le divorce without cringing
<START> 20 years ago dr <UNK> yes he is driving a <UNK> as well as <UNK> people up disappeared when the police found dead bodies at his clinic since then people have been disappearing around lake or something and dead bodies parts of bodies has been found all over the place turns out dr <UNK> needs body parts to stay alive and has been taking them from strangers like pair of lesbians and 5 <UNK> girls on their <UNK> you get the picture traveling through lake when a bunch of teenagers decide to go camping they are bound to clash with the doctor br br well if you wanna waste some time this is the right choice acting <UNK> from really bad to mediocre with the girls <UNK> and falling all the time for no apparent reason every chance of showing skin is taken but without actually showing anything at all the same goes for the special effects who are pretty pathetic with every slash filmed in an angle so you cant see it but there are a lot of body parts in the movie all <UNK> in blood probably to cover up how sad they really look the plot is pretty <UNK> and dialog rather sad only time i laughed was when dr <UNK> said <UNK> when trying to be scary don't watch this one if your not a freak even then i would recommend you to watch something better
<START> this was a first feature for <UNK> i was there while he shot this mess back in <UNK> around 98 br br although i wasn't involved directly in the production i was witness to the typically <UNK> behavior post set that went down the parties the drugs the <UNK> <UNK> really an example of what not to do when making a film but also a <UNK> of young talented people getting caught up in classic <UNK> of fame <UNK> position br br i like <UNK> we had a curious friendship he deserves to have another crack with a more mature script there the problems lay and i'm sure a much better job will be done if there's a next time round because frankly he certainly didn't do himself any <UNK> with this on his <UNK> and neither did the cast but hey it was a paying job in country where actors regularly <UNK> to death br br in summary fascinating to watch 'the making <UNK> basically not so much fun to experience alas
<START> this movies <UNK> my will to live why this abomination isn't the bottom 100 list i don't know br br my life was saved by the healing power of danny <UNK> br br worst movie ever i dare you watch it's like a 90 minute collect calling commercial only much much worse i rather watch the blue screen it's that bad really
<START> the notion of marital <UNK> portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it is exactly the main characters' <UNK> to that notion which makes the entire story so <UNK> tragic it is this notion that them and allows them to stand out to as they refer to their respective <UNK> not be like them br br as tony <UNK> said in the film love just happens there doesn't need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens it simply does despite their not wanting to <UNK> to their respective level it happened <UNK> social <UNK> and timing all <UNK> against this relationship coming into <UNK> simply being in love is far from enough br br i had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and <UNK> to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross inability to <UNK> the <UNK> and the deeper emotions <UNK> made me realize just how much a film such as this as well as other wong <UNK> <UNK> work is wasted on the local audience
<START> this movie was disappointing after 15 years when it was brought back to mind from reviewing some info about <UNK> <UNK> all the regrets i felt about the movie came rolling back while i remember peter o'toole i was entirely oblivious to the fact that the female lead okay she was little more than an object for discussion in the storyline was ms <UNK> i saw this movie back in the days when i wrote movie reviews and warned people off it as the stories just didn't work and fifteen years of my <UNK> trying to sort things out still hasn't made sense of the flow of the ideas br br part of this may have to do with the fact that it looked like after the original movie whatever it was about was filmed an editor came in and tried to piece together something out of it i don't know if this had been a project of a previous studio boss and so was <UNK> to <UNK> him or her by the <UNK> or this was a disaster from the original screenplay that attempts to salvage were <UNK> the theatrical version just didn't work
<START> i think every critic who <UNK> tommy boy when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all every critic <UNK> chris <UNK> and david <UNK> movies yes <UNK> was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and black sheep i agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made but tommy boy does not fall in the category of <UNK> which could have been a little funnier and black sheep which is a piece of tripe it is very funny and entertaining i do agree with the critics that chris <UNK> was no john belushi or john candy as he claimed to have <UNK> those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but chris <UNK> was very funny and i wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no john belushi or john candy but he was very funny the scenes between <UNK> and spade as nemesis are side splitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious it is very sad that chris <UNK> is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like tommy boy to remember how truly funny he was tommy boy is one of the 1990's best comedies
<START> whoever <UNK> this piece of <UNK> with a title like <UNK> deserves some kind of award there are dozens of <UNK> here like who conceived such a dire project who <UNK> it who cast it who <UNK> vanessa redgrave to share even one scene with <UNK> jones and so on the most sane voice connected to the whole belongs to the person who decided very very wisely that this was <UNK> and not even good enough to go straight to video dvd which throws up yet one more <UNK> why if we rule out serious did the mail on sunday get involved and <UNK> to give it away this has golden turkey written all over it and <UNK> of being shot in two days in <UNK> garage and <UNK> on to some library footage of london except somehow you know that someone actually did shoot this on location when it would have been <UNK> to shoot him herself <UNK> jones and julie cox are not even cardboard <UNK> more like <UNK> paper and i swear pete and kate moss couldn't have done worse whilst derek <UNK> is a grotesque joke and the plot moves with the speed of the irish team <UNK> up the <UNK> run apart from that
<START> the above line sums it up pretty good the best <UNK> of the comics are it's visual gags and word jokes the latter of which are almost impossible to translate which is why the comics are at their best in their original language br br both are quite hard to capture in film which is why those will never be as good as the comics movies are simply a different medium than comics with that in mind this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic br br the word gags are bearable and sometimes even funny does an <UNK> reference i have to mention that i watched the french version if you don't watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles the word jokes will probably suck br br the slapstick is okay as well it's a very simple form of humor and not really funny when you're older than twelve but it captures the spirit of the the other visual jokes are the movie's saving grace for the older audience as their often quite funny br br the acting is totally over the top but again that's not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the only depardieu and <UNK> don't really <UNK> which might be the reason some people think they didn't enjoy their roles i didn't notice a thing on the other hand and especially claude rich turn overacting into an it's actually fun to watch again i fear it wouldn't be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed br br overall not a bad movie at all much better than the previous one it's not a classic and it doesn't <UNK> the twelve tasks of <UNK> as my favourite <UNK> movie but it's still worth seeing the french version that is 7 10
<START> that's what i kept asking myself while watching this film i mean the amount of nudity and sex was one thing but another part of the movie which gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of storyline really i just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie but i <UNK> i <UNK> in the hope that maybe the storyline would get better that there might be a good twist at the end however i couldn't have been more wrong in the end i <UNK> because i figured i could write a bad review for it if anything after watching it br br i mean don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with beautiful sexy and vibrant women but when the director only shows that along with a <UNK> story thinking it's what the viewer wants to see it insults us all to think we are all so shallow to only want to see <UNK> from <UNK> big movie industry players is preposterous my advice hire a different movie
<START> the <UNK> has happened having first witnessed it a few years ago i have had a film that has been my <UNK> for awfulness and that film was called island a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones i'm not making this up it <UNK> to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on like new schools or cancer treating drugs however for sheer and <UNK> levels of crap any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to <UNK> guest house <UNK> to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch br br based loosely around the <UNK> but amusing tv show bottom this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable richard is a hotel manager as <UNK> as anyone you can imagine and so <UNK> as to almost <UNK> <UNK> from every action his buddy eddie director adrian is an alcoholic waste of human life and together they try to run <UNK> worst hotel <UNK> upon a cliff top next to a nuclear power station between them they <UNK> in <UNK> violence with sound effects at regular <UNK> steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare <UNK> at any woman at all the plot such as it is involves the arrival of <UNK> italian screen <UNK> gina vincent <UNK> who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house <UNK> much to the <UNK> of <UNK> and eddie and that's it br br i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy we've had films like <UNK> 28 days later four <UNK> and a funeral and the brilliant shaun of the dead also starring simon pegg but this this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara top flying off with the aid of a <UNK> <UNK> guest house <UNK> is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it i kept watching waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came just an endless stream of trapped <UNK> gags unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation slightly amusing violence with <UNK> pans and <UNK> doors and almost nothing raising so much as a <UNK> come the first ad break it was on tv you see and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you my readers kept me going i'm watching this so they don't have to became my <UNK> so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force fed dog food br br trust me i used to love the bottom tv show the combination of suitably <UNK> acting from and with <UNK> juvenile humour worked for half an hour every week certainly not for an hour and a half as and <UNK> themselves in their little private joke and bore and <UNK> the rest of the audience honestly this makes <UNK> drop dead fred seem like the godfather and should you happen to meet either of these two people who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie feel free to <UNK> deliver a boot to their <UNK> region they'd probably enjoy it pegg and bill <UNK> both as guests at the hotel are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived and should not be so lucky the movie equivalent of and should be avoided as such

<START> this is a good family movie with a few laughs i wish it didn't have too much of the school stuff like the bully in it to fill the movie up also it seems a little too easy to save a piece of land from being built i mean the it just <UNK> too easily it does make you aware of the <UNK> it had a cute way of introducing the piece of land which the fast runner but a little too slow for me a little too hokey for me and it reminded me of going back to school oh the dvd is chock full of <UNK> so don't miss out 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out 10 for the dvd with the extras that is well worth to watch well worth your time to see this
<START> an <UNK> descent into psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the truthful brutality and suffering of war into your cerebral in a way not many other films will in fact there is simply no other war film like it br br director <UNK> <UNK> witnessed the <UNK> horror of <UNK> first hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped he has said that from that day it would always be his mission to express the pointless empty violence humans <UNK> on each other and themselves br br mr <UNK> shows us that there are no winners in war for the paths to victory and defeat are <UNK> with the same soldiers <UNK> down roads which only have death and destruction at their end br br mr <UNK> succeeds in bringing his message to the world thru this haunting piece of cinema
<START> vincenzo a man that has spent years working at a steel mill as a <UNK> man that the italian owners are selling to the chinese comes at the end of the meeting where the purchase is being arranged because he wants to tell the new <UNK> of a flaw he has discovered and he thinks he has the solution he doesn't exactly <UNK> himself to the italian old management or to the new chinese owners he even fights with the <UNK> about the exact term he wants to use in expressing his concern br br the next thing we see is vincenzo arriving in china trying to contact the new owners to his <UNK> there is someone new in charge as mr chong the man he tried to warn in italy has been fired his next quest is getting to the woman that was the <UNK> liu he finds her working in a library but she tells him in no uncertain terms she blames him for being fired from her position liu who sees the desperation of vincenzo agrees to <UNK> him to find his steel mill plant br br thus vincenzo and liu begin a voyage through some of the bleak countryside that involves traveling by train <UNK> bus and truck to remote parts of the giant country finding the correct factory proves to be <UNK> at best but vincenzo discovers a life that is completely alien to him as well as finding a kind soul who doesn't hesitate to help the italian man in spite of her initial <UNK> for him br br <UNK> film is a sort of <UNK> he takes the viewer into unknown territory some comments compare vincenzo to <UNK> <UNK> the great italian <UNK> although the similarities are not quite <UNK> the film keeps our attention in the early stages of the trip but it starts getting somewhat less enjoyable as vincenzo gets stranded after <UNK> from liu mr is an interesting director as he clearly demonstrates with this film for which he worked on the adaptation of <UNK> novel which we haven't read br br sergio <UNK> is the sole reason for watching the film this versatile actor brings a lot to the movie which in a way is a tour de force for him as he is seen in almost every frame of the picture the combination of and <UNK> proves to be a winning combination <UNK> <UNK> who is making her debut as liu has some lovely moments and shows good chemistry with her co star br br <UNK> photographed the chinese landscape in all its <UNK> we see a china that is not picture post card pretty mr captures all the so typical of the areas where the film is set franco musical score serves the film well
<START> i liked most of the dialogue i liked the cast i thought it was well acted i particularly enjoyed ellen perfect deadpan performance br br what didn't work for me was 1 the drawn out affair with the younger man too long too seemingly out of character for helen 2 the seemingly endless cinematic cliches mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re <UNK> of the love letter itself its <UNK> should have a mystery 3 a young woman feminist <UNK> and ironically a fireworks scene no wonder this reminded me of that horrid how to make an american <UNK> movie 4 the bumbling <UNK> cop who <UNK> <UNK> everywhere no cliche there either and 5 a <UNK> <UNK> small town setting br br i would have preferred the film to more <UNK> explore the source of or even <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to have included much more of character to have eliminated or reduced the various <UNK> <UNK> and to be a little less <UNK> of small town life br br had it been developed as a play first those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre
<START> i am a talent manager i have been for 15 years now i have discovered some wonderful talent they have been in movies <UNK> and television in my opinion eddie monroe was cast wonderful i love seeing the ability of real people not just a name the actors in this movie were very natural and believable i was very entertained by this film i love a movie with a few twists i also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved i still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money when you see the flick you will understand what i am saying the <UNK> all look real i would like to see this film on the big screen the footage was shot really well the scenery of new york was the new york that i know have a happy 2006 and may this movie make it to the awards
<START> i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan stand point br br i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear how wrong was i br br the main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to <UNK> along with a nice helping of supernatural goings on sword fights and the like br br you got some gore but everything else was just pretty life less the middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a <UNK> forest with slow plodding horse drawn <UNK> and even slower dialogue and character development br br on the plus side costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interest br br i think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the <UNK> and go for a <UNK> rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the film br br or go really art house with tone direction etc but that's fairly high risk as far as box office is concerned br br oh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it
<START> steven seagal has made a really dull bad and boring movie steven seagal plays a doctor this movie has got a few action scenes but they are poorly directed and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie a group of american nazis spread a lethal virus which is able to wipe out the state of montana wesley seagal s character tries desperately to find a cure and that is the story of the <UNK> the <UNK> is an extremely boring film because nothing happens it is filled with boring dialogue and illogical gaps between events and stupid actors steven seagal has totally up in this movie and i would not recommend this <UNK> to my worst enemy 3 10
<START> guilt and redemption are two of the <UNK> emotions and plot elements of the heavy powerful dramas that the oscars love so much which is kind of funny since the <UNK> runner was only nominated for best original score the lack of nominations was perhaps <UNK> while most film adaptations of books or any other means are usually inferior to their literary counterparts and the <UNK> runner is not an exception marc <UNK> film adaptation is a good one br br most people are familiar with the story the book having been read by millions so i won't go into the plot except to say that the book stays pretty faithful to its source that being said if you don't know the plot see the movie or better yet read the book br br the best thing the <UNK> runner has going for it other than its story is director marc <UNK> <UNK> is a director with epic scope and unique vision that is perfectly <UNK> in bringing book to the screen a small part of me worried that he would use the same dreamy images that were included in one of <UNK> earlier features finding <UNK> don't get me wrong finding <UNK> is a wonderful film one of my favorites actually but the visual <UNK> he used in there doesn't have a place here fortunately <UNK> understands that and the brilliance of his direction shows his <UNK> though the lack of a best director nomination for his work here is not exactly a travesty i see a number of <UNK> in store for him down the road br br also of note is the screenplay adaptation it remains faithful to the source but it leaves room for <UNK> vision to interpret the material the dialogue is not <UNK> down and it along with <UNK> direction moves at a solid pace like <UNK> the lack of recognition at awards time for the screenplay was not an outrage but i wouldn't have complained if it was at least nominated br br the <UNK> line here between this film being great and outstanding lies with the acting most of the performances are solid but there are some that don't quite make the cut and it hurts the film the most notable weak performance comes from who plays the young <UNK> it's not that it's bad it's just that it's not as effective as it could be he just can't translate the guilt that <UNK> <UNK> to the audience in fact i think i might have been a little lost at this point in the movie at this point had i not read the book because of this he looks somber and at times <UNK> but we can't feel his emotions this is a difficult part to portray and for the most part young holds his own which is especially surprising since this is his first film role br br the best performances come from who plays the adult <UNK> and shaun who plays the wise <UNK> may not be a known name though he was in paul <UNK> united <UNK> but his work here is amazing he's a quiet modest man and he <UNK> perfectly when needed to a lesser capable actor could have made the character of khan into a cliché but shaun uses enough subtlety and care in his performance that he creates what the clichés are trying to portray br br forgive me if i go on a rant here but this is something that i must address and that is the film's pg 13 rating the fact that this film received such a low rating is outrageous there is no justification for it some could argue that the rating was bent because of the need for everyone to see it like the gore in saving private ryan which some say should have earned the film an <UNK> 17 rating but that exception cannot be applied here the only purpose the scene serves is to tell the story <UNK> probably at the <UNK> of the producers tried as hard as he could to tame the film's most painful and disturbing scene to allow the film to sneak by with a pg 13 rating but the subject material is too disturbing to be depicted in any way and get less than an r rating regardless of if how <UNK> is may be portrayed worse this editing <UNK> the scene of much of its power and by trying it make it less disturbing to get the lower rating is insulting furthermore some scenes of violence are incredibly disturbing as well in terms of how much time these scenes take of the movie it doesn't add to much but what is there is well deserving of an r rating at the very least the mpaa whose system of rating movies has always been corrupt has sunk to a new low by giving this film such a low rating br br but one shouldn't fault the film for this the film is a solid film that is well worth seeing especially if they are fans of the book
<START> as a person god how i hate that phrase i just happened to catch this on cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch overall it was a fantastic movie yes i was a little disappointed upon finding out that neither actor is disabled and yes i was a little disappointed that more of the movie wasn't filmed from the <UNK> point of view of the disabled can you imagine what it's like always being the <UNK> person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life with a view of nothing but other people's <UNK> and <UNK> having to always wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only handicapped <UNK> enduring everyone else's rude <UNK> while you wait and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me been there done that literally but the movie was true enough to matter while i've never lived in a home or <UNK> <UNK> there were plenty of times throughout the movie where i found myself <UNK> and saying to myself yeah that's true that's happened to me what impressed me is that some of the <UNK> on this board expressed the fact that the movie made them view life a little differently and with a little more insight as the lives of a silent can't ask more than that out of a movie that it makes you think and view life differently so by virtue of that alone the movies was tremendously successful should be required viewing of every kid in junior high school br br pretty much for every person that's severely physically disabled independence is one of if not the most important focus of our daily lives from working to <UNK> to <UNK> for those of you who felt the movie was ' try living our life for a single day you'll see that the movie was because it's true the challenges the actors faced only <UNK> the surface of what happens to us every day if we're lucky we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters including the girl did every day presents obstacles for us to overcome it's just that there's no <UNK> dramatic music to <UNK> our lives unless it's in our lol
<START> armed and dangerous is not one of the <UNK> of john candy this film about a fired cop who ends up working for a small security system run by the mob is very weak and not very much a comedy there are some moments that i did enjoy like looking at candy in a pilot suit but it doesn't seem to matter much armed and dangerous is still a dangerously disappointing dud brought to us by the director of the equally dumb <UNK> <UNK> what a sad excuse for a comedy br br 1 out of 5
<START> during a lifetime of seeing and enjoying thousands of films feeling <UNK> is absolutely the worst major film with a list stars that i have ever seen bar none this movie totally fails on every level it's poorly photographed and edited there's uninspired acting the kind where the actors appear bored out of their minds just collecting <UNK> perhaps and worst of all the script appears to have been written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in <UNK> i can't even begin to comprehend how the writer director could ever have found anyone to <UNK> this project let alone attract any of the stars that it did i truly wish i could get back the time that i wasted watching this piece of garbage if possible i would have given this film a grade of zero better yet a negative number
<START> shadows and fog is surely one of woody allen's weakest films right up there with september and hollywood ending though nothing allen has done equals the awfulness of anything else br br shadows and fog is allen's homage to the german <UNK> style of film making all stark and stylized light and shadow and you guessed it lots of fog but you can tell allen got caught up in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care about br br luckily he made husbands and wives the same year so things weren't a total wash for him br br grade d
<START> it's a shame house calls isn't better known is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle aged <UNK> and gun shy rather than <UNK> teen stars could be if you're over 35 you'll probably get this comedy if you're over 45 you're really going to get this comedy if you're 25 wait until you're older to see it br br the unlikely pairing of matthau and jackson works precisely because it is so unlikely there's a wonderful line of <UNK> that sums up what is happening between the two of them i like old <UNK> because you don't have to explain who ronald coleman is if that's not the exact line it's close br br the premise of a sub par hospital run by <UNK> rings true art portrayal of a <UNK> head surgeon is absolutely brilliant it is impossible not to laugh out loud at his delivery subplots if you can call them that are fun too like between matthau and jackson's teenage son everything hits just exactly the right tone br br okay there's the bit where matthau has to wear women's clothing that's a bit over the top and an easy mark but still it's walter matthau in drag it's funny
<START> this film is brilliant without a doubt watched it a while ago after constant from family members who are right into their sci fi films which i am not and thought it was quite good but after recently watching a few documentaries on outer space etc we watched it again and it is good br br kevin spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and i really like jeff bridges big blown away <UNK> road the film revolves around a patient in a <UNK> home who claims he is from another planet yeah right you think but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth br br that is how the story <UNK> with bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with as he is known his own psychiatric colleagues his wife and family his brother in law and his <UNK> work colleagues who after getting some data from pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth a great film that <UNK> you wondering br br 8 10 dave
<START> if you don't like mel brooks you won't like this film that's a given why anyone wouldn't like his films is unknown to me but for those who can't see the light just avoid it br br everyone else this is a classic the entire cast is perfect carey <UNK> is a dashing clever british robin hood amy <UNK> overacts appropriately as marion richard lewis is his usual distracted annoyed self roger <UNK> is a brilliant combination of and violence as <UNK> the sheriff of and dave <UNK> eric allan kramer mark <UNK> and the sadly underused matthew are the perfect merry men br br there are similarities to <UNK> blazing <UNK> and every other mel brooks movie but why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well the pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again from the view of a 16 year old at least it's complete and utter parody every second a play for a laugh some of them don't work but most do and well i discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time i watched the film br br of course if being <UNK> by constant visual and verbal gags isn't your style you wouldn't like this this isn't an academy award winner it's mel brooks you know what it is when you're getting into it if you want <UNK> laughter surprisingly well developed characters and <UNK> to last a lifetime watch this
<START> what this film has is its realism you really do get the feeling screenwriter james slater has been doing his <UNK> on the subject of downhill <UNK> while director michael ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style however the problem is unless you re a big fan of the sport there s not a lot in downhill <UNK> to grab your attention br br before anyone asks why i watched it i did so because it featured the great gene hackman in an early role but that s not really a good enough reason for watching
<START> i switched this on from cable on a <UNK> and was treated to quite a surprise although very predictable this film turned out to be quite enjoyable no big stars but well directed and just plain fun with all the over hyped crap that is out there it is very nice to get an unexpected surprise now and then and this little film fits the bill nicely 9 10
<START> the world is going to miss john <UNK> this was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second but don't let that <UNK> you from seeking it out <UNK> direction is assured and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast br br someone else has already pointed them out but i also want to talk up james gregory and <UNK> <UNK> in two key supporting roles both would work for <UNK> again gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in the <UNK> candidate and they do good work for him here br br if the whole thing seems too simple in the end that's merely because <UNK> and writer robert chose to tell a simple story and they do it well keep a <UNK> for it turner classic movies just might show it again
<START> chris penn is hilarious as the all time <UNK> brother of jeff this movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at <UNK> high casting was perfect and one of my favorite <UNK> of almost all eddie van <UNK> which went on to become songs on and <UNK> <UNK> knowledge this movie is one of the great <UNK> film heroes with cheech and chong fast times was more depressing than funny <UNK> friends cheating on friends <UNK> off in <UNK> bad jobs and failing school someone must hate the eighties to like <UNK> more than the wild life the film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits michelle in the <UNK> store or ben <UNK> in his first role in the <UNK> <UNK> store
<START> this movie is crappy beyond any limits it's incredible a very bad ripoff from jaws and other better shark movies a really bad one everything is really pathetic the story is <UNK> crap actors are bad effects very cheap no creativity whatsoever it looks like some really children took jaws script and arranged it randomly then its parents took their 8 <UNK> camera and shot the movie with their neighbors the music is really inappropriate just some elevator music bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed again <UNK> to very loud elevator music <UNK> maria the author should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be <UNK> from the titles the movie acts as perfect <UNK> how crappy music will destroy any scene which is supposed to be thrilling there is one major difference to jaws though in the beginning of jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite well there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite when this does not work guys take an big load of dynamite and spent like 1 4 of movie by placing <UNK> in some <UNK> ship this is really original way to catch the fish i have to admit they use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a <UNK> i would guess <UNK> class of <UNK> or to dig another <UNK> channel this is just incredible i'm glad they did not try to use <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> nuclear strike to eliminate this bad bad approximately 2 m shark well there is <UNK> disappearing native indian who looks like german <UNK> too in this mess this is not a movie this is a warning example how bad the movies may be as a warning it is useful but the public should be <UNK> from this crap most of italian movies is bad but this this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word
<START> i was forced to read this sappy love story between a german 24 year old <UNK> and a 12 year old jew that has political correctness written all over it its kind of like the movie spirit in which a horse wants to be free but those evil americans wont let it because they need it well i have good news the americans are evil in the german soldier and his summer book why horses where given to us by god and if the americans needed a horse the can darn well use it in the same sense the german had been trying to kill americans but this book movie makes it seem ok the casting is absolutely awful the girl is hispanic the mother is white the dad it from mostly white descent and the little sister is shirley the acting is pretty bad too the serious parts become comedy bad movie bad book but both have different endings don't read or see either one
<START> ok the box look interesting the opening have great music and its kinda original to that its all ok but when the movie start well its not my first movie i watched ghost lake and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here the story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student with <UNK> effect that me laugh the blood look like a mix of red and white paint the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop all the movie is shot in day very great for a movie supposed to be horror and there like no gore 1 scene only and it look so home made and not credible and near no blood it can be considered a great thing considering the look of the blood show and 1 demon for the whole movie the story is going nowhere it give you the impression that it never start there so much useless scene done only to give the movie the average duration time when the demon search the guy in the dogs thing for about 4 minutes way too much slow mo things well lets just say this movie is a z series one and a very poor one all cool idea lost themselves and you get a cheesy movie it bored my all long and i'm not the guy who get bored very easily with horror movie man i even like house of the dead and alone in the dark from uwe boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst director but here it look too much like some guys wanting to make a movie for fun plus for us french <UNK> tough i understand english i prefer to watch movie in my native language there the usual bad translation in normal movie you can barely see its not the actor speaking you have to check on lips etc here you just have to listen to it and you know it very cheesy
<START> in out is a comedy with a simple premise it admirably succeeds in the mission of being funny and entertaining br br the comedy in this film <UNK> from the ridiculous to the sublime physical comedy exists alongside dry humor with a nice veteran turn by bob <UNK> kevin kline is predictably in excellent form in this film alongside tom <UNK> not playing to his expected square <UNK> leading man type mr <UNK> plays his humor well and displays a nice sense of comedic timing the cast makes this film successful br br not all films with homosexual themes are made to advance some sort of sinister hidden hollywood liberal agenda in point of fact this film was simply made to entertain and if any part of this films makes the viewer think then it was a <UNK> of the well acted work by a terrific cast of professionals frequently tongue in cheek i found myself laughing at the right moments a solid b
<START> <UNK> established himself by now as a talented and impressive image maker the <UNK> posters for mister lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions though there's one in particular i've yet to see in <UNK> material that of a blue clad nun <UNK> a dog with a stick surrounded by green forest with <UNK> rain <UNK> down the opening images of this film of michael jackson <UNK> diego <UNK> riding a small <UNK> round a track is strangely compelling and beautiful roy mister lonely plays on the soundtrack and the images unfold in slow motion there's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character <UNK> a dance without music though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him in the middle of a paris street <UNK> in sound effects and jump cuts that evoke both a feeling of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the character's dance routine br br the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant father <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> priest about to fly with some nuns over and drop food into <UNK> areas nearby in a scene that is both light hearted and affecting <UNK> must deal with a <UNK> enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco as the exchange develops <UNK> draws out of the man a confession he has <UNK> and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place this scene short and sweet <UNK> particular weight after one learns its improvised origins the <UNK> is played by a non actor who was on set when and co were filming and his <UNK> ways had given him in real life a lasting overwhelming guilt br br <UNK> the film is hit and miss a succession of <UNK> interesting moments that add to a <UNK> muddled narrative whereas <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent <UNK> <UNK> mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room <UNK> a few scenes were cut from the film which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters due to continuity errors in costume a result no doubt due to the absence of a shooting script and <UNK> tendency for <UNK> one deleted scene in particular in which denis <UNK> and <UNK> morgan have sex would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film i won't spoil it but it's there to <UNK> any feeling of warmth or celebration and as it is only half succeeds br br the two <UNK> of the narrative <UNK> literally are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same <UNK> meaning one <UNK> the other and vice versa it's something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation but there's not enough of the <UNK> scenes to merit their place in the film and so any connection between these two <UNK> connected threads is inevitably strained and the inclusion is in retrospect tedious br br this is an ambitious step forward from <UNK> <UNK> boy that suffers mostly at least in the <UNK> segments from having far too many characters for the film's running length a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone as was originally planned br br with many of the <UNK> self contained beauty and moments of real genuine connection with the soundtrack this feels like it'd be much more suited to an art <UNK> or photo <UNK> as an exploration of and the nature of <UNK> it'd lose none of its power indeed for me it would perhaps be more impressive the loneliness attached to iconic such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who <UNK> to be like them is well captured in images such as that <UNK> a gorgeous samantha <UNK> <UNK> the camera with a seven year <UNK> pose in the middle of a forest or when davis jr ' jason <UNK> post dance rehearsal with his back to the camera <UNK> an incredible <UNK> lake br br as it is moments like these and all those where the titles of randomly chosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be br br for those who see it i lost all faith during the egg singing scene late on you'll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb as some sort of <UNK> attempt at the new cinematic language for which has previously been <UNK>
<START> apparently the film has a harsh anti bush message if it does i didn't get it that's all it is it's boring and useless period br br it's too serious at times to be a comedy too slow to be a thriller not funny not gripping not exciting not film it's too everything to be the opposite and <UNK> versa i was amazed at how bad a film could suck don't even think of watching it br br i have watched literally hundreds of films and never have i been so <UNK> to write a warning on imdb avoid at all costs you have been warned br br even the making of is painfully boring it's just people talking <UNK> with loads of inside jokes <UNK> of a camera sort of like a home movie there even is a part where a guy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on the set by the film crew still beats the movie i guess
<START> first this movie was made in 1978 so that tells you that the movie is going to be bad anyway but i am not saying that all old movies are bad second the special effects we're terrible for even that time finally the acting was so bad <UNK> the clown could have done it better it makes you wonder how people get the money to make movies this pathetic this movie sucks
<START> this movie has more goofs than any other movie i have seen in my life the special effects are damned terrible for instance near the end when the <UNK> is falling after the <UNK> door tears off the thing <UNK> like a toy the special effects of airport 1970 are way better than this crap also the force of a <UNK> opening up at <UNK> and speed would essentially turn the thing inside out that is if it would even open at all but the movie has its good points mostly when it ends that's also cheesy e g the thing lands on a bank of loosely packed snow if it did that it would <UNK> into a million pieces overall 2 out of 10 instant flop great laugh flick
<START> the acting was very sub par you had <UNK> acting like triple <UNK> dumber forest ranger brother a scott <UNK> look alike as his who i guess your supposed to care about but there is no emotional involvement anywhere you have the stupid lesbian not that i have any thing against lesbians i don't just stupid ones who keep running around in a <UNK> like shirt and a <UNK> like hat who keeps asking if anyone saw her dead lover br br the villain could be scary and there is a morality tale somewhere about trying to fight age and death but it is lost in this movie <UNK> <UNK> points out to the soon to be victims the way back into town while obviously there are city lights behind him br br also a <UNK> of ed <UNK> but <UNK> it as a citizen of <UNK> we have had our share of monsters <UNK> dahmer and mccarthy but if your going to use it <UNK> it right br br god why do i watch all these terrible films oh yes i am a <UNK> for punishment and i watch these so you don't have to
<START> frank clint eastwood is being <UNK> by mitch <UNK> john <UNK> a <UNK> terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught in the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer john kramer <UNK> bell from the saw series through clever planning and influence frank is able to make the arrest of <UNK> bell br br from thereafter its a series of cat and mouse chase <UNK> is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile once again showing a different role in this film he <UNK> me with his ability to his characters with the next film br br i've watch <UNK> play in con air as a menacing insanely smart <UNK> in of mice and men as the <UNK> challenged bunny lover <UNK> to name a few he plays a very smart <UNK> terrorist who is very sane but is <UNK> into thinking he can <UNK> his captures br br clint eastwood is no one special me he's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing he can really <UNK> you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes the characters he plays are simplistic and one dimensional br br <UNK> russo plays eastwood's love interest in the film and <UNK> me with her supporting actually being a bigger role to me than eastwood's br br while this might seem like an action blockbuster it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation you have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end along the way you'll be <UNK> by <UNK> and eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse
<START> the reason why this movie sucks have these people even read a bible everything in the movie was about <UNK> god was staying out of it that didn't happen god directed everything he told them where to go and what to do also the people <UNK> for 40 years after they arrived at and betrayed god again they didn't wander for 40 years then suddenly find it it was a punishment for their doubts maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again everything in this movie was about <UNK> they made god look like a jerk who was messing with <UNK> the whole time no no no no no god was their the whole time and he wanted the people to see he was taking care of them how dare they say otherwise not even close to the passage and <UNK> was kept out because he was angry at the people and blatantly <UNK> god he <UNK> badly and was told he would not be allowed to enter for it when did <UNK> run off and yell at god for everything in the bible never actually read your story before you make up whatever you think is a good idea also this whole god stayed out of it for the most part and made them do it themselves is not true god did everything for the people he provided for them in every way and god told them where to go he was there the whole time the whole we have to do it ourselves is true in some ways but back then thats not how it worked yes today he doesn't work directly for everyone to see but back then he actually killed people after the golden <UNK> thing god worked directly with the people read the bible next time echo bridge or don't make another bible movie
<START> why wasn't this voted for best picture of 1998 this has to be the best movie ever it makes something like kane look like utter crap come on kane wasn't even in color i love this movie it has to be the best movie i've ever put money down on i am still shocked that it wasn't nominated for anything br br if 10 is the highest you can give it i give it 20
<START> one of <UNK> longest films up to that point <UNK> on carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then <UNK> well known story about carmen i was a little confused about the difference between the <UNK> listing of the <UNK> <UNK> on carmen and the <UNK> version based on the running time i assume that it was the <UNK> version that i saw since the <UNK> one is a good 20 minutes longer and from what i've read those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes br br from the very beginning it's clear that <UNK> on carmen is one of <UNK> most complex and ambitious efforts to date starting off with a long back story told through inter titles about the tragic love story of carmen br br carmen is sent by a band of <UNK> a band who put the <UNK> in gypsy to seduce a spanish officer so they can pull off their <UNK> operation it's a clever <UNK> band of criminals the leader of whom has spent 50 years learning to steal thinking he might be offered a job in politics br br on a side note i've seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of <UNK> earlier work but probably none quite as overt as in this one near the beginning of the movie as the band of <UNK> are traveling there is a scene where the <UNK> and women are <UNK> and an inter title explains that the <UNK> are the ones with long ears in case you couldn't tell i guess br br chaplin plays the part of don jose the hapless officer who is to be <UNK> by carmen he is described as a brave soldier and lover of women not exactly a stretch for chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant shoulder arms and of course he didn't have to act about being a lover of women br br what is different here of course is his polished military uniform and straight backed manner interspersed of course with some of his traditional slap stick moves he strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority struggling to maintain the respect of his <UNK> by <UNK> a gruff <UNK> exterior br br soon carmen enters loved by all men under the age of and she immediately begins <UNK> with charlie i should mention that for a good majority of the movie it is surprisingly faithful to the original story which was full of jealousy and tragedy chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover able to evoke a jealous passion that i've never seen from him there's at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary br br chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end and his <UNK> charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasn't very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on probably about five times longer than it was worth although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop i always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets br br the end of the film is it's strongest part it bears striking resemblance to romeo and juliet but just when you think that chaplin is going to conduct a major <UNK> experiment by from his traditional style there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage chaplin as anything i've ever seen nice work
<START> all that talent but when ya have poor direction and a weak screenplay it <UNK> matter who is in a movie very tired attempt at telling a tale which was actually interesting in the beginning but then quickly fell apart toward the end to bad

<START> i own this movie on dvd and i have watched it about 10 times and it's still funny the jokes will never get boring and i often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them the premise is that richard and eddie of bottom fame own the <UNK> hotel in britain next to a nuclear power plant they are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in br br to watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it but overall it's a great movie
