<START> i understand wanting to make a movie that is edgy and different i understand the previous reviewer comments that this is a miss understood movie my point is as soon as this movie ended my first comment was this is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent she uses <UNK> money to make a movie she wrote directs and pays for obviously to close to the movie to realize there was no character development and no directions such as a beginning middle and ending the <UNK> part was good and edgy but what was the point i saw a women go to a house find some pictures screw the caretaker come out side on a very cold night not believable to check on noise and runs over her caretaker lover movie ends some one <UNK> my ignorant <UNK> i really want to know what the point is what was the <UNK> vision why no development of the dead lover why no background on the caretaker what is the point of the night vision what is the point of the <UNK> on the car why a dead caretaker why tell us about an escaped mental patient <UNK> tom what's with the <UNK> oh and the <UNK> is that suppose to <UNK> <UNK> house this is <UNK> why why would the caretaker feel like it's his house that aspect was never pursued as for william <UNK> i rented this movie because he was in it and known for edgy characters write back and do tell me what i need to learn i am just a mom in middle america who loves movies chris
<START> murders are occurring in a texas desert town who is responsible slight <UNK> of mystery and racial tensions the latter really doesn't fit but otherwise strictly for slasher fans who will appreciate the gore and nudity which are two conventional elements for these films br br dana <UNK> of friday the 13th part 3 <UNK> stars as the <UNK> quasi detective teen br br 1 2 out of br br mpaa rated r for violence and gore nudity and some language
<START> while most of the movie is very amateurish the <UNK> slaughter scene is played up but not untrue <UNK> law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it's skin the <UNK> slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one or has seen the <UNK> film showing a <UNK> slaughter in which the animals throat is cut and the <UNK> cut out while it is still alive conscious and obviously suffering we must remember that history is written by the <UNK> is one even allowed to even think that maybe the nazis were right br br doesn't it say anything that the nazis had <UNK> this vicious religious slaughter and the jews are still practicing it even today
<START> if bob <UNK> was to see this mini series he would have cried this was complete waste of time and money i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was <UNK> work br br may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series was br br poor mira blair <UNK> and <UNK> why did they sign to <UNK> this low br br horrible
<START> seriously i just wrapped up my first viewing of <UNK> and words have failed me br br i remember a time when i would see charles <UNK> name on a film and my heart would race he was never a wes craven or a john carpenter he was a <UNK> of hope for the little man the guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the <UNK> but they still <UNK> harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure br br and now this br br a painfully obvious <UNK> walking trail <UNK> for the <UNK> and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be an ancient cave i mean they didn't even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel ugh instead of a creepy demon gladiator as the cover implies we're treated to a dude wearing the latest in wal mart halloween <UNK> there's a pretty cool looking corpse who occasionally comes to life to <UNK> and <UNK> his fingers but he doesn't even learn to stand until the final five minutes why couldn't he be the villain instead we've got frat boy joe with a plastic sword <UNK> br br charles band you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe i love movies that are so bad they're good hell i occasionally enjoy a flick thats so bad its just bad this one however is just unwatchable a perfect example of making a buck rather than making a quality film
<START> nothing new in this hackneyed romance with characters put into unbelievable situations speaking dialogue that borders on the ridiculous this is an example of another movie put into production before serious script problems were solved don't waste your time
<START> i feel <UNK> <UNK> was one of the best written and acted out drama series to come on any network in a long time this show had great potential and i couldn't wait to view it each week this could be developed into a great <UNK> soap people look forward to this type of acting as we are being reality tv <UNK> i long for the type of writing and acting that shows like dallas <UNK> landing <UNK> <UNK> place etc provided <UNK> <UNK> updated this concept quite well and i anticipated it only getting better there's so much to expand on with these characters and they were all very interesting and captivating in their own right it would be a loss to not explore this and develop these characters after having drawn and hooked us into their world i absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious interesting and <UNK> without going overboard or <UNK> loved it
<START> forget plan 9 this is the ultimate fiasco a costume drama <UNK> directed scripted acted etc this film is based on <UNK> <UNK> not so much better novel i hate meryl streep and antonio <UNK> in non spanish films and the other actors including <UNK> my favourite actress and jeremy <UNK> try hard to get over such a terrible script plenty of mistakes like for example since when does it snow in <UNK> in <UNK> and very cruel with tons of that evil named magic realism this stands out as the worst movie of all time it totally sucks
<START> castle of blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in italy in the 60s the film has all of the right elements old dark house atmosphere a decent story and barbara steele steele makes most any film worth seeing br br the story concerns a haunted castle people have visited but none have returned our hero makes a <UNK> that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his <UNK> but the night he visits is a special night it's the night each year when the dead return to <UNK> their deaths br br the only flaw i see in the movie is the running time it almost feels padded there is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest but once he does find something the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable br br castle of blood is a definite must for steele fans and fans of italian gothic horror in general
<START> is there a book titled how to make a movie with every <UNK> vs <UNK> cliché imaginable if not ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes the set up the characters the various sub plots the death scenes and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases much better it's amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie br br and can someone please tell me what in god's name myrna loy is doing in this monkey turd of a movie a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies
<START> ms patty <UNK> story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles i saw myself acting out just like her i was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children br br i saw the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and i have loved this movie so much anyone who has <UNK> with manic depression could get so much from this movie never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for that is not the issue here the issue is how ms duke had an illness and fought to survive it and <UNK> ms duke has much to be proud of in her <UNK> with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope br br unless a person has <UNK> with this illness personally they don't know the hell they have to live with the movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts it was so real so so real it was like watching myself up there on screen br br i wish i could thank ms patty duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness <UNK>
<START> this is a review of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> story ' theatrical release chicago <UNK> film festival 2007 one of the <UNK> uninspired and most tedious <UNK> documentaries i have seen if the film i saw in a movie theater was originally released on tv i would <UNK> with its producers and <UNK> to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a <UNK> worthy documentary feature even as a made for tv documentary the sentimental piano <UNK> accompanying <UNK> sitting in front of flower <UNK> in hotel rooms and the pompous pseudo literary narration <UNK> more true of a <UNK> bed <UNK> the only redeeming aspects of this the <UNK> story of freddy <UNK> or <UNK> was it the <UNK> story of princess diana are the original concert video and tv footage <UNK> freddy <UNK> and queen <UNK> interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights such as he was a free spirit really i thought freddy <UNK> was a company man <UNK> those freddy <UNK> by brian may or <UNK> <UNK> that shed new and <UNK> light into <UNK> complex life and character and what up with the harry potter like <UNK> school segments how did the interview with the first girl crush who now works in a travel agency and members of freddy's first school band contribute to what i really want to know about <UNK> vital <UNK> of his personal life his sexuality his artistic style and growth queen the band remain <UNK> these filmmakers don't ask a single provocative question nor do they engage in independent or <UNK> research of their subject instead delivering a tedious montage of <UNK> clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend who doesn't deserve to be remembered by this history channel biography your grandparents can <UNK> off to on a sunday night
<START> well i guess it supposedly not a classic because there are only a few easily recognizable faces but i personally think it is it's a very beautiful sweet movie henry <UNK> did a great job with his character and it really impressed me
<START> <UNK> is the best thing to come out of <UNK> including wayne knight this show doesn't just appeal to <UNK> and <UNK> some people love it and they're all <UNK> at first glimpse i admit it seems a little crude but it grows enormously on you also to correct something that one of the other critics has said in correct tv com doesn't say does that mean you're <UNK> now he says does that mean you're <UNK> <UNK> this is his phrase in the show mr <UNK> is i think the funniest of all like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br firstly i'll admit that the early episode were a bit good but after a while the episodes became great and just when the series had found it's surreal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it br br i know nick is meant for kids but every once in a while a brilliant show appears that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults these shows include mr bean the animated series charlie brown <UNK> <UNK> modern life at times and <UNK> <UNK> all of these must have been considered too good with the exception of <UNK> 'cause nick felt the need to <UNK> them br br what i like the famous final episode where gordon fight a duck br br i'd also like to see a dvd with plenty of audio <UNK> and behind the scenes <UNK> and including the final episode br br but of course what i'd definitely like to see is the show come back on the air wake up nick br br i wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the gag closing credits that would be great
<START> how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this it's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent even the well known <UNK> john is acting very poor especially in the double murder scene how amateurish the screen plan is very very extended perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie be careful not to fall asleep while watching the set is obviously very often a blue screen f g the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor probably reason different languages of actors but other international productions do handle this much more professional advice do not watch it's a <UNK> waste of time
<START> as always controversial movies like this have mixed reviews you either love it or you hate it and not everyone will like this movie this shows the perspective of the killers which is something i personally feel is something important to consider you may hate them you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective br br the movie is shot entirely using a hand held camera something that i think works quite well as it makes it more realistic it is told completely from the killers point of view from their missions to family <UNK> all leading up the big day zero day in which they are planning on a massacre at their school zero day does not offer answers but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing they are shown to be surprisingly normal typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives and if we didn't know what they were planning we wouldn't expect a thing they make it clear throughout the whole movie that no one else knows about their plan br br the acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete <UNK> we can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future despite how this is a <UNK> movie one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to <UNK> <UNK> and andre are <UNK> similar to eric harris and dylan <UNK> not so much in looks but in manner as someone who has <UNK> <UNK> very <UNK> i could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it br br the actual massacre is shown through <UNK> cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things i have ever seen i was completely in shock after seeing it and its a feeling that stays around for a while it is very realistic and well done and it is very difficult to watch br br all in all zero day is an excellent movie and i think everyone should at least check it out in the past we have always simply <UNK> killers <UNK> and assumed that either they were <UNK> <UNK> for disaster or had media influence but as zero day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that and we can never truly understand why <UNK> such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers
<START> this was a truly insipid film the performances are third rate and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died my reason for renting this was simple find a movie with <UNK> i needed a visual aid for my presentation so i figured why not use a clip boy was i wrong after searching my local video store i came upon this where it was <UNK> titled <UNK> i thought what the hey and decided to give it a try well i was very unhappy with my results there was maybe one scene i could use and meanwhile i was practically falling asleep because of the sheer <UNK> of the flick so i took this back and picked up ed wood there's a movie i can use as an example then again anything would be <UNK> compared to the drivel that is <UNK>
<START> this is a truly awful film what they have done is taken a tv show which was never aimed at young children given it the george lucas treatment i e ruined it by <UNK> it to appeal to the younger audience br br ok so the thunderbirds tv show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows in fact it was pretty formulaic but it was always enjoyable to watch especially when the models got blown up and the voice cast wasn't too bad br br this suffers from bad casting bad acting with the notable exceptions of sophia <UNK> as lady penelope ron cook as parker who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played after this travesty i wouldn't let <UNK> direct traffic br br the whole point of thunderbirds was that it was about the whole tracy family how they worked as a team <UNK> disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters br br avoid this rubbish like the plague br br i only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported
<START> the ogre doesn't seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988 and i guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in order to help it sell better well the film is directed by <UNK> <UNK> the man behind the first two demons films and <UNK> and demons are somewhat alike in that they're both <UNK> anyway but other than that this film has no connections to the other two films it is however rather good italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films and while it's not completely obvious it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from <UNK> the plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in italy she is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an ogre living in her basement it's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there's a murderous ogre living in the basement br br the film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for italian tv so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant but for what it is this is certainly a very decent horror film <UNK> <UNK> may not have as keen an eye as his father mario did but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really <UNK> the film well the central setting a large castle makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and <UNK> makes the best of it even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times such as the <UNK> style pool scene the plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange particularly between the husband and wife there's not a great deal of bloodshed but <UNK> does get to do a little bit with the special effects the ogre itself looks really silly and it's a good job that we don't get to see it very often we do <UNK> down to a fitting if highly predictable ending and overall i have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended
<START> going <UNK> is actually one of the funniest candy films i have ever seen period sure it's kinda low budget but it's a non stop comedic tour de force there are tons of memorable quotes for instance when his soon to be father in law asks him how much he earns candy says oh i pull down anywhere between thirty and eleven thousand dollars a year sir oh course it is <UNK> delivery that sells it just classic stuff eugene levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker a clip of his horrible low budget movie kung fu u will have you rolling br br so if you are a candy fan and want to <UNK> a forgotten gem i can't recommend this movie enough
<START> my favorite jackie chan movie will always be drunken master 1978 followed by this film from 1985 police story in it chan plays a hong kong super cop who <UNK> a notorious crime lord and his gang and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend <UNK> lin so that she can turn <UNK> evidence as the story goes on the gangster sends his <UNK> to <UNK> lin but chan takes matters into his own <UNK> and feet while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay like drunken master police story has many of the signature stunts and over the top martial arts action choreography that chan has become famous for <UNK> in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall in his role as director chan <UNK> in excellence giving a charismatic and funny performance that <UNK> the action while light on the overall slapstick humor of drunken master at heart police story is just that a police story a gritty cop thriller that would be <UNK> copied over the years to come br br 10 10
<START> have not seen this 1958 film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed kim novak playing the role as <UNK> <UNK> who is an actual witch and has an aunt named <UNK> <UNK> who is also a witch and gillian also has a brother <UNK> named nick played by jack lemmon when gillian sets her eyes on <UNK> henderson james stewart who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with gillian the story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love <UNK> or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between <UNK> and gillian so nick and aunt <UNK> decided they have to do something about this situation great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958
<START> hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internet based star trek fan series while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship <UNK> or new <UNK> hidden frontier concentrates largely on story and in that regard it does very well indeed br br hidden frontier has no physical sets instead actors are filmed against a <UNK> and the backgrounds inserted <UNK> one of hidden <UNK> greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced one of the ways in which this is achieved is by <UNK> the virtual sets at the time of filming instead of in post production while this does save a great deal of time it's also worth noting that the quality of the <UNK> footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post production though it still serves its purpose br br while it may not be everyone's cup of tea hidden frontier is well worth a shot though you might be best to start off watching the third season since this is where the producers really start to hit their <UNK>
<START> i had a personal interest in this movie when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> union at the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft <UNK> i was told to bring a <UNK> the next morning with enough clothes etc for one or two weeks when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp <UNK> or camp <UNK> once we were <UNK> in we went north a few miles into camp <UNK> the big marine base there on the beach we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base it took us about a week or ten days to complete the <UNK> which included a water tank gun <UNK> sand <UNK> <UNK> and living quarters all this was at very high pay sometimes <UNK> <UNK> which was triple our regular <UNK> <UNK> our food was also first rate prime <UNK> at lunch etc which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home br br once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out which was about eight or ten months later then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my <UNK> finally came on screen then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to <UNK> a bit disappointing but still fun br br in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since i learned later that this movie was <UNK> by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis which maybe accounts for our <UNK> pay and lifestyle down there bob <UNK>
<START> cat soup has two hello kitty type <UNK> <UNK> on a bizarre trip through the <UNK> where anything can happen and does this mind <UNK> asian short uses no dialog <UNK> word <UNK> instead there is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself and make sure no one under 10 is in the room <UNK> and <UNK> and cruelty and <UNK> and sudden death and <UNK> disregard for others are common themes honest perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the <UNK> swim through and in and also ride but like practically everything else in this film that silly <UNK> <UNK> soon comes to a horrible end
<START> a movie about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who has a <UNK> husband who she loves but she loves sex too in the course of the movie she gets multiple men in bed including her husband and brother also there's a tame lesbian sequence br br this film put russ meyer on the map and was i believe the first <UNK> acclaimed x rated film ever it was a big hit when it came out unfortunately it doesn't date well br br it is well directed and <UNK> <UNK> is just great whatever happened to her and it was very colorful but by today's standards it's extremely tame i'm surprised it has an <UNK> 17 rating now there's no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity at all also it's sadly pretty dull and the addition of politics at the end was confusing and pretty silly it is worth catching though to see what was considered very shocking in 1968 <UNK> i saw the cut version which has an r rating but i've heard only a few seconds here and there are missing br br <UNK> next film beyond the valley of the dolls is much better and dates very well catch that instead
<START> i'm not sure if it is available worldwide but if anyone who's deciding what is supposed to be put on <UNK> and distributed in video <UNK> is reading this please please buy it if i wasn't clear get the movie into <UNK> br br can't be explained must see
<START> the world is facing <UNK> destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the sun to <UNK> catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart yes it's <UNK> crisis aka crisis <UNK> which burned up a huge <UNK> of change that's never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a happy meal for each of the cast in japan before going straight to video remember them in a re edited version credited to one alan <UNK> the plot <UNK> pretty much the same as sunshine suicide mission to the sun <UNK> on board logic cast <UNK> except that this time they're not trying to <UNK> the sun but to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> before it can reach earth with a talking bomb voiced by paul williams who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more <UNK> given that the cast also includes jack palance at his most <UNK> <UNK> charlton heston at his most rigid top liner tim <UNK> at his most anonymous the original hills have <UNK> unforgettable michael <UNK> you may not remember the name but you do remember that face and peter boyle as the <UNK> out to <UNK> the mission because er if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down you'd expect if not a laugh a minute at least a laugh every reel no joy this is the worst kind of bad movie a boring one the fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same <UNK> deadly slow pace there's low key and there's walking through it but here the cast don't even do that instead they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time you keep on hoping for paul <UNK> talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis but instead the film just stands there doing next to nothing literally this is one of the most <UNK> movies ever made  so <UNK> that if clive owen had been cast he'd almost have looked lively by comparison even a poorly explained <UNK> <UNK> attempt fails to raise a <UNK> of interest since it mostly involves yep the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness even when the bomb <UNK> goes into <UNK> before being launched they deal with the new crisis <UNK> standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world <UNK> <UNK> films have better action scenes br br things aren't much <UNK> down on earth where the movie spends most of it's running time with <UNK> son <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> trying to <UNK> a ride to the <UNK> across an <UNK> landscape with <UNK> insane desert artist looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me while <UNK> by rejects from a mad max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they <UNK> release him on a nice beach just don't expect logic if you haven't already guessed that much best moment a <UNK> girl in a bar describing jack palance as an old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather though <UNK> baby taking out the <UNK> aircraft with a <UNK> fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a <UNK> who likes his <UNK> are welcome <UNK> of camp in a film that for 99 of it's running time offers a whole lot of <UNK> richard c <UNK> slightly longer original cut that played in japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more <UNK> 17 minutes the director of <UNK> point must have <UNK> his lucky stars when the re edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film a film so bad it's not good and painfully unfunny with it
<START> i vaguely remember ben from my sci fi <UNK> days of the '60s i was doing several interviews <UNK> of obscure actors actresses most notably ben actress fay spain and <UNK> fair who played angela in <UNK> the young <UNK> ben was one of the people at a low key sci fi con in chicago about 1970 when i had a nice chat with him and his career and life all these were published in some now long forgotten <UNK> of the day wish i still had copies of those interviews but time <UNK> on and any of those people surely <UNK> remember me at all so many years later ben was a really nice fellow <UNK> out a living the cons of those days didn't even pay their guest unless of course they were big name stars and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars at most good to know ben's still alive kicking how <UNK> a remake of creature but 50 years older ugly then <UNK> now
<START> the trailers get you to the movie but the movie just wasn't worth my 8 50 it has some good effects but the storyline <UNK> i like tommy lee jones and will smith as actors they have both done some good films but i wish they hadn't added this one to their <UNK> to be honest the book is better
<START> intriguing exciting dramatic explosive complex epic words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the grand story that is lost being told br br from the acting down to the rare visual effects lost is the essential show on television for fans of science fiction fantasy action adventure and lots and lots of mystery br br each cast member is so well chosen and so good in their roles that you either love them or hate them or downright wish them dead br br the visual effects when used which is rare are actually quite well done considering the usual production of shows be it the smoke monster to the polar bears lost is believable in terms of eye candy br br as far as story goes nothing can compare to the vast complexity this show has made viewers like me endure beginning to end continuity is virtually perfect characters are developed and the ever <UNK> story slowly gives the answers to its questions so many <UNK> br br overall there is practically no flaw in lost it does for dramatic sci fi television what arrested development did for comedy it has set the bar br br i highly recommend lost to those that are patient intellectual and love every moment of the ride no matter how long it takes to reach the end br br see this show
<START> he really lost the plot with this one none of his distinctive <UNK> here at all an uninteresting plot and completely terrible acting make this his worst film in my opinion even his trademark gore is gone bar one scene in an operating theatre oh well at least his next film <UNK> <UNK> showed that he could still shock when he wanted to
<START> i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago first i'm going to say that it looks great <UNK> is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks i would not call this a horror movie putting in a few shots of a <UNK> ghost does not make it a horror movie there's no mystery there's no suspense you know who did it the entire time br br it's a drama you know what's going on with both sides the entire movie the acting was okay i guess but nothing special br br and the <UNK> revenge can be deadly really they should have check how many hundreds of horror thriller movies have that exact same <UNK> br br it pains me to say some of this but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie and i know they don't want people blowing smoke up their ass so i give my honest opinion
<START> i happily admit that i'm a sucker for a beautiful film and <UNK> inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film not one the length of <UNK> though even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography i've seen since the korean period piece <UNK> however <UNK> provides far more than just beautiful images as does <UNK> don't which to imply a contrast it's second greatest strength is superb acting and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy i must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end but it definitely <UNK> some thoughts along the way vague ones but definitely thoughts p br br one department in which the film could have been better is the action there's a tremendous amount of <UNK> in the film but the action is all filmed with <UNK> close ups and frequently <UNK> by objects in the <UNK> it does create some very intense and impressive visuals but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves something to make it more believable that the villains could just <UNK> through entire <UNK> laying waste to everyone br br still the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films i've seen for quite some time recommended
<START> the costumes and make up were grand there were some exceptionally funny lines and the role was made for jim carrey carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing sure this was mostly a movie for kids but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of dr seuss i expected more from ron howard it's worth a see but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic by any measure
<START> another downey must see if you are an obsessed fan like me you have got to see this movie he plays alex <UNK> a 22 year old <UNK> <UNK> who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier alex is the re incarnation of <UNK> <UNK> a no nonsense lawyer happily married to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is killed on their one year <UNK> when he is hit by a car he demands to go back only this time in the body of alex <UNK> enter robert downey jr a lot of confusion and a lot of laughs br br although this movie is 15 years old it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re incarnation and if so how often to you meet the same souls life after life i don't know the answer but i do know that you need to see this movie it is a riot and downey looks so good in a <UNK> this film makes you believe in love and true love never dies it just gets recycled
<START> the treasure island dvd should be required viewing in any film production course it's a <UNK> example of how not to make a movie watching the movie and then listening to the writer director's commentary demonstrates <UNK> the vast <UNK> between what he knows about the characters and what he <UNK> to his audience about them call me old fashioned but i think of movies as a means of communication and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about the director's <UNK> purpose is to make a movie void of hollywood conventions among those conventions alas is <UNK> of character and clarity of concept the director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has <UNK> avoided a hollywood cliché however he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason they are <UNK> for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly it's fine to avoid them but they need to be replaced with some other way of <UNK> the same idea not simply eliminated the film is built on an intriguing premise rich with potential two puppets are assigned to <UNK> a personality and background for an <UNK> corpse that is to be used in a <UNK> mission in the closing days of wwii soon each begins to <UNK> their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them someone with less disdain for the hollywood convention of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea this film certainly isn't it the puppets do everything they can to bring <UNK> to these characters but they are all too often defeated by the <UNK> and confused script in particular i'm becoming increasingly impressed by <UNK> who plays the lively corpse in a number of muppet films he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet
<START> i am a huge <UNK> zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to purple <UNK> as much as i wanted to like this movie i have to agree with many others who have commented on it it is very confusing and also extremely slow because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera significant portions of it are out of focus br br the film has very little dialog and what there is doesn't tell you much there are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking <UNK> or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation the way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about i still had a difficult time understanding what was going on br br i knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous <UNK> zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately i was ultimately disappointed she never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she doesn't have anything to smile about i could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as <UNK> and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find
<START> watching this stinker <UNK> cruel and <UNK> punishment at the hands of sandler truly a slow and painful death br br <UNK> the dvd in the 5 <UNK> bin at wal mart but the thought that keeps <UNK> in my head is how can i get my money back br br the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sink br br best <UNK> suggestion mystery comedy theatre you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks mystery science theatre immediately spin off a comedy program and feature this flick without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and <UNK> br br
<START> when i was six <UNK> i learned about a series called los <UNK> and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch the <UNK> and the <UNK> once every week i think that was the golden age of english series i already own the complete cycle of the prisoner but lasted also a few years later with the tomorrow people the worst witch i just me or this is harry potter in girl of course before as much as i want the <UNK> to be in zone 1 or zone 4 i'm also waiting for dr who pack the whole series in a set of <UNK> maybe 300 dvd's please i couldn't <UNK> more for it 8 people of tomorrow and several other <UNK> <UNK> but great stories to be available within my reached <UNK> i speak and understand english but not all my relatives do including my parents whom introduced me into these great stories i hope someday someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them dubbed or subtitled but in the same format i saw them remember zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set
<START> <UNK> this movie started out in an interesting manner but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull the confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so the dull comes later with a tepid romance between the two living people <UNK> both the vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film which is sad if the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber the movie might have been better br br maybe because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile as it appears that the insane <UNK> mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to <UNK> her daughter from the dead with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well take on solid human form and most likely start killing off everybody a sort of japanese mystical night of the living dead type thing but this doesn't come to pass even though this hairy <UNK> priest with a tiny basket <UNK> to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the <UNK> finishes her ritual she does just that and the only dead person who <UNK> is her daughter no mass rising of the dead no walking army of corpses nothing the priest merely makes the girl's spirit go back to the land of the dead taking the washed out <UNK> of a boyfriend with her as she'd crushed his spine like <UNK> <UNK> at which point i was tempted to cheer <UNK> as this idiot went over to kiss and <UNK> the dead girl <UNK> the <UNK> sucking <UNK> best friend has a long <UNK> shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time and that's it no real horror no real creepiness which the japanese tend to do far better than american film makers with their emphasis on over the top cheesy face make up no screaming <UNK> i was very disappointed
<START> lily mars a <UNK> girl living in indiana dreams of making it big on broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful broadway producer john <UNK> returns to his hometown for a visit lily tries everything she can to get <UNK> to notice her but he just gets annoyed with her antics when <UNK> goes back to new york to stage his show lily follows unknown to john of course and <UNK> eventually gives her a small role in his next show only as a favor to her family however <UNK> starts to fall for this young girl and a romance <UNK> which makes the show's leading lady <UNK> <UNK> jealous when <UNK> gets fed up with the john lily romance causing <UNK> with the show she leaves and john decides to make lily the star <UNK> returns later and <UNK> is forced to tell lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play which also may <UNK> the romance very charming film and a refreshing change to see garland put the comedic touches into her role her reading of lady <UNK> while supposed to be humorous never threatened her singing career i enjoyed <UNK> character <UNK> more when he was annoyed with lily rather than be the romantic the film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together but a very enjoyable film rating 7
<START> in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution <UNK> i use <UNK> for that word jean <UNK> wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic <UNK> critique of those who can't seem to get enough love if there is a message to this film and i'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben <UNK> length feature has to offer it's that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth is it possible to have two lovers some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want br br what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre jean pierre <UNK> has with the women around him he's a twenty something pseudo intellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman marie <UNK> <UNK> slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible love of his life left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who perhaps reminds him of her soon what unfolds is the most subtly <UNK> love triangle ever put on film where the psychological strings are pulled with the <UNK> words and the slightest of gestures at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre but we're mistaken the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink in br br we're told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice perhaps it was i can't say having not been alive in the period to see it first hand was that freedom led to a lack of <UNK> but <UNK> point if not entirely message is that it's practically impossible to have it both ways you can't have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate <UNK> that arrives with f ing as the characters refer over and over again br br the mother and the <UNK> strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the <UNK> the lack of <UNK> while also stimulating the intellect in the <UNK> talk you've ever seen in a movie at the same time we see a character like alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past <UNK> makes it so that the film itself isn't pretentious though it could appear to be but that it's about <UNK> what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when they're ultimately alone in the morning br br if you thought films like before sunrise sunset were talky relationship flicks you haven't met this but as <UNK> <UNK> in the dialogs these characters have sometimes trivial or <UNK> or sexual or frank or occasionally extremely or in a subdued manner emotional it's never ever uninteresting or boring on the contrary for those who can't get enough of a good talky film it's exceptional while his style doesn't call out to the <UNK> that came with his <UNK> in the <UNK> vague a dozen years beforehand <UNK> new wave touch is with the characters and then <UNK> on them br br this is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time <UNK> and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can't ever perceive them as <UNK> an emotion or going at all into melodrama it's almost too good in <UNK> realism terms but for <UNK> material there is no other way around it luckily <UNK> delivers the <UNK> chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly <UNK> as the whore <UNK> a claim she <UNK> <UNK> in the film's climax of sorts in one <UNK> shot and as another touch every so often the director will <UNK> into a quiet moment of thought of a character sitting by themselves listening to a record and in <UNK> or quiet agony this is probably the biggest influence on jim <UNK> who dedicated his film broken flowers to <UNK> and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely and lovingly in approach from the late <UNK> br br sad to say before i saw broken flowers i never heard of <UNK> or this film and <UNK> it has become quite a challenge not available on us dvd and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various <UNK> not a minute of that time was wasted the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of french relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most <UNK> <UNK> i've seen from the country in general it's complex it's sweet it's cold it's absorbing and it's very long perhaps too long it's also satisfying on the kind of level that i'd compare to scenes from a marriage true revelations about the human condition continue to <UNK> 35 years after each film's release
<START> the movie <UNK> ho ' the story of <UNK> <UNK> island <UNK> was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of american people at the duration of second world war it shows with the better way that the cinema can <UNK> body of propaganda the value of this film is only collection and no artistic in a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of robert mitchum who has a small role in the film if you want to see a film for the second world war they exist much better and objective i rated it 4 10
<START> i know some people think the movie is boring but i disagree it is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person i liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of <UNK> life a mystery captured his humanity i don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the <UNK> of someone's life but rather the <UNK> and relationships that make them interesting and what is more fascinating than someone so successfully <UNK> themselves men become what they dream you have <UNK> well good job to lord attenborough i also wanted to mention that <UNK> <UNK> really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and i hope to see him in more films
<START> shot in the heart is wonderful it brilliantly illustrates the plight of gary <UNK> a convicted murder who <UNK> death shot in the heart shows the ordeal that <UNK> family torn up by hatred went through this movie is an incredible psychological study and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting 10 10
<START> the dentist is a really good thriller and pretty disturbing i think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters vampires or zombies that's exactly why this movie is so scary during this film you'll probably think about your own dentist a few times whether he's capable of doing such things you better pray his wife doesn't cheat on him that's what the story is all about a respected dentist in la <UNK> when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool boy that must be the greatest profession in the world by the way <UNK> always take advantage of the <UNK> when the husband is at his work from then on our dentist dr feinstone can only thing about taking revenge he can't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt things aren't made easier for our dentist when he's chased by an annoying tax <UNK> a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his at one point dr feinstone can't take it anymore now he's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him the dentist is written and directed by brian <UNK> and co written by stuart gordon you can take that as a recommendation to itself these 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies and personal favorites of mine like re animator from beyond and society with the dentist they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller this film came right on time actually the decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far i'm not at all saying this is a masterpiece but it's a nice change corbin <UNK> is great as the dentist obsessed by <UNK> i remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor but he can sure handle a psychotic character the rest of the cast does good work too the woman who plays <UNK> wife is really attractive also it was great to see ken <UNK> acting again the actor from my all time favorite movie dawn of the dead plays the cop in this film <UNK> casted him in from beyond too 15 years ago and i thank him for that i don't recommend this movie to everyone if you have a weak stomach i'll advise you to skip it but if you do watch it you'll enjoy it very much you'll be disgusted but that's an extra reason i think it's been a while since i was really freaked out by watching a film it's a great topic to handle in the genre and <UNK> does it in a great way too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel my humble opinion on the dentist 8 10
<START> theo robertson has commented that <UNK> didn't adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitler's rise and wwii br br perhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8 covers this period and together with the earlier volumes in the series shows clearly the existing conditions i feel a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period joined the hitler youth even and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in <UNK> br br this documentary is so far above the history <UNK> documentaries i also own that there is no comparison br br the only fault and it is a small one that i have with <UNK> is this the numbers are not included many times for instance if you're talking about lend <UNK> then how much war material was <UNK> <UNK> how much to russia how much to <UNK> how many <UNK> ships did the u <UNK> sink and when how many ships did the german or japanese navy have total in 1941 what type were they how many troops how many troops did the allies have in total and by country lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off but i would have preferred more and naturally i always want to see more military analysis like why didn't <UNK> clark trap the german army that was at <UNK> after they had it surrounded instead of racing monty to rome and letting it escape i don't think you can begin to understand war until you've seen some of these video segments on total war like the fire bombing of <UNK> it's like trying to understand <UNK> etc before you see the clips of the death camps you just can't wrap your head around it it's too unbelievable br br unknown at that time and of course <UNK> were the most <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of the japanese including <UNK> read <UNK> and some live <UNK> of medical <UNK> prisoners w o any <UNK> br br dave
<START> i am a youth <UNK> wife and we took some youth to see this film we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them they didn't get it and i didn't enjoy it it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major <UNK> of the world the bible code the <UNK> code and the code in the <UNK> and is so questionable as to be laughable this is not a step forward for christians in the arts it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door
<START> have just finished watching this film which upset me greatly have also been to south africa twice around the time this film is set br br it is certainly hard hitting and the opening scenes tend to <UNK> the <UNK> the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break and there are certainly few light moments br br will never be able to view <UNK> <UNK> the same again he came across as a very twisted individual and i found myself <UNK> him more each time he appeared br br totally agree with steve <UNK> <UNK> and well thought out comments
<START> normally i have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you wondering to puzzle out what really happened when it's done on purpose br br but this movie really feels like they got all but the last 15 minutes done then realized they had 5 left to finish on br br i saw it on <UNK> i recommend you not spend money on it either if you catch it on tv watch all but the last 15 minutes then walk away and make your own ending in your mind br br really the movie would have been better if they had simply got away and come back with the state <UNK> of <UNK> only to find that the town and the car graveyard was gone and by all appearances had never been there br br wish i had more thumbs so i could give that movie 4 thumbs down
<START> this straight to video <UNK> is another nail in the coffin of rick <UNK> career as is the disney tradition quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash in this is a lazy <UNK> with <UNK> accidentally <UNK> himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy <UNK> which did nothing but make me <UNK> for the days of 'the incredible <UNK> man' when this kind of thing was done properly shockingly this is directed by top cinematographer dean <UNK> who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time
<START> one of the better kung fu movies but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews the movie starts out well enough with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language <UNK> which is <UNK> than you'd think for this era and make the non fight dialogue sequences passable for a kung fu movie this is a great compliment unlike other chinese action movies which were always period pieces or in the wake of jackie chan's police story i cop dramas <UNK> driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china unfortunately in the latter 1 3 of the movie it takes a <UNK> into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary br br the action is overall good featuring a duel between sammo and 1 2 of the shaw <UNK> only 2 stars <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and then a fight at the end with that <UNK> guy who always plays jet <UNK> bad guy there's only 20 minutes of combat here which is standard but what <UNK> me is the obvious <UNK> up of the camera frames i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other but there are smooth edits and then there's this it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with br br that said if you like kung fu movies my opinion here won't <UNK> you and if you don't you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this
<START> warning spoilers contained <UNK> br br this is a semi <UNK> look at what might happen to madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island there's absolutely no challenge to madonna in this role and it shows she's just madonna playing madonna and she can't even get that right i know what you're saying you're saying how do you know this is what madonna is really like you've never met her correct i haven't but we all remember truth or dare don't we i know kevin <UNK> does br br you would think in the year 2002 that madonna might have learned something one way or the other from the <UNK> ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen for <UNK> sake hasn't madonna seen <UNK> <UNK> carey showed the film world how it is done <UNK> kicks <UNK> trashy butt to the <UNK> in beauty talent screen presence charisma characterization you name it all we see from this glimpse into <UNK> world is she's the only one in it br br if there's one thing to be said for madonna it is that she's consistent when she was an mtv darling she set the world of women's fashion back 20 years now in film she has set women's roles in film and society back 20 years by <UNK> all the most hated horrible <UNK> <UNK> qualities women have been <UNK> to have locked away inside them qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don't possess br br here's the spoilers don't read any further if you don't want to know br br here's the one good thing i will say about this film and i really was impressed by it they didn't go for the hollywood ending <UNK> character lives in the typical happy hollywood ending <UNK> character would have died on the island and her long suffering <UNK> whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good decent woman a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife and they both live happily ever after but in this extremely depressing conclusion she is rescued and once more this poor victim of a husband is once again <UNK> with his demon of a wife and his life will once again become a living hell br br here <UNK> the spoilers
<START> a delightful little thriller opens with <UNK> howard in his <UNK> <UNK> and ends on a <UNK> in <UNK> it's all thrills and <UNK> as the ex spy has to <UNK> his career just as he's getting some serious r r <UNK> <UNK> how british is that br br <UNK> howard and jean simmons <UNK> from london to <UNK> upon <UNK> to <UNK> via <UNK> he's just been thrown out of <UNK> or something and she you guessed it is on the run wrongly accused of murder there's seedy <UNK> rolling lake district hills sheep country <UNK> <UNK> getting lost <UNK> a bunch of amateur <UNK> <UNK> chases and lots of <UNK> don't ask and it's all very <UNK> and <UNK> br br and a <UNK> example of british noir
<START> found this one in the video store and rented it it's one of those quirky quasi comedies that's more interesting and weird than funny it's a good one at that it reminds me a lot of being john <UNK> if you enjoyed that movie you will most likely enjoy this one
<START> this film was quite a surprise i wasn't expecting much to be honest greta <UNK> first hollywood film so what probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated arm waving and facial <UNK> that low grade silent films so often show br br well was i mistaken greta garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as she did me because this film made her a star and deservedly so she <UNK> understood the power of just standing still or of simply holding a meaningful expression for a long lingering moment so its effect could be felt and not just seen i kept thinking to myself how did this modern actress get into a <UNK> silent film she was just years and years ahead of her time br br the story isn't all that interesting it is the usual tale of love found and lost it is only the performance of garbo as <UNK> the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away that gives it life co star <UNK> cortez is <UNK> but his character is never really developed and he is <UNK> by the script throughout at one point he is made to wear <UNK> clothes leave in a <UNK> then <UNK> return and give them back and let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with garbo and then his wife way too ordinary he didn't have much of a career after this and i can understand why but he <UNK> as the somewhat <UNK> object of <UNK> obsession br br there is one utterly fantastic line in this film that just says it all <UNK> you are becoming <UNK> yes <UNK> indeed br br if you really want to know what it's all about without seeing the whole film just watch the last 30 seconds or so <UNK> glance as she sits quite alone in her <UNK> car says everything she must be so happy she has everything she wants yes <UNK> face says it all about that i have to see this one again garbo is just amazing
<START> i saw this film on tv many years ago and i saw this film when i got this on tape i thought that this was reasonably well done it was not the best of all movies but it was good enough the movie has enough talent to inspire many people especially younger kids the acting was good with danny glover leading the cast the plot line was not very believable but the script was well written this movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans it does not directly apply to a action packed sports movie it directly applies to a nice film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film overall the film was good but not great i give this a movie a 7 10
<START> i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer <UNK> it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course <UNK> at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then <UNK> i am trying for <UNK> of this film but i am unable to find it huge african lions makes appearance <UNK> his film and we will be spell <UNK> simply by the size of those animals and grace of them all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film but some scenes involving <UNK> forces <UNK> <UNK> for this film it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all
<START> the previous poster obviously worked on the movie it's a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he did mentioning all of the actors' names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that he's involved with it in some way br br it's on <UNK> right now and i was sure this was some movie where porn stars the one called <UNK> is gorgeous and well <UNK> were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reason br br also when i first saw it i was sure it was made in about 1986 and i was born in '73 so i thought i knew what i was talking about but no it was made in 1993 unbelievable br br though i would call it one of those so bad it's good movies like watching a train wreck
<START> the entire 10 15 minute presentation is done in a very non threatening and non medical way that even <UNK> children can easily understand it <UNK> many of the <UNK> surrounding <UNK> that were going around in those days 1946 while sex is not <UNK> mentioned the part about <UNK> is this is also <UNK> the first hollywood production to ever use the word <UNK> in the dialogue br br it is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day many of the betty <UNK> cartoons showed her <UNK> without revealing any defining features either max <UNK> was a bit of a card and did this with many of the betty <UNK> cartoons which required frame by frame viewing to find them br br there is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is in fact there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning <UNK> and <UNK> clark corporation br br this title is nearly impossible to <UNK> but for those who are <UNK> <UNK> it can be found out there in the <UNK> this is one of those <UNK> that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity
<START> i think the film is educational however it fails to treat the issue which <UNK> so much controversy <UNK> marriage also the film fails to reveal what the lds church <UNK> big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe i could not get a clear idea of what it is lds views are on central topics of religion br br i have many lds friends and they are nice people would have been nice to get a <UNK> picture of how they view their <UNK> more controversial statements maybe these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format but it would have been great to hear the whole story of joseph smith's truly interesting life after all it gives insight into american thought on religion in the 18th century hope they do some documentaries on this fascinating subject allowing historians to comment on smith's life we may have a mormon president some day after all smith ran for president
<START> man to man tries hard to be a good movie it has its heart at the right place it <UNK> to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate but there lies also some of the problems of this picture it <UNK> so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel <UNK> so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic man to man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is <UNK> its message in his head joseph <UNK> <UNK> this in his role he does his best to look concerned genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his <UNK> has to offer add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching but there are enough points to defend it it is entertaining has some humorous scenes and the show stealing <UNK> scott thomas of course you should not compare it to <UNK> masterpieces like the elephant man david lynch but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied it tries to grab your heart even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious and succeeds most of the time
<START> errol flynn had one of his favorite roles as the <UNK> <UNK> from a fighting irish family who went on to become the <UNK> champion of the world at a time when john l sullivan ward bond went around claiming that he could beat any man alive both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen br br <UNK> walsh has directed the colorful tale with <UNK> style capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm hearted and full of good humor all the warner contract players make up the fine cast including the always reliable alan hale as <UNK> <UNK> father proud of his son's fighting abilities and <UNK> smith who makes the most of her role as a <UNK> society girl who enjoys taking flynn down a <UNK> with <UNK> one liners dealing with his <UNK> manners br br all of the <UNK> atmosphere is captured in glorious b w although it's too bad <UNK> didn't have more faith in flynn to do the film in color he was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time engaged in a widely <UNK> rape trial that had all of the <UNK> busy <UNK> things out br br the fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen with flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of <UNK> for most of the action and the scene where bond turns over his award <UNK> to flynn at a social gathering is one of <UNK> finest moments in a long career as a character actor br br <UNK> up maintains interest all the way through whether you're a sports fan or not
<START> flight of fury starts as general tom barnes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> test flight of the x <UNK> a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible general barnes gives his top pilot colonel <UNK> steve <UNK> the job everything goes well until the x <UNK> disappears even more literally than barnes wanted as <UNK> flies it to northern afghanistan delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone vincenzo <UNK> who plans to use the x <UNK> to fly into us <UNK> <UNK> drop some bombs which will kills lots of people general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane sends in one man army john <UNK> co writer executive producer steven seagal to get it back kill all the bad guy's in the process br br this american british romanian co production was directed by michael <UNK> was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man 2006 attack force 2007 luckily someone decided the <UNK> wasn't working an unsuspecting public have thankfully been <UNK> any further <UNK> between the two apparently flight of fury is an almost scene for scene word for word remake of black thunder 1988 starring michael <UNK> with many of the same character's even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder therefore cannot compare the two flight of fury is a terrible film the poorly made written waste of time that seagal <UNK> in these days it's boring even though it's not that slow the character's are poor it's full of clichés things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent it's a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military <UNK> are being followed the action scenes are lame there's no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes it's right down there with the worst seagal has made br br flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn't even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky the quality of film changes very abruptly as it's all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in hell seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this the action scenes consist of shoot outs so badly edited it's hard to tell who is who of course seagal breaking peoples arms the whole production feels very cheap shoddy br br the imdb <UNK> this had a budget of about 12 000 000 which i think is total rubbish i mean if so where did all the money go although set in afghanistan which is a war torn <UNK> desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in romania the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan the acting is terrible as one would expect seagal looks dubbed again br br flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish is an almost scene for scene remake of another film anyway another really lazy poorly produced action thriller from seagal why do i even bother any more
<START> this film gave me nightmares for months and i'm 17 this is the scariest movie ever made that is no exaggeration i saw this movie at school in english lessons and no one else was scared which amazed me after reading other reviews i'm glad i'm not the only person who found this so scary
<START> i loved the first two movies but this movie was just a waste of time and money for me and the studio i'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can go into another house are ridiculous joe <UNK> and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny believe me this movie is just a waste of time
<START> was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film and loved every minute of the filming went to the <UNK> in london and had a great chat to phil peter martin and jon as did my wife fantastic after party too then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club what a brilliant film it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films now we have the dvd sue my wife can't get enough of it neither can the kids get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think i'm a film star now oh well one can only dream i think they are just jealous the only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather rain rain and more rain but hey we was in <UNK> hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted jon danny <UNK>
<START> i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war the ending and use of <UNK> cannon are both amazing
<START> there is nothing not to like about moonstruck i'm from a new york italian family and i actually get a little <UNK> when i watch it the actors actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days i fell in love with <UNK> because of this movie on my list of favorite movies moonstruck is number 3 it's a feel good movie where you leave the theatre <UNK> that's <UNK> or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food i'll kick you till you're dead <UNK> bring me the big knife who's dead do you love him loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can i always put moonstruck on when there's nothing good to watch because it makes me happy
<START> being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time and at the same time loving this student film parody i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted <UNK> reviews this short but sweet <UNK> has always been a crowd <UNK> at horror and science fiction movie <UNK> where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously this film is a tribute to the original not an insult it is intended to be funny and many others who i have heard <UNK> for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds especially for those of us who have seen <UNK> 50 times watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff <UNK> and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody <UNK>
<START> a beautiful <UNK> in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british <UNK> although based upon the book by robert <UNK> this initial set up is highly reminiscent of <UNK> rebecca with leading lady elizabeth taylor <UNK> with the <UNK> chief of staff at the mansion and almost immediately her own husband who is still under the thumb of his deceased but <UNK> father taylor a last minute substitute for an <UNK> <UNK> leigh looks <UNK> smooth in her high fashion wardrobe and her performance is quite strong however once husband peter <UNK> starts drinking heavily and <UNK> orders at her one might think her dedication to him rather <UNK> this feeling <UNK> the ending as well still the film offers a <UNK> lot for soap buffs romantic drama a bit of <UNK> <UNK> dance an elephant <UNK> and a perfectly timed <UNK> of <UNK> from
<START> well its about time i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this <UNK> entries while there have still been far too many drab to <UNK> entries at least this episode turned out well its rather funny that director rob <UNK> who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john <UNK> whose only scripting <UNK> to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season in right to die we are treated to the story of cliff and <UNK> at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation <UNK> has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only <UNK> and <UNK> but <UNK> is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark <UNK> and <UNK> that had <UNK> onto her catches her on fire and this is just the setup people once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not <UNK> should live in this state with no skin and only nerve <UNK> there's also a side effect too every time she <UNK> <UNK> goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so <UNK> you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever
<START> i've been willing to put up with a lot from late spring summer action fluff movies but in general that's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff i e cool special effects interesting plot twists comic value steve <UNK> etc this movie however had none of this all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva <UNK> <UNK> an issue of <UNK> is cheaper than a movie ticket there is an embarrassing lack of plot suspense back story character development continuity etc i would get into <UNK> but quite frankly i've already maybe willingly forgotten most of the movie br br the entire time i was in the theater i was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on dvd save your money on this one folks unless you really really really like eva <UNK> <UNK>
<START> excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies they couldn't live together nor apart <UNK> constantly sometimes at the same time they <UNK> and re <UNK> the past going on and on about what <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i found myself laughing at times but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were see this one
<START> this movie is plain fun i has nothing to do with the original america pie but it is fun to watch br br another try but better than band camp and the naked mile at least funnier br br just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out so i decided to call my friend and we would watch it together we had a few beers and we had fun br br you will not find any deep message in this movie but it's worth watching br br so lay back and just enjoy
<START> can any one help find out the title and artist of the song that was played at least halfway through the movie i can't remember what scene was playing the words in the song are of a <UNK> some of the lyrics go like it's <UNK> way of telling you somethings wrong it's <UNK> way of telling it in a song it's <UNK> way of <UNK> you please help me with this question thanks so much i have been searching the internet for days i can't get this song out of my mind so now this will challenge me to find some one out there who may be able to help <UNK> with this matter i wish i would of been paying attention to the scene when it was playing
<START> tough guys sexy women lots of swearing and a most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a <UNK> lake you'd think monster would be fun but it isn't really it does star tony <UNK> and john carradine however and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once in an interview with <UNK> in 1987 <UNK> <UNK> that herbert <UNK> had directed the bulk of the film but somehow kenneth <UNK> who only directed the footage featuring his children <UNK> and glenn portraying characters named <UNK> and glenn in a particularly inventive turn received full credit considering how awful the end result was <UNK> was probably glad that he hadn't been credited monster has the look and feel of a mid to late seventies tv movie which is why i like to leave it on in the background every so often as entertainment it falls flat on its face but as a reminder of another age and a <UNK> type of film making it's very effective the only thing that's missing is a car chase
<START> warning spoilers <UNK> br br tim burton <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> movie is about as sensible as <UNK> psycho oh that's right some idiot already did that i rest my case br br movie opens with <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> proving he's not that smart from the outset <UNK> mark appears in shot without his characteristic <UNK> showing then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of <UNK> br br the <UNK> establishing shot of the space station <UNK> <UNK> for no apparent reason interior of ship a <UNK> with genetic experiments on apes must we travel 1 300 million <UNK> to <UNK> to conduct these experiments the special effects team <UNK> it br br <UNK> <UNK> gets lost in that <UNK> of 60s sci fi cinema the time <UNK> <UNK> then demonstrates the space <UNK> mind <UNK> security <UNK> by stealing a <UNK> without anyone <UNK> while simultaneously <UNK> his <UNK> stupidity in <UNK> a deep space rescue mission into a worm hole for an <UNK> test <UNK> with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and <UNK> supplies br br before anyone can say pointless <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> the worm hole crashed on an alien planet removed his helmet without any thought to the <UNK> of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush <UNK> if it weren't for the <UNK> <UNK> the plastic trees br br surprise it's apes doing the chasing or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirty three years ago br br since <UNK> mark did not get to show his <UNK> take down his pants or bust his lame <UNK> rap he was <UNK> michael clarke <UNK> gorilla teeth being inserted <UNK> helped immensely in establishing his lack of character helena bonham carter aka irritating <UNK> <UNK> at a loss without a shakespearean script did a fine job of <UNK> both <UNK> and clarke as most cardboard <UNK> paul <UNK> the <UNK> slave <UNK> <UNK> the role of token comic relief and <UNK> <UNK> though i have grown <UNK> in hearing <UNK> relating to this movie one review <UNK> captured the essence of this planet of the apes re <UNK> the apes of <UNK> while everyone else <UNK> about looking like extras from one million years <UNK> or <UNK> tim roth as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> massive amounts of scenery and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic <UNK> was his character lacked a <UNK> arc <UNK> is mad when we first meet him and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end nice twist br br the original <UNK> 1968 featured a leading character charlton <UNK> taylor who was so <UNK> with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets yet as that film progressed taylor <UNK> found himself locked in a battle to prove <UNK> worth as their sole champion the original film was ultimately a tale of <UNK> not salvation when taylor discovers the statue of liberty he is forced to realize that his species had not <UNK> is there anything that cerebral or ironic to <UNK> <UNK> leo or <UNK> <UNK> no but there's lots of running br br the <UNK> cry take back the planet but it's the <UNK> planet in this movie humans and apes crash landed here together the humans having <UNK> to <UNK> allowing the apes to <UNK> speech and sensual body armor the apes deserved to <UNK> the planet along comes <UNK> mark in true <UNK> arrogance taking it for granted that humans have to be the <UNK> <UNK> simply because they're there taking it <UNK> is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 complaining a planet where men evolved from apes ' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy <UNK> br br heston was cast in the 1968 <UNK> because he had established his reputation as a maverick he was ben <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to cast him as the mute <UNK> animal in an alien society was to <UNK> an audience's expectations how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect <UNK> mark has currently only established that he has tight <UNK> br br though heston was <UNK> constantly by the ape <UNK> he dominated the screen with his charisma and <UNK> overacting when <UNK> mark tries to <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> humans it's like that <UNK> guy in school suddenly being made <UNK> <UNK> who tells you to stop drawing <UNK> on the <UNK> and you throw a shoe at him burton tries to elevate <UNK> to <UNK> icon but he comes off as a <UNK> <UNK> in the original film the apes <UNK> taylor a <UNK> yet he was to audience and apes alike an icon of humanity that irony again br br it was apt that a man who <UNK> scene chewing to an acting technique heston should play the father of this film's <UNK> scene <UNK> <UNK> roth as <UNK> ape dad charlton <UNK> his own immortal lines turned against the humans this time damn them damn them all to hell ' br br the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end while <UNK> is giving <UNK> an ass beating lesson a <UNK> <UNK> from on high with <UNK> <UNK> in it apes demonstrate their <UNK> by <UNK> in <UNK> to this <UNK> creature while <UNK> proves his own <UNK> by <UNK> let's teach these monkeys about evolution ' firstly they're not monkeys you ape secondly it was genetic <UNK> and <UNK> plot <UNK> which brought the apes to this point not evolution and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the <UNK> <UNK> is called <UNK> not evolution br br giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that <UNK> <UNK> half <UNK> role was actually integral to the plot be still my pants br br no matter that he was <UNK> last <UNK> hope in the end cop apes take <UNK> away to plot point prison where he was last heard <UNK> it's a <UNK> a <UNK> '
<START> this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it there is a sense of <UNK> <UNK> don't be surprised all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant and it doesn't get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with it never works and like its predecessors the acting is mediocre br br the plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn't fit the story had this movie ended ten minutes earlier it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught i never like this message resulting from a movie
<START> as shallow as it may sound i actually <UNK> my viewing of the <UNK> several times just because the vhs cover as well as the picture image displayed here on the website looks so incredibly gay by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isn't so much <UNK> just trashy cheesy campy and enormously fun it's almost unbelievable that <UNK> <UNK> director of cannibal holocaust of all people was the man responsible for this comical cash in on the contemporary popular sword <UNK> fantasy flicks particularly <UNK> conan movies the film opens with a terrific <UNK> upon a <UNK> type of off screen narrator introducing us to the <UNK> their <UNK> once <UNK> an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as <UNK> in other words the <UNK> are a bunch of traveling circus freaks their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy <UNK> kidnaps the <UNK> beautiful queen <UNK> and continuously attempts to discover the <UNK> of the ruby meanwhile and as some sort of amusing waste of time the two orphan twin brothers gore and <UNK> are trained to become <UNK> warriors and they're <UNK> prepared to fight each other to the death instead of that however they escape and develop a plan to free their queen actually the plot isn't half as bad as i initially feared but still the most fun is provided by the <UNK> <UNK> on screen chemistry the <UNK> inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy monsters like a dragon with <UNK> cute eyes some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp the soundtrack and make up effects are great and our almighty director <UNK> maintains a <UNK> fast pace the barbarian brother's acting <UNK> are much better than i anticipated apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross <UNK> sounds the supportive cast is splendid as well eva la <UNK> never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl <UNK> virginia <UNK> is indeed <UNK> like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely <UNK> <UNK> makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious <UNK> with a <UNK> shaped hair style i kid you not last but not least the <UNK> stars everybody's favorite eyes in the hills creep michael <UNK> as the appropriately named <UNK> i know the displayed picture looks <UNK> than a <UNK> campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people but the <UNK> really is a must see italian exploitation highlight
<START> this was the most visually stunning moving amazing and incredible story i've ever experienced quite frankly even those <UNK> just cannot describe it i can't just choose one scene that stood out for me i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the <UNK> to the crashing sound of jumping victims the reaction of people trapped in the elevator who were unaware of what was going on as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the <UNK> and finally the silence br br on that day and even now i am reminded of star wars 1977 <UNK> wan says i felt a great <UNK> in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly <UNK> ' it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description there was truly a <UNK> in the force br br this documentary vividly reveals this <UNK> the feelings are so incredibly visual the anger the frustration the shock the fear the <UNK> and the realization of its very <UNK> it's all there not a thing is missed br br this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy not just because it documents 9 11 but because it is simply everything it should be br br if you plan to watch be sure to grab a box of <UNK> you'll need them i know that i did
<START> this was the best muppet movie i've seen ever i happen to know that miss <UNK> fantasy of meeting as <UNK> was the cause of muppet babies the songs will remain in my head forever only saying so because that stupid <UNK> show hey dude song still remains in my head sorry a little off the topic there but anyway what i like is animal after the credits saying bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye <UNK> <UNK> that made me laugh so hard my absolute favorite is the play at the end i was surprised that the <UNK> street characters popped in at the wedding i'm just glad this movie was very entertaining i borrowed it from the library and now i have bought it because i can't keep the <UNK> copy forever in conclusion i <UNK> this is the best movie i've ever seen in my case it's even better than austin powers in <UNK> which was my favorite movie
<START> after seeing the poster from the film <UNK> i knew i was about to live one of those <UNK> film experiences which make me want to take my eyes out however i felt a slight optimism because the movie had a solid cast which i thought it was going to rescue the movie unfortunately that did not happen <UNK> is a horrible movie but it is not <UNK> that is the best i can say about it br br the screenplay from <UNK> written by the same guys from license to <UNK> something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies is full of cheap and predictable humor seriously i did not laugh even once watching this film besides the solid cast i previously mentioned is absolutely wasted after the big number of garbage she has been involved in like the <UNK> atrocious and <UNK> because i said so some people may think the career from diane keaton is <UNK> however it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades on films like annie hall or baby boom on <UNK> she makes her best effort with her performance but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it <UNK> shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films baby mama and <UNK> however he does what he can with his character mike white also makes a good effort but he does not reach too far away he is a very talented screenwriter like he has shown on films like the good girl and school of rock so i would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie instead of only acting on it <UNK> tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors being wasted br br the worst fail from <UNK> is being absolutely boring and unfunny its screenplay is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we have seen on sit <UNK> stay far away from this crappy comedy
<START> the morbid catholic writer gerard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that is homosexual alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of <UNK> while in the <UNK> station in <UNK> he feels a non <UNK> attraction to a handsome man that <UNK> in another train gerard is introduced to the <UNK> of the club and <UNK> christine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop <UNK> and they have one night stand on the next morning gerard sees the picture of <UNK> boyfriend herman <UNK> hoffman and he <UNK> him as the man he saw in the train station he suggests her to bring herman to her house to spend a couple of days together but with the secret intention of <UNK> the man christine travels to <UNK> to bring her boyfriend and gerard stays alone in her house he drinks <UNK> and <UNK> her safe finding three film <UNK> with names of men he decides to watch the <UNK> and discover that christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic <UNK> later gerard believes christine is a witch and question whether herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband br br the ambiguous the <UNK> man is another magnificent feature of paul verhoeven in his dutch phase the story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs magnificent performance of <UNK> <UNK> in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer and stunning cinematography the <UNK> resolution is open to interpretation like in many european movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers there are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films however paul verhoeven uses the nudity of gerard <UNK> as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out <UNK> last but not the least the <UNK> beauty of the sexy <UNK> <UNK> perfectly fits to her role of a woman that <UNK> a gay writer my vote is eight br br title brazil o <UNK> <UNK> the 4th man
<START> as the one line summary says two movies have left such a remark on me when i walked out of the theater the one was stir of echoes with kevin bacon and the second was vanilla sky br br its one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie swift you where it wants walking out of the cinema was a bit weird like that feeling you get when you are sick and cant think of anything one of those movies that you become one with the guy and feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie br br one thing is certain the actors are awesome the sound track is excellent and everything in the movie is 9 br br surely one of the best movies i ever saw and the movie that made the best and most shocking <UNK> about my life and my purpose in this world
<START> the autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart <UNK> books i have ever read it tells the amazing stories of two sisters both who earned devotion and respect working well into their 70's as a teacher and a dentist then lived another 30 years with dignity ruby dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious <UNK> <UNK> the dentist she not only expresses her anger angst and wisdom well she lets you know exactly where they've come from using an economy of words <UNK> <UNK> has the feel of the older sister the teacher down perfectly but i'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over 100 no matter the stories are well worth telling amy <UNK> is a bit too extreme and <UNK> in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the <UNK> ny times reporter this too is only a minor distraction the stories all true are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation most of them make it through just fine br br i recommend the book as essential reading to all people i recommend any books to i cannot quite but this tv movie in that <UNK> air but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right
<START> the man in the white suit like i'm all right jack takes a dim view of both labor and capital alec guinness is a scientific genius but an eccentric one he has never gotten his university degree due to an <UNK> accident in a college laboratory he manages to push himself into various industrial <UNK> in the <UNK> industry when the film begins he is in michael <UNK> company and <UNK> in a memorable moment is trying to impress his would be father in law cecil parker by showing him the ship shape firm he runs while having lunch with parker and <UNK> daughter joan <UNK> <UNK> gets a message regarding some problems about the <UNK> unexpectedly large budget problems he reads the huge <UNK> due to <UNK> experiments and <UNK> on his coffee br br guinness goes on to work at <UNK> firm and repeats the same tricks he did with <UNK> but parker discovers it too <UNK> has discovered what guinness is working on and convinces parker to continue the experiments but now <UNK> the result guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial <UNK> that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it's <UNK> structure so that for all <UNK> and purposes the <UNK> will remain in <UNK> for good any <UNK> made from it will never fade get dirty or wear out it will last forever br br guinness has support from a female shop <UNK> but not her chief he sees guinness as selling out to the rich but when he explains to them what he's done they turn against him if everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes soon <UNK> fellow <UNK> <UNK> led by <UNK> ernest <UNK> in a wonderful performance and howard marion crawford are equally panic stricken by what may end their <UNK> they seek to <UNK> the invention with only <UNK> in his corner although parker sort of <UNK> with him guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public br br in the end guinness is defeated by science as well as greed but he ends the film seeing the error in his <UNK> and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all br br it's a brilliant comedy but is the argument for <UNK> valid at one point the difficulties of making the <UNK> are shown you have to heat the threads to a high <UNK> to actually <UNK> the ends of the material to be united there is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat or contract if the owner gets thin are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever what happened to fashion changes and new styles and the cloth is only made in the color white making guinness look like a white knight we are told that color <UNK> would have to be added earlier in the process wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the <UNK> br br alas this is not a science paper but a film about the <UNK> of labor and capital in modern industry as such it is brilliant but those questions i mention keep bothering me about the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> invention
<START> the plot was quite interesting with the russian revolution background i also enjoyed seeing <UNK> as the movie was partly filmed there sadly there was zero chemistry between the 2 main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them the love scenes were forced and mechanical jordan <UNK> was really stiff almost icy rob stewart was quite charming and <UNK> so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend the ending when we finally figure out who was actually after them was quite weak and made no sense whatsoever i think i would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the 2 actors was slightly more credible
<START> omen iv 1991 was a bad made for t v movie since the 80's were over i guess the executives were <UNK> in <UNK> the drug of choice during the 90's because there is no other reason to explain this travesty why did they even bother making this a t v movie what were they <UNK> over when this one came up on the idea board did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as perhaps they thought it could make it as a series we'll never know but i know one thing this movie was the major reason why i never bought the omen trilogy they should have knocked off a couple of bucks instead of putting out this extra disc br br omen iv is basically a average american family remake of the first film instead of a <UNK> <UNK> punk kid we get the spooky girl who's a total brat to everyone around her if the family had stronger <UNK> skills then none of the demonic events that have <UNK> in the past films would have never occurred these parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline br br not recommended best to avoid at all cost
<START> having watched this movie on the scifi channel i can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives the film is an endless sequence of bizarre <UNK> or <UNK> as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me the plot isn't really worth commenting as but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into yeti territory before the movie is over we are treated to <UNK> ripping hearts out <UNK> <UNK> in an effort to run before jumping 50 <UNK> <UNK> ripping a man's legs off and beating him with them a woman killing a rabbit at 30 <UNK> with a <UNK> a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm a yeti <UNK> off a cliff by holding to a man's shoe yet then jumps off and a whole collection of further bizarre <UNK> basically if you aren't staying up on a saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of scifi channel original movies avoid this film like the plague or as my friend reading over my shoulder says it's the best movie i have ever seen to which the friend on my right says only battle <UNK> music could have made it better
<START> this movie deals with one of the most feared <UNK> <UNK> among the aging today as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of <UNK> or who are in the <UNK> stages i would suggest that every health care <UNK> recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line
<START> i've been looking for the name of this film for years i was 14 when i believe it was aired on tv in 1983 all i can remember was it was about a <UNK> girl alone having survived a plane crash and surviving the amazon i remember people were looking for her family and that she knew how to take care of herself she <UNK> the story and i vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin i don't remember much else about this movie and want to see it again if this is the same one and if any of you have a copy could you email me at <UNK> <UNK> com i'd be curious to <UNK> a copy to see if it is in fact the same film i remember it was aired on <UNK> us in 1983 and i was going through problems of my own and this film really <UNK> heavily on me thanks in advance
<START> i don't know if i'm just weird but i thoroughly enjoyed this film br br return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake in fact i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one i also thought that the cast in this movie was great judd nelson is always the best i also enjoyed the plot as a whole i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of <UNK> screenplay cabin by the lake it wasn't a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them if you're looking for some deep meaning then this film is probably not the one for you however if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours then go ahead and watch it i've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film
<START> for romantic comedies i often judge the quality of the film based upon the <UNK> of my eyes by the end of the experience unfortunately for the wedding date i can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears br br my apologies to fans of debra messing and <UNK> <UNK> but i did not see much chemistry between their two characters the premise of the film is a reverse pretty woman with <UNK> playing the role of nick a high <UNK> male <UNK> hired by <UNK> character <UNK> to <UNK> her to england for her sister's wedding a romantic relationship presumably develops between <UNK> and client but the dialogue seemed forced and artificial and there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of nick and <UNK> br br in a supporting role amy adams was a standout as <UNK> sister whenever amy came on screen she served as a spark plug and <UNK> for the film's energy perhaps if amy adams had been cast in the role of <UNK> the film might have had more <UNK> but as it turned out instead of reaching for <UNK> i was looking for the <UNK> in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance
<START> honestly barbra i know it's you who's <UNK> all those no s on my review 22 times how many people did you have to <UNK> to help you out here don't you have anything better to do like look at yourself in the mirror all day br br steven spielberg told barbra that this was the best movie i've seen since <UNK> <UNK> that pretty much says it all and serves as a dire warning br br what are the ingredients for a sure fire cinematic disaster and one that will haunt you never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain the ingredients barbra <UNK> face a musical <UNK> barbra <UNK> voice barbra streisand directing and an ultra corny idiotic premise br br hollywood is full of <UNK> this much we know in fact nearly everyone  by definition  has to be an <UNK> in hollywood why would anyone want to act for the art well if you're dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared <UNK> and streisand has the biggest ego of them all this is quite an achievement to be surrounded by <UNK> <UNK> and yet to manage to top them all  remarkable br br the movie like all her solo <UNK> is an ego trip straight out of hell every scene streisand is in is automatically ruined <UNK> but as it that weren't enough she sings a whole bunch of <UNK> songs  you know the kind that <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the celine <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> of this world to poison our precious air waves for decades now just for that she deserves not one but 100 south park episodes mocking her br br the premise streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a <UNK> sounds like a zany <UNK> comedy apart from it being a cliché the obvious problem is that streisand doesn't look like a woman nor does she look like a man  in fact i'm not even sure she's human the way she looks in this movie <UNK> it cannot be described in words e t looks like a high school jock by comparison she looks more alien than michael jackson in the year <UNK> she looks horrible br br the songs they made me <UNK> particularly <UNK> can you hear me <UNK> like a demented female <UNK> in heat and tomorrow night i'll prepare the sequel <UNK> 2 the return of the bitch br br did you know that streisand considered having a nose job early on in her career but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change can you believe that she should have done it killing two flies with one <UNK> that's what it would have been br br if you're interested in reading my <UNK> of barbra streisand and other hollywood <UNK> contact me by e mail br br should barbra streisand finally go into retirement click yes or no
<START> this comic book style film is funny has nicely paced action and a great futuristic style to it writer steven de <UNK> who also wrote <UNK> gives arnie plenty of lines to dish out send me a copy after <UNK> a contract and stabbing a pen into the lawyers back what a pain in the neck after <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> wire he had to split after <UNK> his body between his legs and finally as <UNK> <UNK> through a <UNK> bearing his own face arnie concludes now that hit the spot <UNK> enough bears some similarities total recall another sci fi flick starring <UNK>
<START> as many agree origin is a beautiful anime artistically the music graphics and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works however if you are looking for more than this than i suggest looking else where the beauty stops short of its appearance and when it really comes down to plot and characters there's nothing special action is slow and minimal and the people are flat corny at times and do not act realistically not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there so in summary oh my goodness i've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one and oh my goodness it's like poke people don't act like that it took a giant step forward in graphics and music in anime but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization and unfortunately there's not even that much action to make up for that
<START> the acting was bad the script was bad and the ending was just terrible the only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make up but apart from that this movie would be one of the worst movies of 2001 why on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it why
<START> i've seen better production quality on youtube i pity the actors as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking not sure how they could get the lines out i really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were the characters were not developed at all and there was no real <UNK> in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much it's a shame really as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality direction and script it could have been a decent movie it certainly was not a comedy unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing which was amateurish even the english actors sounded weird
<START> obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din the characters that grant mclaglen and fairbanks play are just <UNK> of han solo luke skywalker and <UNK> even sam <UNK> gunga din <UNK> into c <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and like him or not jar jar <UNK> br br today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by <UNK> <UNK> as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be <UNK> in the sentiments of many today br br to a young boy this was a great film three strong male leads and only a hint of romance there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday <UNK> film was just <UNK> not like today when the more skin is <UNK> with delight too late to <UNK> lost innocence br br hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action adventure and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors
<START> the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies <UNK> is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen <UNK> until i saw the imdb profile i can't say anything bad about peter <UNK> he's one of my favorite actors i love anne rice i'm currently reading the vampire chronicles but i'm glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little too real for me i prefer <UNK> and <UNK> witty little <UNK> to the struggles of slaves <UNK> <UNK> was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but i don't want to give anything away sorry but it's just not my type of show
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time not just the story but the acting is shockingly bad the dialog sounds like someone reading the news br br this is rated as comedy drama romance it's not of those things it's a little action that's it there's really no comedy and drama at all br br if you went to the cinema to see this i feel sorry for you i would not recommend it at all pretty much anything else that you choose to look at will be better this is pretty much a action crime movie the actions scenes sucked and crime story part of it was very predictable br br if you are not really interested in a good story or good acting and you simply want to look at a <UNK> film for the appeal of being foreign then this might be for you
<START> <UNK> master of the flying <UNK> is an amazing and wonderful film to watch this isn't because the fighting is particularly inspired or because the film makes any sense at all it's because the film is so silly and so over the top that it is a camp classic bad but <UNK> bad the film stars a blind guy who has a <UNK> like device on a chain that chops off people's heads as he expertly throws this at his <UNK> who cares that the physics are impossible or that the film features such silly things as fighters with 12 foot long <UNK> <UNK> arms or that the guy was blind it's just a ball to watch from start to finish and one of my favorite bad films and great to see with friends br br because of this film i was eager to see the fatal flying <UNK> 1977 though sadly it turned out not to be a sequel but a bit of a knock off taking many of the ideas from the original but <UNK> to make the film as coherent or watchable sure it's silly fun but it never comes close to master of the flying <UNK> in entertainment value like the original film there are these weird flying devices that <UNK> heads but they are quite different with <UNK> saw <UNK> and almost a mind of their own there also is no blind guy but instead are a bunch of baddies who really have no depth nor does the audience understand exactly what's occurring in this english dubbed version as the plot is completely incomprehensible however at the same time some of the martial arts action is very good while not up to the high standards of most bruce lee or sonny chiba films the action is worthwhile despite the ludicrous and often confusing plot br br overall this is a film that martial arts fans may like despite its many many many many shortcomings but also one that others will probably turn off or laugh hysterically at instead of enjoying the action because the film is just so ludicrous but most importantly it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as master of the flying <UNK> too bad
<START> riding giants is an incredible documentary <UNK> the history and stories of three influential big wave surfers <UNK> <UNK> jeff clark and <UNK> hamilton <UNK> <UNK> did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be <UNK> for doing such a brilliant job the structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration interviews animation and surfing footage the music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film making riding giants brilliant viewing personal highlights include any of greg <UNK> comments what with his straight to the point <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> footage at <UNK> and the out takes at the end of the movie but really this entire film is one big recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see it's a shame it isn't more well known but it is a gem deserving of attention 10 10
<START> red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night intense acting great villain and unexpected action br br some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 <UNK> and <UNK> of the movie is on a plane and just talking don't worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog br br a pg 13 movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller br br this movies strongest point is its cast this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills if they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding <UNK> cillian murphy from batman begins and 28 days later <UNK> off this cast is brian cox from x men 2 br br the pacing in this film was great just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you luckily this isn't a long movie and doesn't feel like it either much better then the other flight movie flight plan br br here is my flight plan comment http www imdb com title <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i recommend not too long and not too <UNK> br br 8 10
<START> <UNK> santa or angel of death is a very weak movie mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots <UNK> in people mira has an italian accent which <UNK> from time to time couldn't she just speak english all the other characters have a forced mexican english accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but that's not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers br br during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the <UNK> that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
<START> i've now watched all four bo derek vehicles directed by her husband john all are quite terrible of course but this is certainly the <UNK> featuring the usual flimsy plot bad scripting  by the director naturally  and acting not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star it deals with her losing much older husband anthony quinn she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired <UNK> but who continues to appear and talk to her in fact he wants to come back in another younger <UNK> actually does so only in the very last scene derek is lovely as always and still playing <UNK>  especially during a muddled mid section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a <UNK> quinn too is typically larger than life read hammy here but this easily <UNK> his <UNK> besides for much of the duration he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic presumably suggesting his being in some sort of <UNK> his <UNK> then is obviously a handsome looking stud who hasn't a <UNK> of talent or even personality also featured in the cast are hollywood veterans don murray as <UNK> best friend and <UNK> business <UNK> and julie <UNK> as <UNK> guardian angel in the <UNK>  plus a surprising cameo appearance by <UNK> donald <UNK> who presumably needed this on his <UNK> it also goes without saying that john derek was his own cinematographer on the film that the end credits are filled with useless and corny expressions of <UNK> to the many people who <UNK> a helping hand and that ghosts can't do it swept the board at the 1990 <UNK> awards
<START> spoilers the one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one of the worst <UNK> jobs ever that and the magnificent <UNK> <UNK> on the old evil dude who was trying to steal <UNK> invention mst3k does an admirable job of making a <UNK> boring and grey film funny i particularly like it when crow kills mike with his <UNK> of <UNK> and when he <UNK> him in the theatre mike cries guys i died i saw eternal truth and beauty oh it's this movie that would be a letdown having to come back from the <UNK> to watch the rest of the projected man the film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep <UNK> some of the <UNK> in the film were wicked police inspector <UNK> crow shocking isn't it police inspector that's lowe all right tom <UNK> very low right down by the floor police inspector can i get on tom <UNK> he's dead but knock yourself out mst3k is definitely the only way to watch this <UNK>
<START> alright i got passed the horrible acting i got passed the fact that <UNK> kim was <UNK> some <UNK> and her arms or hands weren't moving i got passed the weaves i got passed the colored contacts br br this is what killed it for me in the scene where the four <UNK> were sitting at the table arguing lisa <UNK> and monica <UNK> stand up and and then <UNK> kim gets up to break up any <UNK> by saying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hold up let's chill out here for a hot second i am a fan of the western movie genre and i never heard anyone talk <UNK> like this in any of clint eastwood's movies br br if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating please tell me another movie that's worse than gang of <UNK> br br i'm through
<START> new york i love you finally makes it to our <UNK> but its 10 short stories on love somehow didn't find reason enough to be released over <UNK> probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on <UNK> new year and with that comes the usual <UNK> blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan no not the spy next door and local filmmaker jack neo who has <UNK> released his latest film over that period to <UNK> success so why fix a formula that hasn't been broken br br continuing in concept where paris je t'aime had begun in <UNK> the city of love franchise shanghai will be next so says the end of the closing credits here the buzz here is definitely about the <UNK> stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the <UNK> points in the <UNK> ground rules and her short was <UNK> dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else well it was shot in black and white but here's hoping that it would make it to the dvd at least br br <UNK> this series is less <UNK> compared to its predecessor which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created here a little more <UNK> is given where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together and not just solely <UNK> on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes in hopes of making things look a little bit more <UNK> with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers though one story <UNK> adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise though already seen in paris br br one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one is definitely the creative forces behind the stories from writers directors and <UNK> from various <UNK> and backgrounds <UNK> the makeup of the <UNK> city coming together for a concept film and what more the star <UNK> cast too with big names amongst the lesser known ones all <UNK> the <UNK> through picture perfect performances be it for the entire length of the short or as a support to build upon you can't deny the initial star <UNK> in <UNK> the <UNK> from <UNK> khan to natalie portman who also had writing and directing duties rachel <UNK> looking quite like <UNK> to spielberg's blue eye boy <UNK> <UNK> who surprisingly can act and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date br br story wise like any anthology you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you and with others that don't some are straightforward in nature while others have to come up with <UNK> twists that thankfully worked but these 10 stories plus 1 because randall <UNK> was given duties to <UNK> everything together for a more <UNK> feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established <UNK> somehow lacked the more anything goes spirit from its predecessor with stories more <UNK> in reality compared to some <UNK> elements in the previous film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a vampire anyone or even less adventurous with its narrative style christopher <UNK> and tom <UNK> starring natalie portman here it seemed that the filmmakers <UNK> very much for safe with none <UNK> into that spirit of adventure and experiment br br minor <UNK> aside i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here contrary to what many others have felt about it the short film format is still very much alive and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love <UNK> works fine and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its <UNK> i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be <UNK> together a <UNK> i love you so here's crossing my fingers that maybe something will <UNK> down the road otherwise there's always the <UNK> <UNK> route of just making it without any <UNK> to franchise house rules
<START> <UNK> <UNK> multi layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen but the resulting movie is filled with passion emotion humour and pathos the story is somewhat slow moving but there is always something on the screen to <UNK> the audience the movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with <UNK> accuracy all of the actors are indian few if any known to western audiences but they are a joy to behold especially the little girl who acts very convincingly don't be put off by the title and plot summary this is a movie to be seen on the big screen we have much to learn from it
<START> level one horror br br when i saw this film for the first time at 10 i knew it would give me nightmares it did surprisingly as i recall it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them br br level two <UNK> theory br br later as an adult i saw the story for what it was what if the savage <UNK> instincts we all <UNK> became <UNK> br br level three pure science fiction br br the best way <UNK> to realize the <UNK> what if is through the science fiction genre this is pure science fiction not the <UNK> in space that passes for the genre today br br after <UNK> years forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films if planning a remake <UNK> or lucas watch out
<START> i honestly had no idea that the notorious b i g bert i gordon the director not the murdered <UNK> was still active in the 80's i always presumed the deliciously inept empire of the ants stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty vhs copy of the coming a totally obscure and <UNK> of <UNK> movie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise what starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late dark ages soon takes a silly turn when a <UNK> of year <UNK> inexplicably becomes transferred to present day <UNK> <UNK> and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum for you see this particular girl is the reincarnation of ann <UNK> who was a <UNK> <UNK> evil girl in <UNK> and <UNK> accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their <UNK> at the state the man who attacked <UNK> lost his wife and daughter this and wants his <UNK> revenge but poor and three centuries older <UNK> is just an innocent <UNK>  or is she burned at the stake unfolds like a mixture between the exorcist and <UNK> general with a tad bit of the time machine thrown in for good measure way to go bert the plot becomes <UNK> and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never <UNK> into complete boredom like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like the <UNK> horror and the <UNK> terror the film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of <UNK> which keeps it rather amusing and fast paced the ann <UNK> girl is quite a fascinating character reminiscent of the <UNK> williams character in the more <UNK> known stage play the <UNK> also depicted by <UNK> <UNK> in the 1996 motion picture there are a couple of cool death sequences like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library that are committed by the ghost of <UNK> <UNK> who made a <UNK> with ann <UNK> and perhaps even the devil himself the film gets pretty <UNK> and completely absurd near the end but overall there's some good cheesy fun to be had plus the least you can say about bert i gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial <UNK> over the years
<START> this is easily one of the worst 5 movies i've ever seen it's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline this movie is <UNK> slow and i was bored for almost all 98 minutes while the acting is mediocre at best the biggest problem is the script which is poorly written slow and plodding with no real direction occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event i'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots they did after all have to try and <UNK> a terrible script as a huge fan of good horror movies i'm always irritated that something this bad gets made save yourself 98 minutes you'll never get back
<START> this is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting i never tire of watching it i especially love the scene where danny <UNK> character and kevin <UNK> character namely simon and mack have <UNK> together kevin kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are <UNK> and one you would encounter often so its a very <UNK> movie br br one of the most powerful scenes in the movie however is at the beginning of the movie when simon arrives at the scene where <UNK> car has broken down the movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there's one person preaching his guts out to an audience instead the actors' emotions and situations deliver an <UNK> message that does best without the use of words and lastly mary <UNK> is brilliant as always
<START> a critical and financial flop when first release the critics have turned around and stated that this film <UNK> of the director's best a la <UNK> like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency ben <UNK> john ritter and <UNK> novak <UNK> fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film audrey hepburn <UNK> camp dorothy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> much of the script was ad <UNK> or re written on the day of shooting which gives the film a <UNK> feel ben <UNK> is excellent as the head detective <UNK> audrey hepburn after dropping singer <UNK> camp and seeing cab driver <UNK> <UNK> on the side john ritter <UNK> follows dorothy <UNK> and immediately falls in love with her <UNK> novak has a few girls he is chasing including <UNK> <UNK> and elizabeth <UNK> this film has some great performances by a <UNK> cast <UNK> are audrey hepburn she doesn't have a line in the first half of the film ben <UNK> has never been better and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead and <UNK> camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a rat a <UNK> <UNK> delivery highly recommended stars
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i was fifteen when this movie came out and i could relate this will be a movie i would show my kids to let them know the feelings they are having are normal it is funny to see how we could be so <UNK> by things at such a young age who knew that we would <UNK> back again and again great movie
<START> this movie can be described in those 2 words just unbelievable this is the best movie ever made i just cant see why this movie <UNK> in the top 250 i also can't see why anybody would not love scarface anyways if you <UNK> seen it it is a must buy
<START> i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel so i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed i knew i wouldn't like the movie but i was not expecting to be <UNK> by the use of <UNK> digital video the movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these <UNK> digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots but there seemed to be no logical explanation warning the following maybe a spoiler the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous i can only <UNK> return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing but <UNK> at 4 <UNK> in the morning
<START> dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris <UNK> trying to maintain a low profile eventually <UNK> into an uninspired version of the three <UNK> only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob <UNK> character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey <UNK>
<START> the greatest games of <UNK> or <UNK> can be a mess for a total rookie this is a great movie there is no special agency involved in the plot this is the clue this is a private plot built as a private enterprise this is a self destructive and a self organized plot as a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot private self <UNK> self destructive with no trace at the end anyone can be behind the plot a smart director with some money all can be done just by <UNK> the director must be just trigger if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered all the actors' performances are well done with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney
<START> hmmm a sports team is in a plane crash gets stranded on a snowy mountain and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions in order to survive sound familiar anyone i refer to alive from 1993 the only major difference here of course is that a big white drunken scare crow of a yeti shows up a few times to drag off the dead i guess humans taste better than <UNK> br br stupid the man in the first scene does not have a reliable <UNK> when hunting the yeti nor does he have a <UNK> br br the plane crash is completely bogus it would have either <UNK> in the air <UNK> when it hit the ground or become <UNK> the people would not have survived but hey it's sci fi br br stupid they survived and they are cold it might be a good idea to <UNK> some of the burning <UNK> nearby so as not to freeze to death fire being warm as it is br br wtf the pilot has frost formed all over his face while he's alive and talking but oddly enough no one else does br br stupid one of the guys tells the others to look for matches and <UNK> but there are scattered parts of the plane on fire all around them br br stupid they find <UNK> and <UNK> and yet there in the cold of the <UNK> they fail to use the <UNK> br br stupid they're staring at a pile of sticks when i <UNK> there are pieces of the plane already burning br br stupid the <UNK> are notorious for its <UNK> it would be common sense for them to collect the <UNK> in order to <UNK> their structure rather than sitting outside <UNK> there are a lot of <UNK> trees around the <UNK> of which make excellent <UNK> br br wtf when in doubt use a dead man's arm as a <UNK> br br wtf if the one guy knows so much about the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> bears and <UNK> in the <UNK> then why doesn't he know enough to make shelter and set traps right from the start br br stupid when attempting to trap wild animals mindless conversation in the <UNK> of said trap always helps br br wtf do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a <UNK> of glass br br wtf the group was ready and armed to fight the yeti while the other two were standing there <UNK> the yeti ripped out the guy's heart and <UNK> the girl's head and the gang did nothing there's love br br so two <UNK> and a convenient <UNK> to bury the evidence forever or so we think <UNK> the story continues into more idiocy but the most action occurs in the last 15 minutes as usual nice thinking with the <UNK> and the chain although this is some <UNK> with the magically appearing chain that they lacked in the beginning of the movie when they couldn't even make fire despite the fact that it was all around them br br as is typical for the sci fi originals the loving couple kisses at the end like nothing horrible has just happened to them not to mention they ate human flesh and haven't <UNK> their teeth in several days br br the very end however is quote lame
<START> a note to all of you budding film writers study this film if your dialog reads like the dialog in this film please shred your script and try again br br i didn't have high expectations but was intrigued by the description <UNK> there was a mystery at the christmas <UNK> factory the mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance i almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes 10 minutes and at the first break my <UNK> who is the hallmark lifetime fan gave up at the first break br br forest river is a company town the main business is <UNK> <UNK> who make all manner of holiday <UNK> the <UNK> of the company has recently passed away so the companies future might be in question we soon meet <UNK> who would rather be on wall street than main street and the mysterious justin who gets a date with <UNK> after a large snowman she is <UNK> crashes into <UNK> car once we meet alison <UNK> doing due <UNK> for the board we have our story setup br br if you can't nail all the story <UNK> by the first commercial break you haven't seen enough of this kind of holiday film maybe that's a good thing
<START> the poverty row horror pictures of the 1930s and <UNK> <UNK> the hell out of me god knows i have nothing against low budget films but the ones produced in that period have such a dreary <UNK> look about them and in the final analysis just aren't very good the corpse <UNK> is slightly more entertaining than bottom of the barrel dreck like the invisible ghost and the ape man but it's no classic bela lugosi long past his dracula <UNK> plays yet another mad doctor the unbearable elizabeth russell plays his wife they sleep in <UNK> because as lugosi explains to a <UNK> young female reporter <UNK> <UNK> a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed ho hum <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are also on hand which might please hardcore fans of <UNK> and <UNK> films
<START> a lot has been said about <UNK> <UNK> society as the first true miike film and i thought this sort of description might have been a cliché but like all clichés it is based on the truth all the miike <UNK> are here the violence the black humour the homosexuality the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character <UNK> is however one of miike's most perfectly formed films he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different but not necessarily better i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not <UNK> or better the <UNK> of this film br br as you might expect the violence is utterly visceral <UNK> blood and gritty <UNK> are <UNK> by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair <UNK> over her face only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that the film has a fantastic pace unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and <UNK> in the middle dead or alive also deals with similar issues miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the <UNK> period and this <UNK> subject is handled well here the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past br br i cannot sing <UNK> <UNK> enough i do not want to give away too much this is miike before he began to use cgi to <UNK> his films and is almost reminiscent of something like <UNK> <UNK> the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist <UNK> that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out
<START> i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie i thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better the acting the music drowning out the actors horrible save your money you have to read the movie all the way through b c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines i never got the part about the <UNK> or the need to continue to show <UNK> and pigs being butchered what did that have to do with the real btk killer i understand why there were no famous actors actresses in this movie the script would have turned me away within the first page of reading you would be better off watching paint dry
<START> it is very unfortunate when a movie such as this is made a great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at best br br the editing drags on there are obvious mistakes that could have been <UNK> easily in a second take and the soundtrack is unimaginative so much more could have been done with this video movie i guess they ran out of time or <UNK> br br hand held shots have a distinct amateur feel to them
<START> <UNK> just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to just as simple as that and he succeeded not only in his goal but also in making a wonderful movie especially visually he knows how to use pans slow motion sequences tracking shots <UNK> shots etc in a beautiful smooth way this gives the movie a very relaxing feel to it br br the story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing a party that they all attend to which also is the <UNK> of this movie the beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on <UNK> in <UNK> with a similar of course better movie like <UNK> i simply don't think that that was <UNK> idea the beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through which makes or breaks their lives <UNK> is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences he knows people and <UNK> br br the soundtrack of the movie is also excellent but not a surprise as we know that <UNK> is also a very <UNK> <UNK> and musician with his band <UNK> the music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunny smooth feel of the movie other times we hear funky pop rock <UNK> which give some scenes the strength that they need br br there's only one flaw and that's the last half an hour was it the runtime which was breaking me up or weren't the last scenes that fresh and accurate than the scenes until then i can't figure it out br br all in all a beautiful sunny movie which lifts the <UNK> cinema up br br 8 out of 10 br br it's the <UNK> that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful it's the fresh <UNK> that makes you relax when it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door it's the <UNK> that carries the <UNK> from that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park who you just met a week ago it's the <UNK> br br
<START> this is a rather dull movie about a scientist that creates a <UNK> device and gets horribly <UNK> when he uses the machine to transport himself simple plot done before in the fly and others not only does he get <UNK> but he also can <UNK> people with a touch what is really dumb about this film is that we are expected to believe the place this guy works is against him he could probably make millions for the institution that he is working at but the head of the institution tries to <UNK> his <UNK> every step of the way in the end the projected man <UNK> three people for no reason then goes after those that have <UNK> him
<START> if you made a genre flick in the late 80s you basically had a 50 50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison sadly we never got an underwater prison flick framed for murder by mafia boss <UNK> anthony <UNK> derek <UNK> dennis cole ends up on death row right alongside the mob <UNK> brother frankie frank <UNK> jr but this is the least of <UNK> problems as rogue government agent and mob <UNK> <UNK> burgess john <UNK> who also directs is using the prison as a testing ground for a new <UNK> this is the only flick <UNK> directed during his <UNK> career for a guy who has worked with tons of directors it appears the only ones he picked up any <UNK> from were the cheap o italian ones sure it is low budget but that can't excuse the stilted staging shooting <UNK> or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes to his credit <UNK> did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to <UNK> about a female scientist cole who looks like a more rugged jan michael vincent is decent as the stoic lead and <UNK> sporting a really bad <UNK> gives it his all as the cliché mob boss the end takes place at marty <UNK> favorite location bronson canyon <UNK> released this on dvd as zombie death house
<START> after all the crap that hollywood and the <UNK> have <UNK> out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments there are some clichéd moments but i'm not sure it's possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie there's not much new here it's just done well br br make sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often this is not a movie to watch while you're eating pizza br br there's one very well written red <UNK> in this movie and unfortunately one very poorly cast role <UNK> christian just doesn't make an effective julie the wife mother for one thing she's totally unsympathetic i know i know she's just gone through a traumatic experience but the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather <UNK> in an unintentional way i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but i never did br br finally a thumbs up for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying it could easily have been <UNK> with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director wisely <UNK> br br this is not a masterpiece by any means but it is a good old fashioned scary movie something that's rather rare nowadays
<START> this movie raises a number of <UNK> questions in my mind firstly how has jennifer <UNK> managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous <UNK> voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs secondly what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of and <UNK> given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this shouldn't there have been someone in the system the studio the <UNK> or somewhere sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released you really would have to search a very very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this and it isn't even billed as a horror movie which <UNK> as it can be seen as <UNK> to any legitimate film genre it certainly is the movie <UNK> from beginning to end in the <UNK> kind of madness violence and abuse and has essentially no redeeming features at all i'm not actually <UNK> censorship which i don't believe in but i really can't see how anybody could <UNK> draw anything positive from watching a film like this
<START> this was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there but the casting decisions completely <UNK> the movie hanks is a great actor to be sure but lacks the smarmy morally <UNK> characteristics needed for the lead role jeff daniels would have been my choice br br putting <UNK> <UNK> in for eye candy reasons is understandable but again she did not portray the depth or <UNK> so need to pull this off br br this movie is a great example of how every decision even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file
<START> spoilers br br this movie always seems very exaggerated until i remember that my college campus had a former student turned nazi racist killer who then committed suicide too his name was benjamin <UNK> smith br br look him up in the <UNK> i added a few photos to their article about him br br it's hard to believe but this stuff really does happen br br i'm not a big fan of omar <UNK> or ice cube but larry fishburne <UNK> <UNK> jennifer <UNK> mike <UNK> were good
<START> they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love the only thing worse is the film itself the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play <UNK> at one point when the wife leaves the husband a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack no kidding the actors try but are defeated by the inept unbelievably terrible script direction is <UNK> bad no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation how do things like this get made i'm turning off the television before it's over
<START> i've almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie my belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be <UNK> however things have quickly changed after watching that horrible black no songs this movie page 3 plenty of songs while black was weak to an extreme page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting good direction the songs were almost incidental <UNK> in almost <UNK> with the film there certainly weren't any women getting <UNK> with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while <UNK> wildly on the streets at night br br i was pleasantly surprised with the bold and <UNK> approach used by the director there was no <UNK> over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable br br i'd recommend this films for hindi speaking people with at least a slight understanding of <UNK> life the former because the english <UNK> was below par and contained many errors which at times completely <UNK> the meaning of the actual statement the latter because you'll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you've lived it yourself br br i'd definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition the scenes with the <UNK> drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole <UNK> the movie does fall short in a few places though where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film br br i also thought that a couple of the <UNK> scenes were not done very well it was a touch amusing to watch rather than <UNK> any feelings of sadness the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish these are minor issues though because the film on the whole is truly a rare treat to watch br br overall it's a cynical <UNK> <UNK> and a refreshing one at that actors not <UNK> that's the key a chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting everyday life a behind the scenes look at the extent of the <UNK> and a rare ray of hope for indian cinema br br 8 10
<START> after the success of scooby doo where are you they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show but unfortunately they added a new character that <UNK> scooby doo success forever they invented a new show with a new title scooby and <UNK> doo it was <UNK> doo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together <UNK> was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him scooby doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy <UNK> if they wanted scooby doo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up <UNK> this was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it
<START> based on the average short story by horror writer stephen king about so called <UNK> ancient and immortal cat like creatures that suck the life out of <UNK> in order that this energy may sustain them they have supernatural abilities they can make themselves <UNK> which means they become invisible and can create <UNK> <UNK> to fool people they have been fleeing humans for <UNK> we are told and have one by one been picked off till there are only two left the film starts when a beautiful mother and her son arrive in a sleepy town they are the last of the <UNK> and they are on the <UNK> for <UNK> to feed on the mother sends her son out to <UNK> at the local high school so he can find a virgin he does <UNK> <UNK> and proceeds to try to get her alone so he can suck her dry it is not made clear why the mother cannot seek out <UNK> herself it would make things easier one would imagine as teenage boys are much more apt to follow a older beautiful woman to a secluded area than a teen girl follow a teen boy however his plans are <UNK> as the girl fights back <UNK> a <UNK> in to his ear the police are called and the hunt is on the son is sick from his <UNK> and so the mother goes on the rampage killing cops left and right in her hunt for the girl who hurt her son and <UNK> some painfully unfunny one liners amidst the gore finally the girl kills the mother end of movie this movie is rubbish the acting is <UNK> from the average brian <UNK> to the excellent alice <UNK> the special effects are average and showcase some early computer effects which is mildly interesting as it shows how far such things have progressed in such a short time the direction is muddled and the film falls in to camp in places the director seems unsure whether we are supposed to fear the <UNK> or <UNK> with them and when in doubt allows the film to become hysterical stephen king makes a mildly amusing cameo as an annoying <UNK> as does mark <UNK> as a puzzled cop alice <UNK> seems to shoulder the film her character is given depth and she gives an indication of what the film could have been with a better screenplay and better direction
<START> camera work why is the camera work in this movie so <UNK> this is annoying and distracting editing the flashes of the still pictures were way too short many of the other scenes were too short also just flashes sound the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices one should not have to <UNK> and replay to catch what was said doesn't anybody check these things and make them do it over again please <UNK> the volume of the background music in future is <UNK> of the relative sound levels the job of the editor julia wong the plot had way too many loose ends the basic story line had potential i think the film needed more work was it rushed perhaps they ran out of money like a lot of movies it started out great but just <UNK> out toward the end i really don't understand this you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn't all the loose ends get taken care of in the <UNK> br br sorry to be so critical
<START> this utterly dull senseless pointless <UNK> and dumb movie isn't the final proof that the world can forget about danny boyle and his post <UNK> movies the beach already took care of that what this low budget <UNK> does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs booze ego self <UNK> bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once promising director's quick demise br br the premise is absurd two losers <UNK> and some bimbo jenna g a <UNK> likely meet by chance and <UNK> start singing with <UNK> more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit making duo which they become a friend of theirs an even bigger illiterate loser becomes their manager by <UNK> a store window and stealing a video camera by which he films them in action and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage now i know that the uk in recent years has put out incredible junk but this is ridiculous the music makes <UNK> seem like the beatles during the studio <UNK> the duo <UNK> change lyrics in every take and <UNK> quite <UNK> tells the music <UNK> guys to take it or leave it and quite <UNK> they do take it not only is the music total and utter trash but its performers are anti social these <UNK> are supposed to be calling the shots it's just too dumb it's plain awful br br the dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere and this <UNK> to <UNK> story has no point and makes no sense it often feels improvised under the influence of drugs danny boyle is a complete idiot this little piece of trash is so bad it's embarrassing to watch <UNK> i q also has to be <UNK> for <UNK> to be part of this nonsense whoever <UNK> this <UNK> joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street <UNK>
<START> oh my god the worst sh t i've ever seen this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie and i really do not understand anybody with opposite myth though maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable i especially mean the role of h graham what was that in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers the character was played in affected and annoying way every time she appears it reminds that <UNK> re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion terrible don't waste your time
<START> if you like sci fi monsters and ancient legends then you will love this movie br br the special effects are by far the best i have seen since <UNK> park hit the big screen years ago while the acting may have been a little less than <UNK> the story line and effects adequately <UNK> for it br br i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our <UNK> inch big screen tv br br if you like non stop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and <UNK> you have to see this movie
<START> i enjoyed this film very much <UNK> maguire gives a terrific performance as jake he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all i did not know what to expect from <UNK> performance but i think she did rather well lots of exciting scenes a thoroughly good ride i am absolutely a fan of <UNK> check out <UNK> house rules one of the all time best ever
<START> many people thought that this is a good movie but i don't agree with them at the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason also it is in a dark forest i can't see anything on the screen i can only hardly hear the sound br br after a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent <UNK> to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a <UNK> finally the predator found the <UNK> of the aliens and killed it for no reason he was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here lastly the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long the summary is too short and it can't tell the reviewers about the story clearly br br in conclusion i don't think this is a good movie
<START> <UNK> is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary <UNK> of vienna it comes from former documentary director <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> a very documentary like approach to the material however the film <UNK> away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as extremes  some are extremely lonely some extremely violent some extremely weird some extremely <UNK> some extremely frustrated and misunderstood and so on the film combines several near plot less episodes which <UNK> from time to time each following the characters over a couple of days during a <UNK> <UNK> summer very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people the many <UNK> that plague our society in general it is a thought provoking film and its conclusions are pretty <UNK> on the whole br br a <UNK> old widower <UNK> about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a <UNK> for him while wearing his deceased wife's clothes a nightclub dancer <UNK> with the <UNK> jealous and violent behaviour of her boy <UNK> boyfriend a couple <UNK> over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek <UNK> by having sex with other people an abusive man <UNK> his woman but she <UNK> him time and again a security salesman desperately tries to find the <UNK> behind some <UNK> on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent <UNK> and a mentally ill woman keeps <UNK> rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car the lives of these <UNK> characters <UNK> over several days during an intense summer heat wave br br the despair in the film is <UNK> many scenes are <UNK> by long awkward <UNK> that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on screen events leave you <UNK> in particular a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female <UNK> <UNK> to the mercy of a vengeful guy to be beaten raped and <UNK> thankfully all off screen for some <UNK> she didn't even do <UNK> a sour almost angry taste in another scene a man has a lit candle <UNK> in his rear end and is forced to sing the national <UNK> at <UNK> all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife while we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come <UNK> we are simultaneously left appalled and <UNK> by the nature of his punishment indeed such stark <UNK> could act as a summary of the whole film every moment of light <UNK> is counter balanced with a moment of <UNK> every shred of hope is <UNK> with a sense of despair for every character you could like or feel sympathy for there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate we might want to turn away from <UNK> to dismiss it as an exercise in misery but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be <UNK>
<START> this incredibly overrated anime television series 26 episodes 25 minutes each is about a 14 year old boy and two of his girl classmates who pilots a giant robot to defend japan against <UNK> beings called angels there is very little explanation given to the angels or why their numbers have <UNK> in recent times and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason why not attack all at once instead of at <UNK> out <UNK> that are convenient for the humans you're attempting to destroy the robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occurs br br some might be intrigued by fans who mention the very few symbolic references <UNK> but that's all they are shallow one liners to religious or philosophical concepts that are randomly tossed in with zero <UNK> as a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the <UNK> of the characters who are really nothing more than self <UNK> <UNK> the psychology is pathetic with hopelessly simplistic conflicts like i hate my father repeated over and over and over and over again with no progression beyond their face value it's no understatement to say that these characters <UNK> this series from time wasting mediocrity to anger inducing garbage during the final episodes with their endless angst ridden <UNK> of <UNK> repetitive <UNK> some of which is totally meaningless br br i'm not kidding when i say that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed every day i'd look at the dvd set sitting on my living room table and say to myself damn i've gotta watch the next episode at some point sigh i may as well slug through another one tonight the real <UNK> was that the episodes were only 25 minutes long yet they were somehow able to <UNK> into a completely uninteresting <UNK> within the opening 10 minutes this is coming from a guy who will happily sit through 150 minute films with <UNK> pacing so my criticism of this series is most <UNK> indeed br br never in my entire life have i <UNK> watching a series as much as <UNK> i had already purchased it based off of all the <UNK> comments on imdb and i certainly wasn't going to let it collect dust after spending my hard earned money what followed was 10 hours of pure <UNK> torture my love hate relationship with anime is turning into a hate love relationship after this highly acclaimed disaster br br <UNK> represents everything anime should not be massive <UNK> of dull pretentious tripe under the <UNK> of intelligent cinema the universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable and the ridiculous <UNK> by fans that this series as one of <UNK> greatest achievements is probably the most <UNK> comment i've ever heard on imdb and i've seen some <UNK>
<START> kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals a journey on the darkest road ever the road of no return the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california the man david duchovny in his best role up to now wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl who is a photographer is going to take the pictures so they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what <UNK> them on the way to share the journey <UNK> they decide to find another couple and they put an ad but the couple that answers it is not just any couple it is one of the strangest couples ever the girl is a naive <UNK> creature that dreams a lot and loves <UNK> the man is exactly the opposite a cruel ruthless murderer we learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to kalifornia not with c as usual but with k presumably <UNK> the word killer along his journey of betrayal murder and finally defeat all the leads duchovny pitt lewis and forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star the photography is amazing with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie and the music suits the dark character of the film on the whole this is a really good movie don't miss it you'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with
<START> the <UNK> parts one and two was the only 2 <UNK> during the 3 year run of the original trek series and it was because <UNK> was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot the cage the move was made out of necessity to combat <UNK> problems in getting episodes produced such a sf show back in the 1960s was a <UNK> to get done on time one positive outcome back then was that audiences unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic <UNK> a dozen years of <UNK> history though they still used terms such as <UNK> space <UNK> in these early episodes br br the <UNK> story begins as a space mystery plot the enterprise is <UNK> to <UNK> 11 for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these <UNK> astonishingly though even mccoy <UNK> the fact that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes <UNK> on his part impossible it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some <UNK> scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain <UNK> now horribly crippled well spock is half human we tend to forget or has he simply gone mad it may very well be for he's directing enterprise to <UNK> iv a planet so off limits it's the subject of the only known death penalty on <UNK> books when the <UNK> is up there's a great scene of spock <UNK> to a <UNK> mccoy as <UNK> looks on in shock even kirk usually steady as a captain should be doesn't know what to make of his first <UNK> illogical conduct br br in the 3rd and final acts we begin to see <UNK> images of a mission of the enterprise from 13 years prior when capt <UNK> was commanding and spock was one of his officers we really don't know where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish and that's another thing that makes this a very good 2 <UNK> we really need to find out what it's all about in the 2nd part not only is spock facing severe <UNK> but it looks like <UNK> career may be finished as well double <UNK> folks this is also the 1st <UNK> episode to feature one of those <UNK> none were available in the earlier the enemy within when the <UNK> were really needed there's also one of those neat <UNK> paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic <UNK> this was the only way to <UNK> such things back then finally check out <UNK> smug approach at the start of the episode boy do things go <UNK> on him as the story progresses
<START> all the world's a stage and its people actors in it or something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit or even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story itself br br this film was a grand experiment that said hey the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the story br br alas no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said
<START> another american pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all it doesn't deserve the name american pie they should have stopped at the wedding br br this movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title american pie on when i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series it doesn't fell like american pie at all it has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other american pie movies br br i don't recommend it ever actually i don't recommend any of the american pie presents movies just stick with the nice original trilogy br br 2 10
<START> warning spoilers ahead br br spoilers br br i've seen movie in german so it might be that i missed some clues br br despite some weakness in the plot it's a movie that came through to me i liked especially <UNK> <UNK> acting sometimes i got impression that she is <UNK> but i can't stop wondering what happened at the end with bob cassie and baby i <UNK> she after initially being set on bob eventually ended up loving him and <UNK> what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him otherwise it's a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it it's up to viewer to decide and i don't like such endings dean cain was as good as ever eric roberts well i've seen him better but also worse br br i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and <UNK> in unexpected situations than a crime story br br bottom line is i liked it very much
<START> the secretary is one of those cheesy cliched thrillers that one is subjected to watching on a sunday afternoon when there is virtually nothing else on while the plot a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them may be one of a kind i recognized countless plot twists probably taken from other tv movies that i had been subjected to for the very same reason br br to make matters worse i was not wild about the cast mel harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many tv movies as either a mom or some sort of victim of foul play or abuse that one must wonder the kind of life she leads in this one she gets the joy of playing a mom and a victim of psycho secretary sheila kelly who was not a very good choice as the villain while sheila kelly has made some good career moves <UNK> breaking in and i guess law and order she is also <UNK> by a string of pitiful tv movie roles and this one just adds to it as for the others i don't have any clear memories of them so that must say something br br this one will play on the lifetime network i think that's where i saw it but don't bother watching it unless you are too bored for words not that it will make you any more <UNK>
<START> i have just started watching the tv series what i like about you and i must say that is a joy to watch i always like to see new shows do well considering a lot of shows go off before you really get a feel for them i have watched amanda <UNK> since all that she is truly a funny girl what is the best about her comedy is that its so natural and what i mean about that is its something that a person could here there best friend saying its not <UNK> br br i just recently started watching the show and have fell in love i am just watching re runs as of now but am looking forward to the next season all the characters in the show give something to the whole story line its nice to see some old face from other shows i enjoyed watching in the past such as <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> leslie <UNK> from popular and wesley jonathan from city guys the new character are very talented as well nick <UNK> has that charm the makes you love him even when he is doing something wrong to holly <UNK> br br overall this show has the right ingredients to be successful i look forward to watching it grow
<START> it's been so long since i've seen this movie at least 15 years and yet it still <UNK> me with a vivid image of the horrific consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the <UNK> convention br br a unit of australian underwater <UNK> experts are captured in an <UNK> near japan following a successful mission to set mines in a japanese harbor br br once in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other <UNK> but to their <UNK> soon learn from a friendly japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies since they were out of uniform when captured the consequences of such an <UNK> by japanese martial code is execution by <UNK> br br despite their <UNK> and the <UNK> of the sympathetic prison guard the day of <UNK> approaches like a <UNK> time bomb the tension is so high you will actually hear the <UNK> though it may just be your chest <UNK> with the <UNK> of a <UNK> execution squad br br the ending is actually too painful to <UNK> in my head much less write it here but i can promise you you'll never forget it good luck finding the video in the u s
<START> just two comments seven years apart hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling power as has been mentioned the low budget <UNK> status of 13 <UNK> row is a <UNK> factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se br br true the plot at its most basic is a re working of the <UNK> horror only without much horror more a case of intrigue <UNK> might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played <UNK> investigating a couple of seemingly <UNK> murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments br br having picked the dvd up for a mere 3 95 last week at my regular video store i cannot <UNK> the <UNK> 10 95 would be an acceptable price for the film just don't expect fireworks
<START> one can deal with historical inaccuracies but this film was just too much practically nothing was even close to truth and even for the era it was seen as silly br br in defense of ford it was revealed on an old talk show that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real <UNK> <UNK> who was obviously old <UNK> and <UNK> the scene his own way <UNK> told the director about the <UNK> and how it was planned to happen during the <UNK> arrival so despite what other historians claim <UNK> himself <UNK> that it was <UNK> br br this movie portrays <UNK> as an honest man and also his brothers history doesn't exactly say they were or weren't most people like to <UNK> a bit of <UNK> and <UNK> into their characters but that is nothing new the truth is probably closer to them being the law <UNK> sorts of <UNK> at the ok <UNK> men who saw it as a career and believe me in the old west you didn't have time to think about too much else br br characters that don't exist characters depicted dying at the <UNK> who really didn't all make this a weaker film it is further <UNK> by mature who really didn't make a convincing doc he may be the worst cast choice ever for doc but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth after all ford did get information first hand from <UNK> <UNK> br br it is also <UNK> by the all so predictable events involving the mexican girl hollywood was very pro nazi in those days and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their <UNK> to hitler <UNK> this occurs in most movies until the eighties it is no excuse and does <UNK> the art however br br the actors who play the <UNK> do well and brennan is always a thrill in fact mature may be the only acting downside of this flick still it is the weakest of the old ok <UNK> movies
<START> i watched <UNK> beach on cable for a while and i sort of enjoyed it the fat guy is the best character as he seems to be a nice guy the rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men i like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and <UNK> <UNK> beach is also funny because the low budget babes in this movie are strictly home girls most low budget movies have that local babe quality and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local <UNK> and underwear models for <UNK> <UNK> some of them had so much <UNK> hanging from their <UNK> that it was funny to watch how the youngsters went wild over what was essentially some really over used high <UNK> <UNK> there were some <UNK> too that is the charm of these low budget crappy movies you will see a lot of <UNK> and some real <UNK> i checked up on some of them at imdb and seven years later <UNK> beach is their only credit too bad it would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a where are they now book on all of the <UNK> that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return what happened there are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on tv you wonder what ever happened to x anyhow this movie mostly blows but it has some funny moments
<START> without peter ustinov and maggie smith this could easily have been a turkey but they are brilliant ustinov is at his best and for fans of maggie it is great to see her in her early days matching ustinov every step of the way for with and timing for <UNK> in their fifties and i am in that <UNK> it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the swinging sixties and although this film spends a lot of time in <UNK> it has plenty of sixties nostalgia including red <UNK> <UNK> street a song by <UNK> and a delicious shot up the <UNK> <UNK> of a waitress the like of which england has never seen since in public places as an i t engineer i know that the computer <UNK> tricks are laughable but they are not meant to be taken seriously nor are the wonderful stereotypes of italians french and germans
<START> a fine effort for an australian show which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a <UNK> in quality aussie drama dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way no but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us the cast is great <UNK> works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen the british cast is strong also especially the <UNK> and <UNK> characters but <UNK> forsythe may be the saving light not that it needs saving if this show is to get another season i wasn't a fan of his performance in the <UNK> awesome <UNK> time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always <UNK> its also good to see brooke <UNK> again lets hope the show keeps <UNK> with each episode
<START> i think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like my girl my girl was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters <UNK> culkin as thomas j dies the story was over after the first movie i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on that was senseless
<START> eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand up concert film i have ever seen most stand up acts usually have <UNK> at some point but not this one folks for 90 min there is not one moment that is not side <UNK> funny from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead on impression of mr t the laughs are non stop br br sadly this was done in 1983 and eddie hasn't done anything nearly as funny it's unbelievable that the man who wrote this <UNK> brilliant show wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all br br eddie if you're out there please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious believe me your fans will love you for it and i think you know that
<START> weak fast and <UNK> this is the <UNK> movie in fact you can see always this brand of oil in a lot of scene the real protagonist are the cars weak performances of cage and duvall a <UNK> angelina jolie is a unlikely mechanic for the lovers of dream car <UNK> and <UNK> over all
<START> david arquette is a young and naive home security alarm br br salesman taken under the wing of stanley <UNK> arquette is a br br golden boy <UNK> a big sale on his first call to widow kate br br <UNK> and her dopey son ryan reynolds things are going br br well for arquette he is appearing in commercials for the security br br firm and he is falling in love with <UNK> br br then <UNK> and his right hand woman mary <UNK> let him in br br on a little secret they sometimes break into the houses of their br br <UNK> in order to scare them and to get their neighbors to buy br br security systems from the firm arquette decides not to get br br involved taking <UNK> to meet his family and going through life br br with a goofy smile on his face then someone breaks into br br <UNK> home and murders her and her son arquette suspects <UNK> and sets a series of traps resulting in a gun to his br br <UNK> head as <UNK> <UNK> his innocence br br based on a stage play the <UNK> is not opened up well the br br scenes where arquette takes the <UNK> to meet his parents br br are badly played and completely unfunny they are also out of line br br with the character <UNK> is playing as she gets drunk and tells br br sexually explicit stories to <UNK> mom michael learned other br br than these scenes <UNK> is not given much to do but she br br does a lot with the little she is given br br stanley <UNK> looking just like terry <UNK> is a riot as the br br security firm owner he is a creep who really does not understand br br <UNK> moral <UNK> however when he turns into a br br <UNK> <UNK> after arquette kidnaps him he is hilarious mary br br <UNK> seems to have been <UNK> for a bigger role but br br she mostly stands around and agrees with <UNK> ryan reynolds br br is too old to play a dumb teenager but he is funny especially br br telling his own explicit sexual story to arquette br br the screenplay <UNK> from romantic comedy to dark comedy too br br soon <UNK> meeting the parents is completely <UNK> br br except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can br br break into her house <UNK> and reynolds are in the film just br br to give arquette a reason to take revenge on <UNK> br br arquette who has <UNK> he is a good actor is awful here he br br relies on the <UNK> <UNK> that got him through those br br at t ads and he is not a strong enough presence to build this br br weak film around actually reynolds might have been a better br br choice in the role br br <UNK> direction is good nothing that will win an oscar soon br br <UNK> <UNK> light <UNK> score recalls the type of film noir this br br film tries to be and it is really catchy on top of that br br despite the <UNK> <UNK> failure as a lead and the <UNK> br br <UNK> quality sinks the film i do not recommend it br br this is rated r for physical violence gun violence some gore br br strong profanity brief female nudity sexual content strong sexual br br references and adult situations
<START> writer director john hughes covered all <UNK> as usual with this bitter sweet sunday afternoon family movie curly sue is a sweet <UNK> orphan cared for from <UNK> by bill the pair live off their wits as they travel the great us of a fate matches them with a very pretty <UNK> lawyer and the rest is predictable br br kids will love this film as they can relate to the heroine played by 9 year old <UNK> <UNK> who went on to be the you go girl of <UNK> commercials the character is supposed to be about 6 or 7 as she is <UNK> to think about going to school some of her <UNK> suggests that she is every day of 9 or older br br similar to home alone there is plenty of slap stick and little <UNK> <UNK> big fat <UNK> again this is formula film making aimed at a young audience entertaining and heartwarming don't look for any surprises but be prepared to shed a tear or two
<START> i am 17 and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes i love the 1990s movies and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo <UNK> of this decade scooby doo and the <UNK> king which i wasn't expecting to be as good as it was anyway back to get a clue i watched some episodes expecting something very good but from what i saw of it i wasn't impressed at all first of all i hated the animation it was flat <UNK> and very saturday morning cartoon standard easily the worst aspect of the series even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation even worse shaggy and scooby looked like aliens and i really missed fred <UNK> and daphne as they added a lot to the old episodes when scooby doo was positively good i also hated the character changes because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero something they would've never had done in the movies or in the scooby doo where are you show the theme tune wasn't very good either i can't even remember it and the jokes were lame and contrived though i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast had they had better material and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as <UNK> possible which they did might i add in conclusion i personally thought it was awful and i am not trying to <UNK> it it's what i personally feel 1 10 <UNK> cox
<START> i know it's a power rangers gimmick and <UNK> to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie if they are going to write a plot with <UNK> at least have the decency to make it silly it's kind of hilarious if you watch this we have a typical family filled with cliched characters father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself <UNK> air head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space funny stuff br br however the real great moment comes near the end when war dad and bad acting villain try to work a sword fight but then they realize none of them know how to probably because no room in budget for <UNK> so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in lol br br 1 10 rating because they try to treat this seriously
<START> what did producer director stanley kramer see in adam <UNK> novel and <UNK> very puzzling screenplay were there a few pieces left out on purpose and what about gene hackman richard widmark edward albert eli <UNK> and mickey rooney what did they see in this very muddled story br br and why did <UNK> <UNK> who gave a horrible performance accept such a <UNK> role br br the domino principle wants to be on the same <UNK> as the <UNK> view or the <UNK> candidate and misses the mark by a very wide <UNK> a major misfire by stanley kramer
<START> if you liked roman <UNK> <UNK> you should probably check out the tenant since it's a similar concept just with polanski stepping in and playing the <UNK> <UNK> this is actually one of my favorites of his movies second after rosemary's baby of course and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim the other residents of the building are all <UNK> and <UNK> on keeping the noise level down even the slightest <UNK> becomes a big deal and polanski who stars becomes increasingly paranoid and <UNK> to his loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on it gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize it's only a matter of time before he decides <UNK> re <UNK> her fatal leap out the window the film is a bit slow and <UNK> for a while but if you have ever seen a roman polanski movie you should know it's going to end with a bang and this flick doesn't disappoint it's also best if you don't question the <UNK> of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness because it's pretty <UNK> surreal at times polanski is very good as the <UNK> deranged resident who somehow <UNK> the ever <UNK> isabelle <UNK> we also get to see him running around in drag which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time damn he makes for one ugly chick so polanski fans who can actually look past his thirty year old <UNK> charges should enjoy the tenant as an entertaining psychological head trip
<START> there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are <UNK> to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is <UNK> your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers <UNK> in their <UNK> and one of the soldiers <UNK> to drink <UNK> these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven seagal br br take my advice stay away from this piece of crap
<START> what would you do is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional <UNK> palace you will also be left wondering if alice danes was telling the truth or not a issue that is left <UNK> and rightly so this is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film although it is slow at times its pace is <UNK> of the story line but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next the ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters which are brilliantly played by kate beckinsale and claire danes bill <UNK> performance is commendable too
<START> i was pleasantly surprised by the film let's face it the premise doesn't sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the <UNK> flick but it had an <UNK> nature that wins one over there were no moments that i found <UNK> and i doubt any that i'll remember the next day but this doesn't fail as a nice <UNK> what i found funny was watching it here in <UNK> with my chinese girlfriend who never understands anything i like i told her there was a plot three guys have to bring back some <UNK> to london hardly satisfying for her there is no <UNK> going on here for the camera which i'd been expecting after reading a number of the comments i do take exception however to comparisons with <UNK> and i not in the same league and i doubt was it intended to www <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> when this first came out my dad brought it home we were amazed by it it was so different from anything we had seen before i was looking for a specific movie last night and i found the <UNK> eye again the box is falling apart and i am surprised that the tape still works although it is not <UNK> <UNK> quality graphics it is still very good they should sell this again it is a landmark for computer animation imagery highly recommended br br this is what it is br br the <UNK> eye is a spectacular odyssey through time your journey begins at the dawn of creation and moves through the rise of man and technology travel in the world of <UNK> and on into the future with breathtaking computer animation imagery br br the <UNK> eye joins the <UNK> of over 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists with a powerful original music soundtrack this unique collaboration takes you on an incredible voyage into the <UNK> eye
<START> the most embarrassing moment in this film is when brady <UNK> says <UNK> <UNK> near the end the film i practically died i'm still not really sure why the screenwriters put that line in there was it supposed to create romance because it nearly made me sick br br the rest of the script was almost as bad br br i've never liked the original thunderbirds but a thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much this movie doesn't if it didn't have the big draw card of the thunderbirds brand it would have been <UNK> straight to tv or <UNK> in the post production maybe even before br br like i said the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play <UNK> song <UNK> are <UNK> i can't believe i wasted 7 watching this through pay per view
<START> this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a <UNK> scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture <UNK> to be artistic but fails to pay <UNK> to the <UNK> of story telling br br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story there isn't one
<START> baby face is one of the better of the forgotten films before the code it was shown last night after the 1931 version of <UNK> bridge on the turner classic network so i was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored br br stanwyck is living in east st louis where she may have known the drunken parents of myra mae clarke in <UNK> bridge her father is robert <UNK> she has lived with him since the death of her mother and in the restored dialog he has been <UNK> her since she was 14 years old now she is resident waitress and part time whore in his <UNK> her closest friend being <UNK> <UNK> harris the african american servant who <UNK> keeps bullying it is one of the two good points of <UNK> personality that she keeps standing up to her father about harris threatening to leave if harris is fired and since it is the <UNK> workers like <UNK> <UNK> who enjoy seeing stanwyck serve them rather than the flavor of the <UNK> he serves that brings them in <UNK> has to <UNK> her br br the one guy who comes to the <UNK> regularly whom stanwyck likes is the <UNK> and intellectual <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she will just leave her <UNK> home he is also pushing the philosophy of <UNK> <UNK> and the idea of the will to power more about this later br br after she knocks out the local political <UNK> arthur <UNK> and has an argument with <UNK> about this a still explosion kills <UNK> and <UNK> stanwyck to leave her home town she and harris head to new york city managing to get free transport by a <UNK> <UNK> car by sleeping with a <UNK> james murray they reach new york and after walking about they see the <UNK> trust company established <UNK> and the friendly guard tells her where the <UNK> office is br br we slowly watch stanwyck <UNK> the corporate ladder to the top similar but <UNK> than robert morse <UNK> in how to succeed in business without really trying but morse was a man in a man dominated company stanwyck knows her sexual <UNK> is her weapon she goes through john wayne douglas <UNK> a section of the film that i always felt was the most shocking curiously enough when i watched it douglas wood henry <UNK> and finally george brent each ends up falling for her and either being pushed aside when no longer useful or destroyed by her brent the new president of the bank his grandfather <UNK> eventually marries her and the crisis of the film is when the <UNK> economic situation is <UNK> especially after brent buys her a fortune in <UNK> and gives her valuable bonds brent is <UNK> will she stick up for him br br spoiler coming up br br the one thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still <UNK> endings the original ending had stanwyck <UNK> a ship for europe <UNK> brent to his fate but realizing she can't do it to him returning to their apartment house and finding he's shot himself she is riding with him to the hospital as it ends now before the <UNK> footage was found the film ended with them apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it and <UNK> back to east st louis to live happily if poor br br neither of these are good endings stanwyck should continue on her destructive course with brent the last of her victims but even without the <UNK> office the script writers one is <UNK> <UNK> by the way saw fit to have her find a moral center she has none at least none for powerful men whom she hates i don't think that a depression audience would have <UNK> that type of conclusion br br there are other problems due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society it was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933 so stanwyck has her work cut out for her wood when she is going to be fired for an <UNK> with him admits that he did not want her to work br br but in 2006 stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place in the film there are nasty <UNK> remarks obviously some based on jealousy towards stanwyck from other <UNK> and female employees at her rapid rise in 2006 she'd be frequently confronting women superiors and she would find them cutting her off at the legs very quickly of course if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is <UNK> and she also never seems to meet any men who are gay they do have gay male executives in business who wouldn't give a damn about her legs or breasts br br then there is her mentor mr <UNK> <UNK> is remade in the <UNK> version into trying to make her seek a moral center in reality he pushes <UNK> but the way in a <UNK> sense the nazis pushed <UNK> find your way to power and push it while <UNK> did stress power sometimes it wasn't the be all and end all of his theories otherwise nobody would read him today in college <UNK> <UNK> is obviously self educated but only half educated in short if somebody who thoroughly studied <UNK> confronted <UNK> he'd make him look like a half educated fool and this is <UNK> mentor a good film and for it's day worth a 10 but seriously flawed
<START> this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be there were a couple of sub plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end but they didn't if you want a alien in the frozen waste story stick with the 1950's version of the thing not the abomination that was remade in gore o vision 20 years later br br i couldn't get over the fact that the alien looked pretty much recycled from independence day br br the bare minimum sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended mood br br lots of scenery chewing with little payoff
<START> a gave it a 2 instead of a 1 awful because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork but that wasn't enough to save it br br the <UNK> toned washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies nothing new there i can see there were some hat <UNK> to other old classic movies ok no problem with that br br but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting not something that would put you to sleep br br the story line and the script of this movie was awful the characters two dimensional slow moving some of the scenes were pretty to look at but ultimately as a whole it was quite boring i couldn't recommend it
<START> you could say that the actors will make a movie but this clearly proves that statement wrong most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to they play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways the story is very simple it could be summed up in a few words but i'll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film br br i had to fast forward the parts where jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater i'd have to say that 70 of this film <UNK> around cooking eating or getting ready to eat quite frankly i'd rather not spend my time watching jack chew <UNK> with an open mouth personally i could have done without the <UNK> references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too br br outside of my own personal <UNK> the film really lacked anything worth it's time there were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging when something happens the reactions of the characters are vague and dry br br best not to look this one up
<START> this movie was horrible i watched it three times and not even the whole thing it's just impossible to watch the story line sucks it's depressing and utterly disgusting i don't write spoilers for anything so if you want to know why it's so disgusting see it for yourself the only good thing about this movie was john savage his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts in the movie the little kid in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is <UNK> i saw this movie at movie stores around america so i assumed it would be a good movie jesus christ was i wrong the acting is all horrible and the nudity itself is lame and nasty another thing is <UNK> <UNK> the other main character hasn't been in such bad movies in the past in fact she was in some pretty good ones same with john savage this movie sucks
<START> unfortunately for me the first busby berkeley movie i ever watched was <UNK> street i then expected all of his stuff to be that good i found out that wasn't necessarily the case even here with my all time favorite classic era actor james cagney br br oh the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as always but the story is like many of the others and quite tiresome they seem to always involve screaming unhappy show producers in this film it's cagney who winds up shouting things out so often that he gives me a headache after awhile and his character wears thin fast br br even the songs in here are anywhere near <UNK> street class songs you could hum for years and years decades i should say the songs in this movie are not memorable no this is one of the few early cagney films and berkeley films i totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching
<START> being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co stars in maureen o'hara what an exquisite beauty and anthony quinn i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure br br hollywood at its best
<START> wes craven you are having a laugh at our expense the red eye plot is preposterous we are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent 8 weeks watching a girl who then turns up at an airport behind her <UNK> and <UNK> her up successfully somehow <UNK> a seat next to her in a two seat space not trapped in the middle of a five seat row contacts at check in and is <UNK> nice during a painfully <UNK> build up then once up in the air in a confined space surrounded by strangers he immediately starts threatening the vacuous if super efficient rachel mcadams and saying <UNK> like <UNK> got ya daddy do what i say or <UNK> gets <UNK> well forgive me but didn't they already have her daddy ready for slaughter so you better <UNK> long before she stepped on the plane and therefore wouldn't it have been oh <UNK> much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and <UNK> her in a room somewhere forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important <UNK> required or even <UNK> this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists keep the dumb dad in distress thing intact if you must but dress it up better so that holding him in <UNK> way until the convoluted plot had been <UNK> made some sense without the plane <UNK> <UNK> without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terrorist assassin couldn't the massive <UNK> missile <UNK> employed have been far more easily used on say a car driving down the highway with the politician inside rather than the <UNK> story of a miami <UNK> hotel from a fishing boat mind you as we already know security in miami is <UNK> so they'll speed away i know i know far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for 8 weeks <UNK> her <UNK> house to steal his <UNK> that somehow star trek style gets transported from miami to texas instantly in order to perhaps get her to <UNK> for a politician to change hotel room and and and well a thousand things could go wrong here each one entirely destroying the big plan so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful such as 1 <UNK> 2 car 3 boom my 50 minute drive home from the cinema was spent <UNK> the abundance of flaws and stupid <UNK> <UNK> twists which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience and as for security back at miami airport we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane chased by cops who during the chase sits down to have a coffee moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar then runs again like crazy up and down the whole <UNK> by now also chased by crazed cillian murphy no <UNK> then i had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for 10 seconds at miami airport a couple of years back so instead of speaking to the cops her allies or getting on the <UNK> at a call box direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger mcadams prefers instead to steal a people <UNK> off a family in the airport <UNK> call the damned security and drives home to daddy <UNK> down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house in a rich <UNK> watch district <UNK> the front <UNK> in the process an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon <UNK> after about a minute yet which somehow fails to register with <UNK> who aren't even mildly curious thus <UNK> 15 more minutes of hide and seek <UNK> as the duo run around the vast <UNK> type house <UNK> it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all cillian surely <UNK> silly <UNK> for doing this one <UNK> turns from ice assassin to <UNK> unhinged and inept lunatic killer at the end this <UNK> ruthless <UNK> of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her <UNK> <UNK> i'd better stop because the stream of drivel i'm writing here must sound as <UNK> as the red eye script if ms mcadams hadn't been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> eye <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i saw this film on the history channel today in 2006 first of all i realize that this is not a documentary that it is a drama but one might hope that at least the critical facts that the story turns on might be based on actual events reagan was shot and the other characters were real people the movie got that right from there on <UNK> on facts rapidly <UNK> i had never heard of this movie before seeing it having been a tv reporter at the time of these events i was stunned that i had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of secretary <UNK> as portrayed by richard dreyfuss the whole nation had heard the i am in control etc but <UNK> <UNK> is bullying a <UNK> <UNK> and totally out of control personally having watched the film i began <UNK> the subject on the internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and <UNK> of most of the situation room conversations that this film pretends to <UNK> incredibly many the the principal facts of the film meant to show a white house secret service etc in total chaos and the <UNK> <UNK> behaving <UNK> and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war are <UNK> incorrect they didn't happen there is internal conflict to be sure <UNK> makes <UNK> his press room performance is historically <UNK> and he is difficult but there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film there are too many gross errors to list but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish <UNK> inform entertain i believe they failed on all three <UNK> it is difficult to <UNK> motives to others but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention and as for my beloved history <UNK> reel to real follow on documentary there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film namely the events within the administration on the day of the shooting so the viewer was left to research those without much if any help from the network
<START> i always thought this would be a long and boring talking heads flick full of static interior takes dude i was wrong election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller drama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of <UNK> <UNK> characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an <UNK> it's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters furthermore <UNK> to succeeds in creating some truly <UNK> images due to <UNK> composed lighting and atmospheric light shadow <UNK> although there's hardly any action the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality cool movie that deserves more attention and i came to like the <UNK> <UNK> guitar score quite a bit
<START> the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horror cult cinema and every new movie he releases  which is about two three per year  immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism you're actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype you know like it's popular to hate uwe boll whether you liked his movies or not let me just assure you that this is not the case uwe boll is a terrible writer director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film making industry seed is another most unfortunate of proof that in here boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he <UNK> numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist like a plot a narrative structure character development tension <UNK> seed is a hideous movie full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage i once read that seed was uwe <UNK> interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of torture porn flicks but that's not even close the film <UNK> does borrow some influences from saw and hostel but basically it's just another <UNK> dull slasher with an <UNK> killer and video game violence br br the first 45 minutes of seed are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen for you see boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a hyper fast <UNK> text explaining there's a federal us law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to <UNK> them fail so you know this will happen later on but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered <UNK> victims <UNK> much who wears a bag over his head he watches real life animal cruelty footage and thus we watch real life animal cruelty footage thanks for that mr boll and <UNK> people as the slowly <UNK> in their <UNK> including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted when he's finally captured during the most amateurish and implausible police <UNK> ever filmed and put on death row the film even becomes more retarded after being buried alive because the electric chair couldn't <UNK> him max seed <UNK> back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him br br the senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad they're downright <UNK> and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic multiple twists and sub plot in seed are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable <UNK> human mind because they're just too dumb nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same <UNK> place where they first caught him seed is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes personally i refuse to accept that the cast crew members didn't notice this as well it really makes you think that uwe boll simply <UNK> all advice and criticism and just <UNK> shoots his movies the way he wants to i imagine his yelling stuff like shut up and do as you are told to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they're shooting doesn't make a <UNK> of sense br br just for the fun of <UNK> people there's a <UNK> overlong sequence where max seed <UNK> an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she's tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room instead of shocking as boll intended it to be this sequence masterfully <UNK> how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is seed is horrendous it's disgusting it's <UNK> it's  boll
<START> first of all jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie and she's just awful this movie has every horror move cliché in imagination and all badly played the over <UNK> teen couple the comical not horny jock the <UNK> cool chick the creepy local color guy the <UNK> type couple the <UNK> chick who amazingly never dies in these films the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a <UNK> pool it's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse sure the funniest thing in here is the <UNK> trying to eat <UNK> <UNK> but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog avoid at all costs
<START> a pot <UNK> if ever i saw one a supposed thriller <UNK> from a time to kill silence of the <UNK> even an <UNK> in the heat of the night with a little reverse murder a la strangers on a train thrown in it fails <UNK> where all the above to a large degree succeeded namely in delivering thrills the plot seems <UNK> from a bigger book making the plot developments obvious and <UNK> while the direction lacks pace and <UNK> to <UNK> in any kudos a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails <UNK> too connery is clearly <UNK> down in his old age barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh darn kids of his he even has a father in law who seems younger than him laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you're confused from the outset as to whether he's a bad guy or a good guy someone once said that flashbacks shouldn't lie they do <UNK> here the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their <UNK> stereotyped roles the supposed climax managed too to roll by leaving me firmly <UNK> in the back not as should have been the aim front edge of my seat mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure
<START> of all the movies i've seen this one rates almost at the bottom haunted mansion nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom it is <UNK> the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously <UNK> and illogical oprah gives a <UNK> appearance as <UNK> mom but is not nearly at her potential other famous performers also seem to be at their worst the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a <UNK> in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes <UNK> one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk now the family he's working for are not against blacks but he thinks they are so when he comes home he puts her to bed but she begins <UNK> the blind mother yes hears this so bigger tries to silence her but instead <UNK> her now <UNK> he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do he <UNK> her into the coal <UNK> so <UNK> are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the <UNK> the idiot didn't have the <UNK> to get rid of the <UNK> he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom if your desperate for a bad movie this one could do the job but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in <UNK> 40's and 50's or see a good drama there are a lot better <UNK> avoid this
<START> the only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline otherwise this movie was terrible the acting was ridiculously bad and the set design was cheesy and very tacky the story was decent but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting i wouldn't recommend watching this one the only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractive especially ryan bauer the man who plays the soap opera star some of the editing was well done but there are continuity errors all over the place i'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad can we get a good one soon
<START> for those who commented on the <UNK> as being accurate which basically <UNK> the english it was interesting to see this film by all accounts this was the <UNK> war that americans have ever been involved in and they were the only <UNK> present it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either <UNK> or <UNK> all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts often culminating in the suffering of the innocent this was not a film where you <UNK> anybody on but both <UNK> and <UNK> all
<START> brides are dying at the <UNK> and their corpses are <UNK> no one knows why or who but an <UNK> reporter <UNK> <UNK> notes that each bride was wearing a strange <UNK> and she goes to interview its creator dr <UNK> bela lugosi now dr <UNK> is a mad scientist with some strange <UNK> including sleeping in <UNK> and <UNK> his elderly wife elizabeth russell with the fluid of young brides to keep her young br br the corpse <UNK> has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it shouldn't be able to get boring unfortunately while it starts off quite well it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clichés and predictable plot br br there are some good things about it bela lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly elizabeth russell is also a beautiful suave <UNK> and very creepy <UNK> and i'm always a fan of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is also convincing as the reporter here br br it maintains a bit of a gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent br br but overall it just didn't manage to hold my interest through the whole picture and for that i have to rate it poorly
<START> okay i seriously can't think of anything worse than the <UNK> series there are many bad things in life <UNK> <UNK> etc but seriously power rangers has got to be at the bottom of this list can you think of anything more stupid than five six teenagers who don't even act like a normal teen dancing around in identical suits with different colors so that you can tell them apart fans have you ever come across a real person who gets <UNK> against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured power rangers are for five year old boys and believe me i never liked this show even when i was five br br i guess you can say <UNK> thunder is an exception the teens actually act like teens and tommy oliver actually acts like a mentor or no a teacher it's got teen humor though the fighting is lame i don't hate <UNK> thunder br br many people say power rangers are crap but i wouldn't it would be an insult to crap so face it five year old boys power rangers is rubbish
<START> this film has scenes that come back to me at the strangest times that intense scene with mr <UNK> telling mrs <UNK> that someone he spoke with witnesses the girl being pushed out the window by a woman who fits her description is one that rolls around the way she keeps referring to him by name in a greek accent mr <UNK> and then when boyer discovers her having just taken poison and gives her one last <UNK> up the side of the head before she dies its a delight fools fools all my life etc etc you get the point i have to buy this one i love dan <UNK> acting he usually plays some <UNK> foreign <UNK> or police chief and appeared in casablanca and many great pictures
<START> bad actors terrible script totally unbelievable ending this film had it all after seeing films like this you wonder why the makers bothered at all this film has absolutely nothing to say all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films a total waste of time
<START> <UNK> <UNK> birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys but it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic <UNK> slasher film it's up to the local town sheriff dan burke bo hopkins the wild bunch and his annoying mystery loving <UNK> two shoes daughter <UNK> dana <UNK> friday the 13th part 3 to get to the bottom of these killings br br this film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to <UNK> itself from a lot of it's <UNK> slasher <UNK> it doesn't hurt that <UNK> has a great body i feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted on the downside the movie is <UNK> with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary a grating theme some that is used a bit too often and an ending that is a tad anti climatic but the good <UNK> the bad barely give this a rent but i wouldn't buy it br br eye candy <UNK> shirley shows her tits bush and ass br br my grade c br br code red dvd extras an intro by star <UNK> shirley and director of intruder scott <UNK> both director's cut theatrical version of the film audio conversation with star shirley and director jim <UNK> interview with shirley <UNK> bo hopkins still gallery theatrical trailer for this film and trailers for nightmare stunt rock <UNK> <UNK> conspiracy
<START> here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea that is the problem isn't the concept is fresh and full of potential but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions get you interested and invested in the characters this movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why first you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here it's suppose to be about normal people put in a <UNK> situation they are not believable in the way they act and interact example jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is <UNK> <UNK> and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here i mean what is that he looks like he's on the toilet or something i loved him in re animator and the way he was playing the intense neurotic <UNK> medical genius was right on the money but not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner it's not natural i'm surprised he didn't <UNK> his jaw during filming the movie is basically on life support it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come
<START> 'i don't understand none of this makes any sense ' <UNK> one <UNK> character towards the end of death smiles at murder having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie i know exactly how he feels the story by the film's director <UNK> <UNK> good old joe <UNK> using his real name for a change is a clumsy mix of the supernatural murder mystery and pretentious arty rubbish the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire <UNK> 70s garbage such as jess <UNK> more bizarre efforts but which had me struggling to remain conscious br br opening with a <UNK> mourning the death of his beautiful sister with whom he had been having an incestuous affair before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman played by <UNK> <UNK> who stars in the equally strange <UNK> laid an <UNK> is seen alive and kicking the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von <UNK> after being invited to stay and <UNK> in their home where she is tended to by creepy dr <UNK> <UNK> kinski in a throwaway role the <UNK> <UNK> begins love affairs with both mr and mrs <UNK> meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of <UNK> and lesbian <UNK> br br <UNK> far so <UNK> i thought to myself at this point <UNK> had <UNK> incest some blood and guts and gratuitous female <UNK> ingredients of a great trashy euro horror what follows however is a lame attempt by <UNK> to combine giallo style killings ghostly goings on and even elements from edgar allan <UNK> 'the black <UNK> to tell a very silly utterly <UNK> and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave br br this film seems to have quite few <UNK> here on imdb but given the choice i would much rather watch one of the director's <UNK> movies from later in his career i guess incomprehensible meandering surreal 70s gothic horror just ain't my thing 2 5 out of 10 purely for the cheesy gore and <UNK> rounded up to 3 for imdb
<START> where to begin br br 1 <UNK> son played by <UNK> <UNK> is 30 br br <UNK> been in prison for 33 years he br br a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> home br br b asked a nice <UNK> guard to mail it for him br br c they allow <UNK> visits in secret <UNK> <UNK> br br d all of the above br br e the producers were having a little too much <UNK> at br br the time they <UNK> the script br br 2 amrita <UNK> <UNK> wants <UNK> he's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and apparently he wants her who wouldn't right but when her dad gets <UNK> out and then killed i hardly think this is a <UNK> as you'd have to be brain dead and blind not to see this coming in the film he's pretty <UNK> towards this catastrophe and with the tip <UNK> of his hat leaves her behind to save his dad never mind her loss and says <UNK> if god <UNK> it we'll meet again basically meaning i'm gonna get my dad and my job done sorry for your loss <UNK> <UNK> bye <UNK> beyond even low life hollywood standards br br 3 there are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie that you can drive all the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and any extra stuff through it pass really complete and total waste of time oh there is a great dance sequence yes only one as in dance sequence regardless of quality great belly dancing but not worth watching just for this br br rent <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> will <UNK> <UNK> ever take acting lessons for better <UNK> <UNK> conflict movies in fact <UNK> <UNK> is pretty damned good 7 5 8 i'd say
<START> i'd give this a negative rating if i could i went into this movie not expecting much but i had an open mind the whole thing is stupid the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a <UNK> and a guys johnson oh how original if i were a 12 year old boy i might laugh at that i have no idea how this movie became so popular seriously the worst thing i've ever seen i wasn't entertained it wasn't funny i wasn't even bored i wasn't anything it wasn't even so bad it was good it's just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie don't even rent this movie no clue how it's getting such a high rating
<START> you get 5 writers together have each write a different story with a different genre and then you try to make one movie out of it it's action it's adventure it's sci fi it's western it's a mess sorry but this movie absolutely stinks 4 5 is giving it an <UNK> high rating that said it's movies like this that make me think i could write movies and i can barely write
<START> it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy it is not only <UNK> preachy but absurd <UNK> dramatically straight <UNK> and painfully overwrought watching it one feels like an 8 year old child being <UNK> by having to write i will not become a fascist on the <UNK> 100 times br br now i understand that it was made during the height of ww2 and was intended to be a brave <UNK> of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about which anyone would whole <UNK> applaud and i'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day but it is presented in such an immature over obvious <UNK> way it fails <UNK> as a work of art br br the only good performances here are from paul lukas who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti fascist and <UNK> watson as the <UNK> ill mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become though their <UNK> upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of <UNK> the children are ridiculously shown as <UNK> well <UNK> little <UNK> they do not even remotely resemble real human beings and bette davis a great actress here is so one <UNK> noble i <UNK> every time she was on screen her every word her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for that she must've been <UNK> to receive a painful electric shock if she <UNK> allowed any hint of doubt or <UNK> to surface in her portrayal br br so yes this is a very important film just not a very good one
<START> my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again this movie for some reason strikes a <UNK> in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me <UNK> i watch it over and over again and love the music
<START> <UNK> <UNK> groundbreaking musical if you want to see where songs first drove a story this is the place this is the story of a starving young artist who finds he's won the <UNK> just as his <UNK> come calling unfortunately his ticket is in his coat which is in his girlfriends apartment and has been given to an on the run convict who then oh but that would be telling br br this is a light and <UNK> story where much of the dialog is sung most people think this didn't happen until <UNK> or andrew lloyd <UNK> its the sort of movie that they don't make any more and rarely did when they did its sound a film from the early days that plays like a movie from five or six years later <UNK> moves his camera around in ways that not even busby berkeley was doing though to be honest comparing the two film makers is unfair since berkeley was doing essentially stage bound dance numbers and <UNK> was moving the camera through the real world its an amazing little movie and its a charming movie that will just make you smile its just a <UNK> piece of enjoyment br br i'm sorry i can't say more its just a nice little movie and thats really all you need to know
<START> in september 2003 <UNK> year old <UNK> kennedy died he had a terrible genetic condition called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch leaving his body covered in <UNK> <UNK> and leading to a final fight against skin cancer in his last months <UNK> decided to work with filmmaker patrick <UNK> to document his life and death and the result was a film first broadcast in march that was an uplifting <UNK> and <UNK> humorous story of a <UNK> man not <UNK> away from the grim reality of <UNK> the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full produced and directed by patrick <UNK> and first shown in march 2004 the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public <UNK> over half a million pounds to <UNK> charity debra a <UNK> kennedy <UNK> <UNK> has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of <UNK> that <UNK> kennedy left a one million pound legacy

<START> throughout this film you might think this film is just for kids well it is mainly pointed towards them but it's also well rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience this time around the muppet gang try to get on broadway with the dire <UNK> keeping them from getting it produced leading them to splitting up but <UNK> won't stop and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into <UNK> br br it's a send up in part of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical only here there's the usual lot of <UNK> and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments lou <UNK> <UNK> fish <UNK> water stunt display the <UNK> campaign among many others but also with a lot of heart too the muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions on the contrary they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a <UNK> put on a <UNK> story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream br br while not as totally original in scope as the muppet movie it's got many catchy and memorable songs excellent locations all over manhattan and even some <UNK> of inter species dating and marriage cameos include <UNK> <UNK> a frog elliot <UNK> as the cop brooke <UNK> <UNK> by a rat edward i <UNK> gregory hines and joan rivers so get ready to sing along or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic yes romantic times with one of the best muppet movies
<START> the straight story is a <UNK> exploration of the goodness and beauty of america at one level a slow walk through the <UNK> it's kind inhabitants and <UNK> grain at another level about growing old and remembering what is important and <UNK> forgetting what isn't david lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence a remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come
<START> despite disney's best efforts this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams i was surprised that it didn't strike me as over sentimental this movie played fair dennis quaid was very very good in the role which is saying something for a sports movie i can't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me here everybody looks the part this movie is surprisingly good and i predict that it will do surprising business as it is a g rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking ebert to the contrary this movie is a success
<START> i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie for instance the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by <UNK> with the other characters for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the <UNK> you could see the <UNK> side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was <UNK> but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad but if you're more open minded and i don't know actually have some <UNK> of what is good then you'll enjoy this film
<START> this is a musical adaptation of <UNK> oliver twist for the most part the original story has been <UNK> though for the flow of the film certain subplots such as the summer he spent <UNK> and the half brother are <UNK> the biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book fagin is <UNK> an ending very different from this musical film br br this is a one of a kind musical one whose style and scope really hasn't been matched before or since not only are the songs often quite <UNK> and memorable but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold whereas in most musicals a few people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed dancing here the numbers often run into the hundreds or perhaps more it's truly a sight to see and i was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it <UNK> and is one of my earliest childhood memories having just seen it again a few moments ago i would have to say that the film only got better over time great sets wonderful acting and singing this is a special treat that is hard not to love br br by the way when i saw the film again tonight i was surprised by just how high and feminine mark <UNK> singing was for the film well according to imdb his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would definitely account for his voice
<START> bored <UNK> henry <UNK> and joan barry as fred and emily hill receive an advance on an inheritance they use the money go traveling their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic betty <UNK> for mr <UNK> and lonely <UNK> <UNK> for ms barry but they remain as boring as they were before arguably bored director alfred hitchcock tries to <UNK> up the well titled as <UNK> in the film from shakespeare's the <UNK> rich and strange by <UNK> up some camera <UNK> an opening homage to king <UNK> the crowd is the highlight the low point may be the couple <UNK> on chinese prepared cat br br rich and strange 12 10 <UNK> alfred hitchcock henry <UNK> joan barry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> randolph
<START> considering that i felt like picking up a new jet li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting i grabbed this title br br <UNK> this movie contains more gun battles ala <UNK> <UNK> fat but nowhere near as good than jet li and <UNK> <UNK> fighting thus it was a let down br br the <UNK> fighting was interesting and even funny considering this was something <UNK> unexpected in a jet li film for me more on the line of say jackie chan br br but alas i'd recommend fist of legend <UNK> <UNK> master or even the <UNK> over this <UNK> br br rating 4 for martial arts rating 3 for overall movie score
<START> for those who like their murder mysteries busy this is definitely the one to see as it is chock full of interesting and suspicious characters most of them wealthy long island <UNK> types as the star detective william powell is alternately <UNK> and inspired behaving at times as if he and his suit went to the <UNK> and got pressed together mary <UNK> is very lovely here br br powell had made a career out of playing the lead character philo vance in a series of movies made at a couple of studios over several years in between these films he developed into a somewhat offbeat romantic lead at times even <UNK> gentleman gangster roles already middle aged he was stuck in somewhat of a career <UNK> by the time this one came along as with so many early <UNK> stars it seemed that his time had come and gone that he was fine for early depression <UNK> era films but that with changing times he was perhaps too mature and <UNK> to endure br br the <UNK> murder case directed by the criminally neglected michael <UNK> is one of the last of the old <UNK> while the next year would <UNK> in the first of the new ones the thin man the success of which would <UNK> its leading players into the hollywood <UNK> in <UNK> we can see the movies still in a somewhat stiff <UNK> pattern as the camera does not move much with the acting like the presentation <UNK> toward the theatrical there's no harm in this approach though which has its charms it gives the movie a <UNK> quality
<START> i very much enjoyed watching this film i taped it while watching so that i could review it later i actually enjoyed the second viewing more since i was able to <UNK> more of the clever dialog between natalie and adam the 2 main characters i thought the way this story evolved was very thought provoking i got very intrigued with how natalie was going to interact with her daughter's friends at first it seemed that she was going to <UNK> a lot of <UNK> but once she started <UNK> more pleasantly i had to see how this visit was going to unfold i wasn't disappointed gradually the secrets that sara kept from her mother started to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect a flawed human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a <UNK> mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately had to learn in a very painful manner that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them their freedom the viewers who stuck with this film to the end saw a very touching performance from diane keaton who is always wonderful even in some of her less well received films think town and country the closing scene of diane keaton driving home was well worth waiting for revealing that anyone who loves another human being has got to learn that we have to live our own lives we love others but don't own them and ultimately we have to let go it's a hard lesson but well worth <UNK> now and then thank you cbs for this broadcast it was worth the long wait
<START> if you make it through the opening credits this may be your type of movie from the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious <UNK> commercial it's all downhill from there br br the lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past and <UNK> the memories of photographs to talk <UNK> overlooked genius <UNK> who conceived the first computer language in the <UNK> br br the low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting or even somewhat integral to the script br br poor <UNK> <UNK> is wasted
<START> you probably all already know this by now but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on abc com i've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show ever it's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled the actors that played laura <UNK> carlos mae <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> steven <UNK> are all incredible and so natural in those roles even the kids are great wonderful show so sad that it's gone of course i wonder about the reasons it was canceled there is no way i'll let myself believe that ms <UNK> <UNK> had anything to do with it it was in the perfect time <UNK> in this market i've watched all the episodes again on abc com i hope they all come out on dvd some day thanks for reading
<START> have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie like seeing a detective <UNK> through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert yeah imagine <UNK> that image to a whole movie you pretty much got the idea of broken though there's no detectives in this movie i'm just using it as a visual example but the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99 of the screen time i got nothing to complain about that woman she's a perfect choice for this role br br i consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and i can truly enjoy some really moody stuff it would be really cool if i can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall let's be honest here the acting is superb some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching br br now onto the problem of this movie beyond the mood there's not much anything else here the director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth i don't consider it to be a spoiler if i say the obsession is mirror let's face it this <UNK> idea is all over the bloody place and that's all the director got to work with granted there are a few twist and turn here and there if you paid any attention nothing is going to surprise you in the end obvious plot holes aside br br now i'm not picking bones with this style of art since i enjoyed them most of the time i still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express movie is not a piece of music or a picture or a painting or even a poem and certainly not just a cool image in your mind it's all that plus a good story and character development i consider the lynch style of movie making cheating it is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium we gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason therefore we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting br br this movie is not completely lynch style thank goodness it has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion it does not have much story or character development it presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface it does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it the <UNK> came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental maybe the <UNK> remains in director's head but from what i can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen br br where did he put his effort in then it seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and <UNK> it with the music the music often built up tension which eventually turn into a <UNK> only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension <UNK> br br in the end i felt like ok i know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension it is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have and we are given very little about who the characters are all we have is this <UNK> that just took placed disappointing but i guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows
<START> slim slam <UNK> is a sad and disappointing picture there is absolutely no reason to this sorry excuse for a picture don t go there what ever you do don t watch tv shop for 10 hours straight instead that way you will be slightly amused
<START> mgm were unsure of how to market garbo when she first arrived in hollywood <UNK> had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in <UNK> justified that she did not speak a word of english so she must have found it difficult to work also <UNK> cortez did not make it very easy for her br br the <UNK> of the title is the river <UNK> that winds through a sleepy little village in spain <UNK> greta garbo hopes someday that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents <UNK> and don <UNK> <UNK> cortez are in love but he is under his mother's thumb and cannot get her to <UNK> to his marriage meanwhile <UNK> <UNK> martha <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> parents from their home and they send <UNK> to paris hoping to give her a chance to further her singing career <UNK> sends a note to <UNK> <UNK> him to remember his promise and come with her his mother is <UNK> and <UNK> him to go so of course he <UNK> in to her request br br years pass <UNK> has a new identity she has become la <UNK> the <UNK> of the paris opera <UNK> has turned out just as his mother wished he is running for office and is <UNK> a safe young girl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is a <UNK> <UNK> mack <UNK> plays her father <UNK> decides to visit her old home and i agree why hasn't she helped her mother out her mother is still living at the family home working as a <UNK> and taking in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> meet but <UNK> is full of <UNK> garbo is so <UNK> beautiful it is hard to believe that he could be happy with <UNK> br br the <UNK> is <UNK> and the <UNK> is <UNK> the town <UNK> house is in the path of the raging river but when <UNK> attempts to rescue her he finds she is quite safe they then re <UNK> their romance there is a <UNK> love scene in this film very similar to the one in flesh and the devil br br <UNK> <UNK> goes <UNK> <UNK> about how <UNK> really got her wealth and <UNK> mother believes her and tells <UNK> to go <UNK> meets <UNK> just before she is about to tour america again he <UNK> to go with her but again he lets her down he spends so much time listening to other people destroy her reputation what will she do for you but drag you down the irony is she has just <UNK> a top government job for him if he comes with her they meet again years later she is as fresh and vibrant as ever he looks older than his years <UNK> down by mediocrity br br it is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heart br br <UNK> <UNK> does a good job as <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> old and faithful friend br br highly recommended
<START> uwe boll has done the impossible create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game he has turned a game full of <UNK> and offensive content into a movie full of <UNK> and offensive content so as an adaptation it's a success br br unfortunately it's still uwe boll we are dealing with here so don't expect the movie to be actually any good while it does have it's moment <UNK> wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through br br at its core <UNK> is a satire on the united states as done by a twelve year old kid boll seems to think that <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier this results in a movie that sets new levels of <UNK> while being extremely hit and miss yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck high points include the director <UNK> himself and people getting hit very violently by <UNK> and other vehicles low points include well pretty much everything else br br after the initial surprise wears off <UNK> simply becomes a bore to watch yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of <UNK> of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity br br this probably would have worked as a short movie but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes although it feels twice as long there are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4 10
<START> this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time <UNK> ali and <UNK> <UNK> both look very beautiful <UNK> reminds you so much of her mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future br br the ending of the movie is very different from most movies in a way you are left <UNK> but if you really think about it in real terms you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie otherwise it would have been gross injustice to everyone br br the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness slowly slowly over the time he falls in love for her it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not watch the movie for complete details br br the movie really belongs to <UNK> i look forward to seeing more movies from him <UNK> is pretty but did not speak much in the movie her eyes her innocence did most of the talking
<START> while this movie's style isn't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been this is still a very good film in fact it was seen as an excellent film in its day as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar losing to wings i still consider wings to be a superior film but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is a general from <UNK> russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a hollywood extra his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call to play an <UNK> russian general fighting against the <UNK> during the revolution naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting wise but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution br br exactly what happens next i'll leave to you but it's a pretty good film particularly at the end by the way look for william powell as the russian director despite being made in <UNK> with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films
<START> this is without a shadow of a doubt one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of doctor who this is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question <UNK> with spine chilling moments this is an episode no who fan can afford to miss br br starting from when the pit was opened after the events in the impossible planet the doctor and <UNK> are trapped and are running out of air with no other <UNK> they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit an event which surpasses even the doctor's expectations whilst there the doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice br br meanwhile rose and the other members of the planet try to find a way to <UNK> off the <UNK> whose minds have been <UNK> by the beast also is toby <UNK> truly <UNK> of his possession by the beast
<START> i for one really like this movie for some reasons i'll go into late but i want to touch on why i think people don't like it first off there are people out there who just like to hate tom cruise i don't understand it really second cameron <UNK> i think successfully p <UNK> off two groups of movie goers with this film the casual relaxed not looking to think too hard group of movie goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete <UNK> at the end of the movie and the deep philosophical mystery fans are <UNK> when <UNK> has one of his characters completely explain the mystery br br this is a good movie and tom cruise does a very good job in it i think it's probably his best performance from what i've seen all though i haven't seen all of his movies or even a majority of them probably the supporting cast is good as well penelope <UNK> gives a solid performance and jason lee was enjoyable br br i like the story and i think that's what vanilla sky is more than anything it's a mystery an adventure and a romantic comedy but it's mostly just a good story and it has a lot of philosophical undertones to it and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy david <UNK> cruise is the man that had everything he wanted more or less lost it was given a second chance with a catch to regain it all back and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening chooses reality simplicity and <UNK> to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never get a grip on happiness br br many people were disappointed that <UNK> laid out the complete mystery at the end i think it's necessary the audience then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that david is aware of his circumstances and it makes the choice at the end all the more powerful br br and the music in the movie is great it's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is particularly <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> which is an amazing song br br all in all i'd give it 3 out 4 stars it's a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through and a great story for those looking to relax that <UNK> approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isn't a full blown mystery or a full blown love story it mixes and matches different elements and genres
<START> if this movie as meant to <UNK> people from doing drugs it fails i was ready to start using them i got waiting for something to happen and nothing ever really did this movie is neither horror or drama it's just the paranoia of <UNK> users this movie may win an award for the using the f word so many times and so <UNK> it was not well stated but i felt like they were making <UNK> to replace <UNK> they <UNK> to someone hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl just got more hopeless the ending really made no sense the movie made no sense unless it was just showing how annoying is is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a <UNK> head i relied on the other <UNK> when i decided to watch this movie and the rating on this movie should be a much lower average
<START> i have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as <UNK> kennedy i never got the chance to meet him but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him i hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow <UNK> by raising awareness of this terrible condition this man has touched people in a way that a million charity <UNK> could not i believe that this should be <UNK> viewing in schools i also agree with other comments what have i got to <UNK> about he took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour god bless i couldn't watch the part that showed his <UNK> being changed i have enough trouble with my son's
<START> i don't watch <UNK> my grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass i made fun of them it when i was ten it was so easy br br but this movie takes parody and spells it a new way i found the story pretty damn funny the fashions of the 80's shoulder <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> just top it off the huge hair the high heels and the <UNK> what a combination br br and all the actors just go to town chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile sally kevin <UNK> wonderful whoopi great robert downey refreshing to see him back when he had such potential before the <UNK> and <UNK> why did we have to wait so long to see him on film <UNK> <UNK> hadn't been missing her but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter and where do you apply for that job anyway br br admittedly i could have done without sally climbing the <UNK> lucy <UNK> did it how many times as has every <UNK> from carol <UNK> to i don't know who and i'm so done with it now i could spit <UNK> if i had them apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in new york i'm just thankful they didn't pull out the <UNK> bit br br but it was cute it was funny it had plot twists it had an after credits ending before that was common it had clothes worthy of a second glance it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me really what more do you need
<START> not many reviews hence thought i would add one br br do not go by the other reviews this was a excellent movie br br <UNK> is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie br br <UNK> and akshay given yet another example of great acting as does <UNK> too which was a little unexpected but great to watch br br am surprised there has not been much hype around release br br or <UNK> other awards nominations considering how good the movie was br br better then <UNK> i thought and i thought <UNK> too was good movie br br is a fairly long movie but definitely worth it and while watching it definitely does seem long br br cant wait for <UNK> next movie and the next <UNK> akshay movie they always seem to do well together e g <UNK> br br <UNK> too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future
<START> i saw this movie the other day in a film school class and i hadn't seen an <UNK> movie before but went in expecting it to be good unfortunately it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom high heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all br br or so i thought then the next day my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details like how the <UNK> depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule apparently the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this br br great but you know what it's still a bad movie it takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks high heels gives us strange off beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies and <UNK> doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point what is the significance for example of the <UNK> surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film why is that even in there just to surprise us br br there is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast and that's it that's the only entertaining moment the rest of the movie is just nonsensical <UNK> references and visual <UNK> that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart <UNK> <UNK> is but no matter what my film professor says it takes more than self indulgent <UNK> for a movie to be good
<START> i loved this movie it is a definite inspirational movie it fills you with pride this movie is worth the rental or worth buying it should be in <UNK> home best movie i have seen in a long time it will make you mad because everyone is so mean to carl brashear but in the end it gets better it is a story of romance drama action and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in i love a lot of the quotes i use them all the time they help keep me on task of what i want to do it shows that anyone can achieve their dreams all they have to do is work for it it is a long movie but every time i watch it i never notice that it is as long as it is i get so <UNK> in it that it goes so quick i love this movie i watch it whenever i can
<START> james bishop matt <UNK> goes to a mental illness <UNK> for a medical <UNK> assignment with dr <UNK> bruce <UNK> there he realizes that many <UNK> are being killed by the <UNK> who takes their souls to the devil in a cult promoted by dr <UNK> this story is so absurd and <UNK> that it is impossible to write a summary the dialogs are so ridiculous specially when the character of helen the blonde fiancé of james bishop arrives in the asylum that it is almost unbelievable that a writer has had the courage to include them in a screenplay and what about the return of james to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients and the cast composed of ham actors and actresses honestly i do not know what or who is the worst in this film the screenplay the director or the cast the correct answer certainly is all of them i saw this flick on cable television and i am <UNK> how can a producer spend money in such a garbage this horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurd of the plot my vote is three br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK>
<START> actually i never bought into the metal was satanic and stuff but this movie kind of played on that idea though certainly not a movie to take seriously or to rate really high it does serve its purpose in that it entertains while it is playing the story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said band starts to go on a kill spree from beyond the grave so yes a bit of nightmare on elm street plot going on here granted freddy never <UNK> a girl in a car before there was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it but it was very different in how it played out as it had a band that kind of took over a town of kids and made them crazy this one simply has the one fan of the band kind of helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him nothing to gruesome in it as i do not remember all that many gory kills quite frankly the scene i do remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the <UNK> and then being <UNK> by some creature incarnation of the band nothing great but a nice time filler
<START> if you've ever seen an eighties slasher there isn't much reason to see this one originality often isn't one of slasher <UNK> <UNK> and it's something that this film is seriously lacking in there really isn't much that can said about pranks so i'll make this quick the film was one of the <UNK> films included on the <UNK> video nasty list and that was my only reason for seeing it the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a <UNK> at christmas time as they're in a slasher someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the <UNK> mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because despite a few gory scenes this film is hardly going to corrupt or <UNK> anyone and <UNK> slashers than this friday the 13th for example didn't end up banned but then again there's banned films that are much less gory than this one the witch who came from the sea for example anyway the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it as although the audience really couldn't care less who the <UNK> is by this point it is rather well done on the whole this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss
<START> so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic tear <UNK> barbra streisand film something like the way we were i was certainly wrong the chemistry between the two main characters esther hoffman and her john howard was nonexistent making it impossible to get attached to the characters there wasn't anything romantic about it <UNK> character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast forward button at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she <UNK> him about five minutes later there's nothing romantic about a <UNK> rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on and i kept asking myself when it was going to end br br the death of john howard was completely predictable there was totally obvious <UNK> of his reckless behavior early on in the movie and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever it wasn't a tragic accident it was him basically being an idiot not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beard br br the only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs the ending of the movie when she sings with one more look at you watch closely now was my reason for giving this film a <UNK> 3 10 those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than <UNK> and anger
<START> zu warriors most definitely should've been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid the movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god demon wizard thing the plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie the plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i'm going to say they are <UNK> and acid trip like yes that's a word i watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand who am i kidding i didn't understand it at all it felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time i can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching <UNK> <UNK> at episode <UNK> drunk yeah that's right you don't know what the hell is going on don't waste your brain trying to figure this out
<START> words can't simply describe how awful this film is i watched it on video last night and i simply could not believe what i was seeing basically <UNK> is about an ex military man <UNK> lamas and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance style <UNK> the film's acting writing direction photography and editing are <UNK> along with a song called soldier that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time br br however there is one treat <UNK> ron <UNK> from welcome back carter is in the film playing a laughable bad guy otherwise please avoid this mess at all costs
<START> in it's time this movie had controversy written all over it like most of verhoeven's projects br br containing very graphic depictions death scenes a <UNK> that doesn't open <UNK> guys body on the floor a guy being eaten by a lion <UNK> teeth in the throat and a guy being run over by a <UNK> zoom bloody corpse going down br br but besides gore this flick also contains some brilliant and stunningly beautiful scenes filmed in the gray <UNK> town that is <UNK> br br thousands of <UNK> flying over the screen in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie a beautiful holy woman putting flowers in a milk can surrounded by <UNK> of blood dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters in a graveyard br br the story is <UNK> in a frantic but fulfilling 10 minutes that don't disappoint and will leave you <UNK> a breath of relief br br of course with the pros come the cons some special effects are too over the top and are obviously done to see how far verhoeven could push the gore factor e g the several <UNK> hanging out of their <UNK> also while the two lead actors <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters the character of herman portrayed by the rather un charming <UNK> hoffman just feels enormously underdeveloped making him hard to care for even after his tragic death br br i've done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie and as you can see it's not easily summed up in words so do yourself a favor if you happen to find this movie somewhere watch it and enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece
<START> moon child is the story of two brothers and a friend trying to make it in a futuristic <UNK> unstable japan after a cunning disaster gone wrong someone new enters young <UNK> life a special friend by the name of <UNK> years later they have grown rather close and have found ways to combine both their talents into one <UNK> team during another <UNK> they encounter a new friend and his mute sister who become part of their band of friends before long disaster again strikes and the group falls apart <UNK> turn to enemies and their worlds are all turned upside down regrets and <UNK> claim some while power and success take others tragedy claims still others truths are revealed and lives are forever changed br br and you will never see a more beautiful sunrise br br this movie is a gripping tale of <UNK> friendships <UNK> of relationships and a team that not even death can keep apart for too long moon child combines sci fi drama and action with the perfect cast and talent to create the most <UNK> moving movie of the time and great for most audiences it <UNK> the everyday romances and puts more emphasis on the important values we can all relate to such as friendships loyalty and believing in yourself nothing could possibly compare i personally have never seen anything quite like it and i don't suspect i ever will again br br it appeals to the wider population in many ways and is a must see for all
<START> mean spirited ugly nasty retro action thriller about a bodyguard who is determined to find and destroy the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect this film is almost an <UNK> in today's politically correct atmosphere director scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the <UNK> <UNK> behind the film's dramatic structure scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances i really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon so you better go and see this one while you can despite its relentless <UNK> i think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister exploitative and effective scott has a tough thing to sell but i think i'm a <UNK> the extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing and he pulls a great performance out of denzel washington sensitive souls need to stay away from this one but i recommended it to those viewers looking for a great action filled movie
<START> yes he is no not because of <UNK> likes to <UNK> his actors and show <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> is the naked emperor so to speak br br it's big time for someone to state the truth this <UNK> is a <UNK> a brat locked in an old man's body his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic <UNK> whatsoever it is 100 visual <UNK> he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their <UNK> and if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hard on did you know that on the set of <UNK> <UNK> he used to embarrass poor <UNK> <UNK> by telling her oh <UNK> how i wanna f you she is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became <UNK> ashamed to his petty satisfaction and as a worrying alarm <UNK> about the degree of <UNK> and lack of education in romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to <UNK> these visual <UNK> works of art will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all
<START> i went into this movie with high hopes normally i'm not too <UNK> about my movies and creature movies are always fun to watch or so i thought i'll list the good parts of this movie the creature effects all of the creatures were well done their movements were realistic and they fit into the other imagery well to be honest the creature effects were the only reason i gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1 now the bad things the acting good lord i've seen bad acting but this movie takes the cake not a single one of the characters is even close to believable it's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try outs from it i tried very hard not to giggle too loud cause i didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre but the acting really was that bad the storyline the entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish you can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film the plot holes of course are <UNK> with the cheese this is probably one of the most clichéd not thought out and outright dumbest stories i've ever seen put on screen since i had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching <UNK> on the scifi channel the dialogue this is a world where everyone says the <UNK> and most clichéd thing they possibly can at every chance they possibly can in this world it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low budget creature movies it is the world of cheese and cliché the special effects while the creature effects were downright awesome the special effects fail miserably yes they are better than those seen in other movies but a lot of it is in the presentation and this movie has no presentation whatsoever it looks kinda like the special effects used on the power rangers tv show to be honest to sum up dragon wars is worth neither your time nor your money the concept is good but it is trapped in the bad directing acting dialogue and cheesiness of the film wait <UNK> the next big monster movie comes out it's gotta be better than this cause dragon wars is absolutely horrible
<START> just got through watching this version of <UNK> and even though i still like it it's nothing like the rough cut version i have if you check the message board you'll see an <UNK> from the director for this cut down version <UNK> minutes and he says he had nothing to do with this r rated <UNK> down edit with a completely new screwed up ending christian really doesn't need to distant himself that much because the basic gore elements still stand up even though highly <UNK> down this is a damn shame because this had the potential of being one of the <UNK> and best gore films in years it still has the porn stars and the <UNK> and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen i'm just glad i have that rough cut because to me it's a jewel for any <UNK> library christian <UNK> definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods and hopefully his next project will be better produced the idiots had a near classic in their hands and screwed it up for everybody <UNK> may be one of the most controversial and <UNK> horror movies ever and too bad <UNK> didn't get to see what the director intended br br just so you know what you missed this is my review based upon the work print of <UNK> br br the movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops there is absolutely no music soundtrack and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog because i think they are meant to be <UNK> in later however most of the movie does have audio with sound affects and when an effect or scene is missing a message appears as a cue for <UNK> when the movie is completed it's exactly as it says a rough cut but the only uncut version of <UNK> you are ever likely to see reason because the gore is extremely graphic much more than even an <UNK> 17 would allow yes there are a few porn stars but they are just there for the killing and to add a little sugar and spice the story is pretty standard american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods an area that is heavy on <UNK> involving the ancient <UNK> and the celebration of <UNK> or as we call it halloween spooky br br the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local <UNK> mutants this is a great gore scene as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff with her crying for help all he sees is her head arms and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up she has been completely <UNK> in two this is what i would call extreme gore with <UNK> blood and severed limbs all over the place we are in <UNK> gordon lewis territory here folks except the effects look much more realistic i'm going to just skip the story because it's your standard stalk and kill plot br br the next gore scene is something to behold as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location tcm 2 stuff and bound to a table this geek then cuts all of his limbs off off camera with a cue to insert a scene and then we see his <UNK> on a <UNK> pit turning slowly over a fire and the <UNK> has a hard on if you can believe that yes very bad taste gross gruesome you find the right word and it will probably fit too br br then later jenna jameson her beautiful body and all is cut from neck to <UNK> and all her <UNK> are pulled out in graphic glee and her blood <UNK> into a pot <UNK> a real turn on huh br br but the best gore scene happens inside the house and i have to admit this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen this guy doesn't matter who is caught from behind from a geek and cut open at the ass hole the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys <UNK> intestines and what the hell ever else there is right from his <UNK> this goes on forever as the guy is screaming and more and more <UNK> are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor this is so extreme so over the top that i found myself laughing all to hell obviously you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd imo along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes br br so what to think of all of this well first of all even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation it makes this rough cut a rare jewel for <UNK> yes it's a little difficult at first with no soundtrack a few scenes to still be inserted and credits that have missing names all over the place but that's what makes this so unique and i wouldn't trade it for anything right now extreme gore yes yes extreme extreme gore this makes <UNK> tension look like a disney movie
<START> the theory of flight is an engaging character study of an artist branagh yearning to break free of boredom and mediocrity and a <UNK> ill patient bonham carter in the last stages of <UNK> confined to a wheelchair who desires to make love to a man before dying br br helena bonham carter exudes wit <UNK> and independence as an <UNK> patient who is virtually <UNK> upon people around her to take care of her br br kenneth branagh sentenced through community service to take part in caring for her <UNK> <UNK> charm with <UNK> melancholy creating a sentimental compelling love story in which two people try to help each other find the road to happiness before time runs out
<START> i have heard about this novel a long time ago many of my friends have recommend me to read it i searched it in every place and finally found it this is a book that every man should read because it is genius and because of it's vision i enjoyed every page br br i knew about the movie and could not wait to see it when i finally did i was very disappointed many things that are in the book are not in the movie i do not think that this is a spoiler that just makes the movie not logical michael <UNK> might be a good director but a bad writer especially as a book <UNK> the movie is not dark at all the writing is really bad the only thing that is good even great is the acting john hurt is an amazing actor and the only face i myself could see as winston smith br br what <UNK> me the most are the people in imdb that called this the best adaptation ever without even reading the book or knowing anything about screen writing br br you can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book do not consider this as an alternative as a fan of the book i was very disappointed br br the points i gave for this movie goes for the acting
<START> i was never a big fan of horror movies they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children they usually lack originality and contain overacting <UNK> the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon it was well acted and had a great story but it has been joined and maybe even <UNK> by stanley kubrick's the shining quite possibly the scariest movie ever br br the movie follows a writer jack nicholson and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block after months of <UNK> and silence however jack becomes a grumpy and later violent is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad br br one of the <UNK> parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes the hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty it is also <UNK> calm when jack's son is riding his bike through the <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> performance is also one of his very best <UNK> the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk in <UNK> br br the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the <UNK> out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project it may be a <UNK> but is definitely a <UNK> 8 10
<START> you ever get that <UNK> to just kill an hour or two doing <UNK> and watching a movie so bad it defies reason well out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the t rex knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the t rex from jurassic park i knew i had to rent this just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie br br i was not disappointed in the least br br mad scientists secret <UNK> a company more concerned about its fortune and <UNK> than lives and of course a big poorly animated <UNK> puppet t rex is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies not to mention the <UNK> hungry is never satisfied ever how he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn't have an throat really if you look down his mouth when he <UNK> it's solid like a toy or something now i like watching incredibly bad b movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is this one was hilarious i'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy because there are scenes where make no mistake you will laugh br br do i blame the movie's budget yes but the acting didn't help either ok tony todd was actually pretty good as for some of the female roles when you cry shouldn't tears come out <UNK> i am not going to be angry at this movie i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends here's what i recommend watch this movie then immediately watch jurassic park and then lost world back to back you will be writing mr spielberg thank you letters the next day
<START> this should be re titled the curious case of the <UNK> filmmakers who <UNK> a non horror <UNK> as a shock film it's one long boring tale of a <UNK> <UNK> a gag so transparent that even <UNK> from <UNK> house could see through it jeff east an actor in the <UNK> paying stage can be forgiven for taking any work he could get the same can't be said for charles martin smith who <UNK> acted for such cinematic <UNK> as george lucas and sam <UNK> once available on tape but thankfully not out on dvd <UNK> garbage like this belongs in a <UNK> and nowhere else
<START> this movie is an utter waste of time the plot is awful the dialogue is awful br br the acting is ok but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with the photography and some of the special effects are ok too but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch there is no logical progression to the story the story line is utter nonsense it isn't even scary for a movie to be scary there has to be at least a small element of believability this movie has no believability at all br br there are only three characters in the movie each character is shallow and has no personality br br most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done or at most mediocre br br i hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie
<START> <UNK> ron is about to marry mel they are deeply and love and certain they are perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago todd <UNK> brother in law to be is not so happy he is afraid the marriage is a threat to his <UNK> job in the family business and decides to <UNK> <UNK> bachelor party but his real plan is to put ron in a <UNK> situation get evidence and break ron and mel up br br comments supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic but it isn't funny at all it is mostly a <UNK> show and a juvenile excuse to show scantily clad women actually in a way it is almost impressive have many you can put in there because they are everywhere unfortunately that is also one of the signs of a movie that can't support itself it simply isn't good enough br br it has three redeeming points though or actually three actors that is worth a better script than this it is lead actor josh <UNK> who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense sara foster i know has more talent than to do movies like this and <UNK> <UNK> seem to have a lot more talent than this movie br br what is <UNK> absent are good jokes actually bad jokes are rather <UNK> too it just isn't funny br br 3 10
<START> <UNK> was an outstanding series its what <UNK> blue will never be on <UNK> the plots are real the dialog is real the relationships are real with <UNK> back as a movie <UNK> up all the loose ends it was good to have all the gang back together even a few that passed away show up wont say how the storyline was fast paced emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out homicide life on the streets network drama at its best 5 stars thumbs up and all that thanks nbc for giving us the finally we didn't get
<START> i saw this movie thinking that it would be one of those old b movies that are fun to watch i was so wrong this movie was boring and obviously aimed at males who like looking at <UNK> women the story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost my interest altogether it seemed to be in the same genre as the ed wood films bottom of the barrel
<START> released as <UNK> in north america to avoid confusion with <UNK> <UNK> own holocaust film europa europa this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never <UNK> to surprise inspire or downright shock is a bizarre nostalgic elaborate film about a naive american in germany shortly following the end of wwii the american named leo doesn't fully get what he's doing there he has come to take part in <UNK> up the country since in his mind it's about time germany was shown some charity no matter how that sounds he is not a nazi <UNK> or so much as especially pro german merely mixed up his uncle who works on the <UNK> gets leo a job as a <UNK> on a sleeping car and he is increasingly <UNK> in a <UNK> of 1945 <UNK> horrors and <UNK> br br this progression starts when leo played rather <UNK> by the calm yet restless actor jean marc <UNK> meets a <UNK> <UNK> on the train played by barbara <UNK> an actress with <UNK> on the surface but internal <UNK> she <UNK> him and then takes him home to meet her family which owns the company which <UNK> the trains these were the precise trains that took jews to their deaths during the war but now they run a drab day to day <UNK> and the woman's uncle <UNK> <UNK> as another one of those good germans who were just doing their jobs there is also <UNK> <UNK> the tremendous actor who blew me away in von <UNK> shocking second film <UNK> though here he is mere scenery br br another guest at the house is eddie <UNK> an actor with a quiet strength playing a somber american intelligence man he can confirm that uncle <UNK> was a war criminal though it is all completely <UNK> to leo americans have been <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> out of their element for decades but little have they been more <UNK> <UNK> than leo who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own <UNK> death train br br the story is told in a <UNK> <UNK> manner by the film's danish director lars von trier whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography he shoots in black and white and color he uses double <UNK> <UNK> effects and trick photography having actors interact with rear projected footage he places his characters inside a richly <UNK> visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects caught between glass for our more precise <UNK> br br this grand jury prize winning <UNK> work is <UNK> but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer i interpret it as a film about the last legs of <UNK> <UNK> by the train and the <UNK> <UNK> of americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the <UNK> of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned <UNK> during the time frame of the movie and the nazi state and such significance to the train are dead but like decapitated <UNK> they <UNK> in <UNK> through their <UNK> br br the characters music dialogue and plot are deliberately hammy and almost <UNK> <UNK> from film noir conventions the most <UNK> points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones two trains <UNK> back and forth <UNK> on one and <UNK> on another an underwater shot of <UNK> blood an <UNK> <UNK> sequence on what it must be like to <UNK> and most <UNK> affecting of all an <UNK> shot of train tracks as max von <UNK> voice <UNK> us to <UNK> back to europe with him and abandon our personal restraint
<START> <UNK> <UNK> my expectations and not in a good way it was even worse than i thought it would be basically here's the show the <UNK> are an alternate race they face prejudice etc quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created almost being worthy of jail time for the writers one show featured the <UNK> going into a club trying to pick up girls and then nothing else happened it was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute andy rooney dialog followed by death by <UNK> knives via midget cannibals for those who have not seen this show here's an example of the dialog you're sure you're okay with going out with a <UNK> yeah that's fine i've had like 10 thousand hilarious possibly the best writing i've ever witnessed br br 22 minutes of <UNK> with horrible makeup <UNK> tough social issues sounds like an entertaining night i also love how bad the recent ideas are that they're <UNK> to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercials i wonder if they'll do the <UNK> next so that i can have a new title for the worst show i've ever seen i would even say that this is worse than <UNK> <UNK> at least <UNK> <UNK> was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspired br br shows like this make me hope that there's a <UNK> up there somewhere aimed for earth br br <UNK> honestly
<START> the plot doesn't offer any new <UNK> it even starts the same as cube i this time there are no other <UNK> for the cube <UNK> except for having an extra exit which is not <UNK> very ingenious the characters are also not so well <UNK> as in the first episode they just became flat as in a soap opera br br if somebody makes it to the normal exit the person would be asked some questions like do you believe in god its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it doesn't fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps really there is nothing much else to say about it
<START> maybe i'm a <UNK> but this is the <UNK> movies ever i saw it for the first time when i was around 4 or 5 and i cried my eyes out between then and now embarrassed at age 15 i have seen it over 25 times and have <UNK> each and every one of them don't worry they're tears of happiness and it's not all <UNK> there's a lot of humor and comedy in it too usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case my only word of advice even if you love this don't see the <UNK> <UNK> i suggest everyone <UNK> this out you won't be sorry no matter how old or young you are
<START> note i thought i'd be the only one writing what i did below but i see the others here agree i guess it was pretty obvious this was <UNK> the bait the cat bit anyway here is what i had written br br the owners have left on vacation for two weeks a trip to california leaving the cat <UNK> all alone and locked in the house that means no milk but the cat to his relief does find a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> however to his <UNK> he can't find the opener br br it turns out the little mouse in the house has it and <UNK> the cat with it this is a mean <UNK> who keeps <UNK> <UNK> with the opener and then <UNK> it away at the last second <UNK> tries everything possible to open the can of <UNK> but can't do it br br this is a frustrating story and why they make the sadistic mouse the good guy is beyond me it's like some of the tom jerry cartoons where poor tom always gets the worst of it even though many times the little mouse starts the conflict
<START> i totally got drawn into this and couldn't wait for each episode the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be together with the effects it would have on those closest the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all <UNK> at the end we couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what <UNK> part in the whole thing was why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the <UNK> either very strange but maybe we missed something crucial
<START> what we've got here is a situation a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him in <UNK> ways at the end they are forced to let it go you can't fix people and though in various aspects reign over me is <UNK> hollywood that message isn't br br this story is not about charlie <UNK> adam sandler a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9 11 plane who's gone into a nearly psychotic state of <UNK> since it's about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson don cheadle a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and knowing about his tragedy spots him on the street and <UNK> charlie is riding around on a little toy <UNK> <UNK> a pretty <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> manhattan traffic with big <UNK> on over a mass of <UNK> hair the hair is <UNK> chief prop to show he's deranged and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every <UNK> wielding subway rider br br charlie is a disaster but <UNK> alan stuck with a controlling wife <UNK> <UNK> smith soon begins to envy him charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust <UNK> insurance money from the tragedy and starts dragging alan off to hang out eat chinese buy records or watch a mel brooks marathon at a <UNK> house charlie lives in a nice big apartment <UNK> by a mean <UNK> <UNK> the kitchen over and over collecting old <UNK> of <UNK> the who etc and playing a video game called shadow of the <UNK> on a giant screen in a big empty living room br br charlie's in laws are deeply concerned about him but also somehow <UNK> as we learn later alan has a new patient who is <UNK> him charlie's desperation makes us see <UNK> trying to help charlie partly <UNK> alan to escape from his own <UNK> realities but partly just makes him more <UNK> aware of them br br cheadle and sandler make an odd couple but that doesn't matter because it's convincing that they might both need each other charlie is desperate for the <UNK> of a friend who never knew his family because to escape his loss he is pretending he never had one and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste no <UNK> alan wants an escape from his <UNK> <UNK> life he's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners who lord it over him though it's he who set up the practice they're white by the way and he's black br br there's also the <UNK> patient from hell who seriously <UNK> things at the dental <UNK> but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she's a babe his <UNK> seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute he's also drawn to the breasts of <UNK> tyler a <UNK> in the same building as the <UNK> who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help br br <UNK> mad scenes are a little too theatrical as are a lot of the plot devices in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching br br charlie's not just <UNK> and sad but dangerous and violent and all these efforts to help him start to <UNK> the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people can't be made right this is an interesting movie sometimes a touching one and it's the first time 9 11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times many of the people are too <UNK> drawn and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful <UNK> only the manhattan streets look real there's a courtroom scene that is preposterous and donald sutherland is a judge who's too good to be true <UNK> family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call and yet this is worth watching for the acting the control and subtlety of cheadle and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p t <UNK> 2002 punch drunk love though that's clearly a better movie in fact a much better one
<START> well the big money machine has done it again disney very <UNK> takes advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video good or bad <UNK> with the disney <UNK> why is it that i continue to look forward to these sequels which make don <UNK> on a bad day look like <UNK> <UNK> cinderella 2 consists of three <UNK> already a poor choice doesn't one of the most endearing disney creations at least deserve a linear story of these three only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that i would expect the music is atrocious and modern meaning in 2 years it will already be dated and adds nothing to the story why does everything have to be updated you know the original cartoon is still popular because of its <UNK> so why not be <UNK> and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style gee i can't wait for a sequel to sleeping beauty instead of music based on the themes of <UNK> we'll get music inspired by britney spears so disney if you're listening remember we're not all <UNK> children out here how about throwing a bone or two to the fans who've been around long enough to know the difference between craft and crap
<START> the london underground has something <UNK> creepy about it with its long <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> taking you deeper and deeper underground and of course the rats <UNK> the tracks it a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often it was used in the seventies horror <UNK> aka raw meat featuring a <UNK> tribe living in a <UNK> tunnel and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to <UNK> on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep br br i thought the film started off well with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving followed by a scene in the <UNK> that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london however creep went downhill from here and i found myself wishing that i'd switched it off after this opening scene leaving me with a <UNK> impression of the film all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable even <UNK> herself and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about <UNK> he also made the mistake of showing the monster in full lighting where he <UNK> to become remotely scary and reveals his name to be craig how can you have a monster called craig it turns into an x files type thing and reminds one of the episode <UNK> in fact i was wishing <UNK> and <UNK> would turn up and sort them all out for me br br as for the infamous <UNK> violence it is very graphic disturbing and totally unnecessary it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any <UNK> plot value the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually <UNK> you to the rest of the horror which is a mistake as it's only halfway through the film br br so there you go the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell one of my favourite occasional actors you don't see him very often but when he's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner casting him as a <UNK> inspector was a stroke of genius unfortunately the only one evident in the film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> at least okay the paris we get is paris <UNK> city apart from the establishing library footage of the real mccoy but it is paris in spirit than which nothing nowhere is better okay kelly is no astaire but then who is and caron is no hepburn <UNK> but alan <UNK> is light years ahead of the vastly overrated <UNK> and green who scripted kelly's other <UNK> 50s musical <UNK> in the rain a curious <UNK> of <UNK> writing screenplays featuring songs by other <UNK> and just to balance things the gershwin numbers are far superior to the arthur freed <UNK> <UNK> brown numbers so alan <UNK> didn't have to feel too <UNK> the story <UNK> <UNK> us any more than the <UNK> kelly hasn't got change of a match and is a painter i e <UNK> yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when <UNK> invites him to dinner at her hotel in the well documented love is here to stay sequence the lovers are strangely <UNK> by <UNK> by other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and <UNK> traffic this is after all a <UNK> musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square as feel good musicals go it's definitely in the top 10
<START> how they got al pacino to play in this movie is beyond me this movie is absolutely terrible i discovered after reading some of the other reviews that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film which deeply <UNK> me because i do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as revolution it's not just that it's a bad movie with a lame plot and overall <UNK> that is extremely unpleasant but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by <UNK> or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible for example we see donald sutherland running around with a huge fat ugly mole on his face he does not normally have a mole the mole does not add to his character it is extremely ugly and distracting it's not like robert de <UNK> mole it's much worse why the hell has he got that mole it's as if the filmmakers just said let's see how could we make this movie even worse than it already is i know let's give mr sutherland a giant ugly ass mole right on his face br br another example of the <UNK> stupidity is the character ned we see for the first three quarters of the movie young ned at one point six months later appears on the screen we see ned again and it is of course the same actor playing the boy five minutes later three weeks later appears on the screen and all of a sudden we've got a different actor playing as the now older ned what do they think we're idiots good god again it's like the filmmakers are saying how can we possibly make it any worse i don't think we can oh wait i just had a terrible idea i know a kid doesn't grow much in half a year which is fine but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks just don't get another actor to play ned or at least get him to play the five minutes when he's three weeks younger furthermore the kid who plays the older ned does not look any older than young ned as a matter of fact he just looks completely different much <UNK> and no <UNK> or older than the original actor which is very confusing as i like any rational human being thought at first that it was a new and different character br br what did the first kid die while they were filming the movie because he was in it for the first hour and a half and then all of a sudden three weeks later the guy from lock stock and two smoking <UNK> is playing ned for the last five minutes of the movie and even if the original actor did die the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role and re shoot the <UNK> five minutes of six months later scenes better yet just <UNK> the movie completely never finish it and never release never even tell anybody about it because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time br br i'm not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldn't watch it it's so bad that you should watch it just to see how badly it sucks it's terrible terrible
<START> wow what a great cast julia roberts john cusack christopher walken catherine zeta jones hank <UNK> what's that a script you say now you're just being greedy surely such a charismatic bunch of <UNK> will <UNK> such <UNK> <UNK> of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary you'd think so but no america's <UNK> is one missed opportunity after another it's like everyone involved woke up before each day's writing shooting editing and though you know what i've been working pretty hard lately and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names right i'm just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can so much potential yet so painful to sit through there isn't a single aspect of this thing that doesn't suck even <UNK> fat suit is lame
<START> ashley judd in an early role and i think her first starring role shows her real life rebellious nature in this slow moving feminist soap opera wow is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme <UNK> or what br br being a <UNK> feminist in real life she must have <UNK> this script no wonder left wing critic roger ebert loved this movie it's right up his political alley too br br unlike the reviewers here i am glad judd <UNK> herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained not <UNK> the heavy handed liberal agenda
<START> if you want to learn something about the spanish civil war and about all the political details and <UNK> let me tell you you've chosen the wrong film br br this is a vision of the war as it happened in <UNK> a small island off the coast of spain when a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the <UNK> almost at once there is no war in the open the soldiers are sent to the front to fight in the <UNK> while another kind of war happens at home on the small island there <UNK> tell on other <UNK> sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime but many people are told on because of old family fights or maybe the silent <UNK> who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to earn some points and these things don't happen in the open there were some trials true but many other times people would just be <UNK> up in the middle of the night taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed and the next morning the bodies would be found and people would have an idea of what had happened but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything we're not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life we're talking about people killing their <UNK> and probably saying hello to their widow the next day and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed we're talking about <UNK> with one or two thousand inhabitants where everybody knew everybody br br i am from that small island and i've heard the stories my grandparents told me and i must say that this film upset me oh yes it did but i also found it remarkably beautiful and moving the initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up that's how things happened during that war a kid knowing that his <UNK> dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad completely possible all that happened later on possible too <UNK> was real too at that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become people were poor illiterate and worked in small <UNK> after the war there were times of <UNK> br br so you won't find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect there are no <UNK> no soldiers no political <UNK> this is the <UNK> kind of war which happens when the space is limited just check the size of the island when <UNK> fight with their <UNK> when members of the same family fight each other and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody you'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage or maybe they don't br br i must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who managed to sound really <UNK> that was remarkable
<START> this movie was excellent for the following reasons 1 it contained great backdrops and sets 2 it showed the <UNK> of a war torn environment alongside a technological one 3 john <UNK> acting was terrific he portrayed angst very well 4 it showed the <UNK> of everyone in a war torn situation 5 it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects i was also impressed with the acting for the most part <UNK> acting was i found the most stilted the morals and values of everyone in a war torn situation are up for grabs the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable great stuff <UNK>
<START> this was fun to watch <UNK> atmospheric and effects were pretty good considering they were bang in the middle of world war two the plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their <UNK> br br it must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940's when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the nazis well made with quite a serious message about the dangers to britain from third <UNK> br br but arthur <UNK> was so annoying unfunny you just wanted him to shut up well at least i did i suppose different tastes in different times but the <UNK> around became tiresome if he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded br br a good watch and quite short at just over 80 minutes a good background for older kids too so they have an idea of what train travel in <UNK> times was like uncomfortable slow dirty trains being thrown off for no reason <UNK> staff
<START> this is an extraordinary film that tricks you constantly it seems to be heading toward cliche at several points and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely <UNK> it would give away too much to say much more but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded william haines is absolutely delightful he is certainly a star that deserves to be re discovered the gay subtext in his relationship with jack pickford is amazing there is even a scene where haines <UNK> <UNK> chest pickford has a cold both actors play this sub text <UNK> and with great depth of emotion so that there are moments that are very moving and i never thought i could get so involved in a football match as i did in this movie and i don't even understand the rules also excellent is francis x <UNK> son ralph as <UNK> rival for the girl yes it's not completely a gay movie wonderful silent classic a great example of <UNK> commercial cinema with an edge
<START> the only reason i saw <UNK> was that it has erika <UNK> in it she's sexy as always but she plays second <UNK> to leading man wolf <UNK> it's a pity because she has more action <UNK> than she's allowed to show here the film largely consists of endless <UNK> that quickly become monotonous especially when most of the time you are seeing the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing <UNK> and him armed only with a revolver that never runs out of bullets taking them all out rather easily the <UNK> effects are decent but there is also a lot of <UNK> motion and poor cgi explosions as the psychotic spiritual leader ron <UNK> tries but the pseudo religious <UNK> <UNK> he has to <UNK> is simply boring <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> assuming he has any <UNK> might want to give this one a look for others it is barely worth a rental 1 2
<START> robert altman's downbeat new <UNK> western from edmund <UNK> book <UNK> was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following aside from a completely convincing boom town scenario the characters here don't merit much interest and the picture looks intentionally <UNK> and unappealing <UNK> warren beatty plays a turn of the century <UNK> who <UNK> in struggling community on the <UNK> of nowhere and helps <UNK> the first <UNK> once the <UNK> start coming in beatty is naturally <UNK> by city <UNK> who want part of the action altman creates a <UNK> <UNK> atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place but the action in this sorry little town is limited most of the story being made up of vignettes and altman's pacing is deliberately slow there's hardly a statement being made just the opposite in fact and the <UNK> actors stare at each other without much on their minds it's a self <UNK> picture and yet in an altman quirky way it wears defeat proudly from
<START> i thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it the actors were on top of their character's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great the music was lush and well thought out it even had a decent twist of an ending so what's with everyone voting it down the story wasn't entirely fresh felt like a <UNK> of running man with the whole television show idea but the attitude towards christianity and <UNK> about how the public picks their <UNK> certainly sounded true enough it made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a <UNK> because of his opportunity br br it's possible that christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word god in it but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this especially in the modern world where christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some br br i gave it a 7 10 stars here on imdb i thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original for the most part check it out if you're not too offended to see an entertaining film from <UNK> spain about possibilities of the coming modern <UNK> to a tv near you
<START> michael <UNK> is a decent actor but he has no business being the lead except in a low budget movie he really does not have much charisma <UNK> <UNK> has a lot more screen presence and sadly he is not really the main character most of the screen time goes to the brick faced <UNK> br br <UNK> harris from the halloween 4 and 5 movies plays his daughter and she is cute and entertaining but she is written as not being too smart and one of her dumb mistakes gets one of the main characters killed comedians fred <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and stephen <UNK> are here in interesting roles just watching what happens to these characters is priceless br br vincent <UNK> plays the <UNK> to the local mafia godfather and it is hard to tell whether or not he is working the movie as a comedy tim <UNK> is also in this movie he seems to be in every extremely low budget direct to video action movie <UNK> is also in some low budget comedies seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film made it feel like a spoof is it a parody of a <UNK> movie it is hard to tell at some points there is certainly very little <UNK> action br br the supporting cast of thugs and <UNK> is menacing and well cast some of these kinds of movies have thugs that look like they work at the local comic book store or as stock boys at <UNK> <UNK> overall this movie is very uneven at some points it seems like a comedy or a parody then at other points it works as a good action movie then it <UNK> to an end without the <UNK> of <UNK> harris and <UNK> <UNK> this movie would rate a zero in my humble opinion
<START> eric <UNK> the lady and the duke could have used a better translation for the title the english woman and the duke perhaps would have been more accurate while it's obvious this film is not for everyone judging by the comments to this forum it is worth watching because in spite of the intricate pattern of the story mr rohmer has created a movie that could be seen as an art exhibit in a museum the mixed technology used in the movie ultimately works well br br the strange story of grace elliott a noble lady who had been the mistress of the king of england and of the french <UNK> <UNK> holds our attention the setting is paris during the days that followed the french revolution the country was in turmoil and the power was in the hands of the people who couldn't care less for the <UNK> the images show the <UNK> running around with heads of famous people right after their trip to the <UNK> br br grace relation with the <UNK> had ended but she remains a true friend to the great man that is in danger himself of losing his own head grace moves through all the horrors around her without being able of an escape she even has an enemy in her own house in the form of the cook <UNK> who would not hesitate to <UNK> her at the least <UNK> br br watching the movie at times gives the viewer the impression one is going on a trip through the <UNK> watching those huge <UNK> that depict this crucial era of the french history rather than finding the <UNK> process distracting we found it to enhance the film in many ways br br lucy russell as grace elliott does a fine job to portray this woman who saw a lot during her lifetime her french seems to be excellent as it appears she is <UNK> in it as the <UNK> <UNK> jean claude <UNK> made a fantastic contribution making us believe he is the <UNK> himself without any effort the supporting cast also was great as an ensemble piece mr rohmer gets good performances all around br br for lovers of history the lady and the duke will be an interesting movie to watch thanks to the vision of eric rohmer
<START> he pulled the guys guts out his butt that's a spoof right no one really writes that it just happens like <UNK> gone horribly wrong i think any way this movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the <UNK> br br director says next our <UNK> villain uses his 24 inch <UNK> to <UNK> our token creepy neighbor get this he is going to pull the guts out his <UNK> br br brilliant the entire cast <UNK> br br no way can that happen nobody writes that stupid gotta be a spoof br br i loved the part where the skinny <UNK> gal beats the <UNK> freak to death with the cast iron <UNK> she finds on the floor of the cave i wasn't sure the <UNK> cannibal types bothered to cook much maybe that explains why the <UNK> was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the <UNK> hulk seems ironic that after the freaky guy had <UNK> martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type <UNK> he falls so easily to the <UNK> pan of a skinny <UNK> girl next door br br what the heck is that richard <UNK> guy doing in this did he fire his agent or something br br can anyone explain the ending to me please because i didn't get it either i can't quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea never mind i don't want to know
<START> this is an excellent movie it is about many things the hunt for a serial killer the <UNK> of soviet russia the drive of one man and the relationship between this man the lead detective and his superior br br the thing that sticks with me the most is the relationship between <UNK> rea and <UNK> sutherland excuse bad spelling please for some reason it is moving to see their evolution from <UNK> and offense turning into respect and <UNK> and working together one line in the movie sums it up for me he would say something witty but he is overcome with emotion br br excellent acting by all of the cast even the smallest parts were done with believability br br this is not a fast paced action thriller in fact it moves at times like a slow drama but it is worth it very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all br br
<START> i got this movie in the 5 bin at <UNK> i would not recommend watching this move i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours br br i looked at the cover and <UNK> through the summary and thought it was a war movie i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie it's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another the <UNK> <UNK> treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam br br okay here is my rant about this movie to me this movie is slow and hard to watch it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end it doesn't after the movie was over i through it behind my t v because i was angry that i wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it
<START> another violent angry fantasy from paul verhoeven verhoeven is a puzzle it's difficult to tell whether he takes his <UNK> <UNK> seriously with <UNK> intent or <UNK> in complete oblivion he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world and this has some outstanding ones cannot hide a <UNK> to story dialogue and performance kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered <UNK> and uses it to drive himself into moral <UNK> bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side the river <UNK> in an attempt to <UNK> his <UNK> looks given the material however bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to <UNK> the other principals are <UNK> <UNK> and josh <UNK> neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who when forced to deliver inane dialogue embarrass themselves the climax is a study in <UNK> and disbelief has to be truly suspended
<START> forest of the damned starts out as five young friends brother sister <UNK> richard <UNK> ally sophie holland along with judd daniel <UNK> molly nicole petty andrew david hood set off on a week long holiday <UNK> the middle of <UNK> their words not mine anyway before they know it they're deep in a forest <UNK> clumsily runs over a woman frances da <UNK> along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they're travelling in won't start they can't get any <UNK> on their mobile phones they need to find help quickly so molly judd wander off in the hope of finding a house as time goes by darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone that there is something nasty lurking in the woods br br this english production was written directed by <UNK> roberts having looked over several other comments reviews both here on the imdb across the internet forest of the damned seems to <UNK> opinion with some liking it other's not personally it didn't do much for at all the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with <UNK> screenplay <UNK> whatever that means the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 with your basic stranded <UNK> teenage victims being <UNK> off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who <UNK> the forest kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction then there's stephen played by the ever fantastic tom <UNK> who is never given any sort of justification for what he does is he there to get victims for the angels if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in the story is very loose it never felt like a proper film the character's are poor the dialogue not much better the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that's going on having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace there are a couple of decent scenes here br br director <UNK> doesn't do anything special it's not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at there's a few decent horror scenes the tom <UNK> character is great whenever he's on screen although why didn't he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly it's a shame when he gets killed off there are a couple of decent gore scenes here someone has their head <UNK> in there's a <UNK> someone gets shotgun <UNK> someone throat is bitten out <UNK> lips are bitten off someone is ripped in half there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity not that it helps much br br technically forest of the damned is ok it's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye catching this was shot in england <UNK> it's quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror the acting is generally pretty poor save for <UNK> who deserves to be in better than this horror author shaun <UNK> has an embarrassing cameo at the end proves he should stick to writing rather than acting br br forest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film it seems to have fans out there so maybe i'm missing something but it's not a film i have much <UNK> for apart from one or two decent moments there's not much here to recommend
<START> this movie is a waste of time and money throughout the entire hour and a half i continued to wait for it to get better and it never did it was slow moving the plot jumped around it wasn't scary or interesting and really never <UNK> to anything the credits during the introduction were long and drawn out which was basically like the rest of the movie long and drawn out numerous parts of the plot made no sense several times during the movie i had thought that maybe i had <UNK> out because the <UNK> of the plot however my companion had the same issue and assured me i did not zone out from boredom but it was indeed the movie i've actually never posted on here about a movie before and have been <UNK> looking up movies on imdb for numerous years so the fact that i'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it
<START> i had to stop watching this film a pseudo intellectual product for pretentious film viewers twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire <UNK> not to mention that i was soon near tears over the 3 99 i had wasted at blockbuster joanna <UNK> acting and her awfully rendered <UNK> accent are <UNK> terrible to set one to <UNK> one's teeth i knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many both <UNK> and <UNK> are played by <UNK> actors of strikingly few talents while we're on the topic of talent <UNK> <UNK> assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting <UNK> she clearly has not learned her craft in fact she's really quite awful all the public scenes looked staged with the extras walking <UNK> about in their sunday best turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on don't rent this terrible movie you will be sorry you spent your money
<START> i saw this movie a few days ago and <UNK> jumped during the scary parts i must admit i found it pretty decent until i started to think about what the characters were saying logical problems br br 1 her boyfriend who seems to be a pretty fit dude makes no sound while being killed don't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer br br 2 when the remark is made that the gym teacher is <UNK> in love with lisa i almost screamed at the screen when your best friend's family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with her you don't make comments like that if you have half of a heart br br 3 as soon as <UNK> asks the uncle how many <UNK> they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead wouldn't the smart thing to do be to get donna boyfriend aunt and uncle into a car and drive far far away then bait the house with the <UNK> and police force so that the killer has no way to get out br br i could go on and on and on basically the plot was decent the characters weren't <UNK> enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors br br however br br this movie might be good for teenagers or young couples just looking for a fun night out if you don't consider all the goofs it's a mediocre film
<START> julia <UNK> <UNK> travels with her husband steven harris steven man and their baby son alex to spend a couple of days with her family in savage island an island of their own the couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island while waiting for the boat julia and steven meet two weird men in the harbor and when her brother peter brendan <UNK> arrives he explains that a family of <UNK> <UNK> is living in the island the reckless peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the <UNK> off to show off however he accidentally runs over the young son of the <UNK> family but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal later the savage family claims alex as a <UNK> for their lost son the young family does not accept the trade and they <UNK> a deadly war between families br br savage island is a very low budget movie with a stupid screenplay amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting the flawed story is totally absurd and there are many unbelievable situations for example how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family the logical <UNK> would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue peter then the young family <UNK> julia and steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends and nobody chases them peter calls his sister julia of alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning there are so many flaws in this flick that i could spend many lines writing about this subject i believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are the good cast deserved a better material to work my vote is four br br title brazil <UNK> de <UNK> island of blood
<START> my thoughts on the movie 9 br br it was not good not good at all visually it was great i was pleased with the pacing the camera angles etc however the characters eh kinda bland plot it sucked br br this movie seemed more new age crap than anything else organized religion is presented as cowardly and <UNK> science isn't portrayed any better it creates a monster weapon that kills everything but souls have the power to destroy monsters and bring life really br br that's something that bites my ass a bit too here we have a cgi movie created with science and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that <UNK> will save us at least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask br br okay so now what or something similar i couldn't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit it was a okay it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let's get out of here as fast as possible type of exit br br this is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it just look at the visuals and nod your head <UNK> any thought as to what's the point of that will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing br br okay spoilers follow br br so basically a scientist creates the machine that is capable of creating other intelligent robotic life evil humans use it as a weapon however the scientist realizes that he is also at fault he gave the machine his intellect but didn't give it his heart br br the machine goes <UNK> on <UNK> collective ass and <UNK> out all life on earth finally slowly <UNK> down however the scientist manages to survive and create walking <UNK> puppets each one containing a piece of the <UNK> soul br br the last one 9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world he sees a strange device nearby and picks it up he meets up with another like himself 2 br br well 2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the machine 9 finds more like himself <UNK> sets off to rescue 2 br br they succeed br br 9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly he <UNK> it and the machine comes back to life pulling out <UNK> soul in the process br br the movie then continues with action scenes with 9 trying to rescue his soul <UNK> <UNK> br br they eventually succeed and destroy the machine they release the souls of their fallen friends who go up into the clouds it then <UNK> and we see life returning back to the planet br br <UNK> br br that makes no sense none at all why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 <UNK> what did it accomplish were they created to stop the machine everything is dead the machine was dead why bother br br why did he expect nine little <UNK> to succeed when nothing else had why not create a second intellectual machine but with a soul to fight the first at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success br br why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the machine and then destroy the machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps
<START> i mean the word pedestrian seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen faith <UNK> can do better than this she is supposed to be the mysterious vengeful <UNK> <UNK> torn by love for marshall thompson there's an idea eh instead she's a common would be housewife of the fifties and the single flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee as for the rest of the cast they are all so <UNK> all american that the result is laughable this is ground more <UNK> covered in val <UNK> in the cat people i think cult of the <UNK> should really be titled cult of the <UNK> <UNK> why else would so many otherwise talented people <UNK> their way though a slow moving predictable derivative failure like this
<START> i am writing this review having watched it several months ago the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie it is a complete joke and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like texas chainsaw massacre 1974 which they even had the <UNK> to compare itself to on the back of the cover art the producer who played brandon should go flip <UNK> and serve up <UNK> <UNK> hell he might not even be good at that either the lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn't even see the actor's faces sometimes i don't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable that's all the time i will waste on this review please stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents don't do it buy s piece of <UNK> at least it would keep you entertained br br if you want good quality low budget fun far better than this then check out a jeff hayes film because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it br br i gave this 1 star just for the cover art thats the only thing worth liking <UNK> this so called film br br rick <UNK>
<START> dahmer a young confused man dahmer a confusing movie granted i had a few beers while watching the movie but that doesn't explain why i got so bored by this flick br br its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and there's no real storyline with a beginning and an end the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie the <UNK> stuff which would be the movie is just boring images and a waste of time br br we never see actual murders everything is just a bunch of <UNK> sometimes you even just get a feeling that <UNK> dreaming the entire thing but you know he isn't since it's br br based on a true story and this actually happened at least most of it but what happened it's not easy to tell br br i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie i br br didn't like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> turkey a mix of anti nazi musical pre war <UNK> and agatha christie <UNK> spoof with one big big problem it's deadly unfunny besides the single <UNK> i q plot and dialog the most amazing aspect of lady is the <UNK> casting gene wilder star and co writer tries hard at it all he plays a romantic lead with his looks and his age he and woody allen should start a club for clueless <UNK> <UNK> comedians and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart and tries to sing and dance and succeeds in none a <UNK> shot from his good old days with mel brooks br br for a while i thought i was having a <UNK> fit because everybody in the movie keeps saying <UNK> jones is this pretty hot chick and that michael <UNK> is this <UNK> handsome <UNK> the guy who plays claire <UNK> male secretary is a <UNK> <UNK> thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies mike <UNK> over the top acting as the most incompetent <UNK> cop you ever saw deserves to rank among the 10 most <UNK> performances in recent film history the saddest note is to see wonderful claire bloom and barbara <UNK> completely miscast and <UNK> wasted at least i hope both stars <UNK> their bills back home and subsequently fired their agents with this flop no wonder acting <UNK> <UNK> returned to germany after she saw what hollywood had in store for her br br if you want to see how to accomplish a really bad film out of a really bad script with a <UNK> casting director study this one otherwise stay away 1 10
<START> this time around <UNK> is no longer royal or even particularly close to being any such thing instead rather a butler to the prince <UNK> portrayed by hugh laurie who <UNK> tim <UNK> who presence is sorely missed and that hole is never filled his character had an innocent charm while he was a bumbling and complete moron we can't help but care for him which isn't at all true of his replacement as being <UNK> <UNK> which he apparently was according to the trivia page not to mention loud mouthed and utterly non threatening edmund can now do just about what he <UNK> and does so why is he so frustrated and angry honestly it gets depressing at times yes his master is a <UNK> they always are he doesn't seem to lack money nor is he in any danger in the second series the queen was mischievous and childish and would cut off someone's head or marry them on a <UNK> here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting there is still commentary and even a little satire too often it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own so they merely <UNK> it not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags and i can't tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done literally more than a minute away it's not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered <UNK> doesn't change from last season he's still rather pathetic and stupid leading to silly humor frankly the amount goes through the roof don't get me started on the gross out stuff the sarcastic verbal wit can still be great though much less of it is than before i'd say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny while the other three didn't really get me into them at all i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were i could see many of such coming a mile away some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced this continues with the tradition started by ii of letting the plans work out occasionally the theme is the worst of the bunch the credits sequences the least creative all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general 7 10
<START> <UNK> i thought it odd that their ancient book on <UNK> was made using a common script <UNK> instead of hand written the acting is so <UNK> at times and so over dramatic at other times why would a <UNK> kill the two <UNK> quiet doctors who helped make him immortal just for the heck of it and is it really necessary to show <UNK> motorcycle whenever she's out somewhere we get it you spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate <UNK> rocket it doesn't mean you have to show it all the time the <UNK> <UNK> looks like an old school battlestar galactica set with some last minute changes there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance everyone is a throwaway character forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill conceived movies i've seen the scifi channel come out with stay away unless you're into bad movies
<START> meryl streep was incredible in this film she has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall i really felt for her when lindy was being <UNK> she was played realistically too she got <UNK> upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their <UNK> <UNK> i didn't expect much from the film initially but i really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events it turned out to be better than i had anticipated sam <UNK> was also outstanding this is the best work i've seen from him and i've really liked him in other movies the piano for example i gave the film a 7 but if i could rate just the acting i'd give the it a 9 5 and a perfect 10 for streep
<START> i was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the <UNK> first came out in november it looked awesome and the songs i was quite disappointed when i went to watch it this is a film which weaves 6 couples together it has a multi cast of 12 people a huge amount of stars have worked on this film i think the director <UNK> <UNK> has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him compared to <UNK> directorial debut <UNK> ho <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> falls quite behind i think <UNK> should have a smaller star cast i think the best factors of this film is the songs the songs are excellent and i think that all of the songs are awesome <UNK> <UNK> loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years i think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs one thing i was disappointed with is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by <UNK> khan and <UNK> <UNK> i found this extremely rude watching this with family although some may find this nude as comedy it is not something you would want to watch with parents i think the best acting was performed by salman and <UNK> overall i think its an alright movie
<START> because some people like me like to know everything about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending anyway here's the ending as i remember it because i couldn't have been more than 8 <UNK> old when i saw it for the first and only time on tv but i'll tell ya it sure scared the little kid that i was and i thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague <UNK> <UNK> was in this movie i don't remember that i didn't even remember that ol' <UNK> was in this movie and i loved dark shadows so at the end the lead character <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> by the judge joseph <UNK> i'm guessing even though i remember it as him being an old family <UNK> or something instead of a judge see how memory fades to the wedding place which as i remember it is in a <UNK> of some kind maybe i've got that wrong and shelley winters is there laughing and the judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he <UNK> he's actually her father the devil and she's played right into their the satanic <UNK> hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with i guess that's robert <UNK> turns out also to be the guy satan wants to marry her off to the demon with yellow eyes and yep sure enough they show robert <UNK> and his eyes glow yellow there are a lot of close ups in the last few minutes of the film everyone is laughing and <UNK> except for <UNK> <UNK> who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and that's the end the bad guys win
<START> i just got back from this free screening and this <UNK> witch project is the hands down worst film i've seen this year worse than even <UNK> which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction br br in september tapes a film crew of documentary <UNK> heads to afghanistan despite being thoroughly <UNK> for the trip the conditions and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous <UNK> of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on <UNK> 11 to track down <UNK> bin laden br br they made eight tapes on their journey which now document their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader the eight tapes thankfully all end at points significant in the narrative which is convenient for a documentary br br the psychotic idiotic protagonist who is given to long significant speeches that he probably learned watching <UNK> cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb <UNK> i don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said shoot me br br the <UNK> <UNK> supposedly their sensible voice of reason does little more than <UNK> and gets <UNK> as the idiot hero leads them into doom br br you wish they'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons br br around tape 4 i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew
<START> in the classic sense of the four <UNK> which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment altman's h e a l t h treats all of the <UNK> and actually in very funny entertaining ways there's the <UNK> as <UNK> by lauren <UNK> very slow <UNK> and protective character esther <UNK> who's mission in life appears to be all about appearance protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well being there's paul <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> who like a fish out of water perhaps more like a seal <UNK> around <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the crowds to <UNK> to his <UNK> madness the melancholy of glenda jackson's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of shakespeare's troubled and self righteous hamlet even <UNK> a <UNK> or two and let's not forget henry <UNK> <UNK> character bobby hammer the breast that <UNK> the baby rules the world then there's the characters harry <UNK> and gloria <UNK> james garner and carol <UNK> respectively relatively sane characters <UNK> to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme <UNK> who have <UNK> for h e a l t h a kind of world trade organization <UNK> in h e a l t h which is to say anything but health this is altman at his classic best
<START> <UNK> comment below you are a complete idiot <UNK> by ignorance by the very city you have <UNK> to its that whiny arrogance that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about sf that makes you seem like such the typical la a hole the only reason you felt the film was so self <UNK> about sf is because you are jealous of course you don't know it because you are so la jaded first of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals it says nothing bad about la and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over la they recognize that they went to film school in la and are obviously proud of that fact they recognize that sf is close to la which is a benefit the only negative thing that was said that relates to la was about the studio executives the same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them but then those same movies went on to be huge world wide <UNK> films so why wouldn't they have <UNK> towards the studio executive establishment and studio system these are the only people they are trying to <UNK> from and for good reasons don't be so sensitive how can you say that francis ford coppola is the so called san francisco director how is he not to be considered that and who directed the godfather coppola did it was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award so what who gave him the job he admits it in the documentary that he didn't even want to do the movie so what's your point and so what if sophia wants to live in la and that proves your point how and tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies movies that are now considered classics and when they made movies from studio funding one it was la that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to <UNK> their own they said exactly that in the film br br your bitchy and self <UNK> whining would take on an air of greater self respect and <UNK> if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film br br how the hell can bitchy <UNK> and self <UNK> suddenly have an air of self respect and <UNK> if they never go to la again what a stupid and senseless comment you inserted some big words in there and just don't know how to use them and by the way they never claimed nor implied they were superior to la so what if they are giving a guy from new york an award in la again what the hell is your point so if they go to la or new york they are <UNK> by simply <UNK> to live in sf you make no sense br br san francisco is proud of itself and its <UNK> and the people who make it what it is today this film just focused on one aspect film making for you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city not the movie but the city and its people only proves what it is we northern <UNK> hate about people from la this is a great documentary very interesting especially if you are from the bay area but i recommend it to anyone
<START> but the <UNK> here is usually i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb but in the world of b rated movies this one is z rated absolutely ridiculous the thing i respect about most of my favorite b rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously the makers of movies like that sort of treat the movie lightly even if it's a heavy topic i get the impression however that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously like they were putting together a 10 star classic complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots nevertheless despite all this i still gave it 4 out of 10 stars as i am biased towards movies like this if you're a b rated fan however i would try too hard to find this one
<START> i watched this in july and even with the christmas theme found it touching and sensitive it is not for someone with a reality mind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes don't make sense william russ did a grand job as hank i have only seen him in the remake of the long hot summer where he played a weak character but in this one the expression in his eyes throughout as hank considered the things that were happening to him was wonderful and tender valerie <UNK> was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role and peter falk as max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes there were many special scenes including the one where hank realizes who max really was in his life it's not for everyone especially those who aren't into <UNK> <UNK> movies and this is definitely one if you like everything to be perfect and make sense avoid this one but i think it is well worth re watching which is why i taped it yes some of us still have <UNK>
<START> watch a team of bomb <UNK> experts in iraq count down their time before they can go home br br that in itself sounds boring every time that little <UNK> came up telling us how long they had left it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home br br i must be missing something i'm a great fan of war films if they are done well this had <UNK> syndrome a film that at times was beautifully shot but cinematography doesn't stop it from being totally dull and pointless br br and get over the slow mo <UNK> coming out of the gun shot already they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it br br i didn't have any empathy for the main guy in it i was constantly hoping that his <UNK> would cause him to die in fact the film would have worked much better if he had br br i read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it and everyone else loved it i have never been in the forces and i'm with them it's pretentious drivel the 3 stars are for the cinematography
<START> i really tried to like this movie it deals with an important problem in any society sex addiction br br in this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex in this case our main character and hero for having non stop sex with all kinds of women crazy kinky neurotic puts in <UNK> his marriage job and even his life br br the production values are terrible mainly the acting oh you won't enjoy any of the sex scenes most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick br br second the plot is just non sense how could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband how could she believe him the <UNK> situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while br br also the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking wtf br br scenes like those you will find plenty br br avoid this movie please avoid it it's not soft core it's not a <UNK> it's not a dramatic feature it's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever br br only mrs <UNK> legs on display are worth the watch i caught it on hbo and i'm glad i didn't spend my money on it but those 90 minutes of my life won't come back
<START> it felt like i watched this movie thousand times before it was absolutely predictable every time the story tried to get a bit twisted every time i <UNK> something interesting to happen i saw nothing but what i expected like the bread factory opened up another facility because there was not enough bread in two words flat story that has become a cliché bad acting bad special effects only the dumb russian cop <UNK> was a bit funny while <UNK> around the bad guys the pile of <UNK> was so incredibly stupid that it made me laugh at him for a moment i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame of a movie it won't get worse because it is not possible d
<START> <UNK> hitler's <UNK> desire to <UNK> his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u s war department as an <UNK> tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii hitler's plan was <UNK> and well conceived starting with the conquest of eastern europe <UNK> to the european <UNK> then moving on to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of europe asia and africa his final move would be to reach across the <UNK> for the ultimate conquest of the <UNK> and the world br br in <UNK> hitler ordered national <UNK> as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell grade school children sang his <UNK> and young german boys received training and <UNK> in military camps <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> in 1938 hitler followed by <UNK> a strip of land <UNK> germany and <UNK> called <UNK> in 1939 hitler took all of <UNK> later in the year the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non <UNK> <UNK> with it's mortal enemy russia a <UNK> to <UNK> hitler's military involvement on too many <UNK> immediately after germany <UNK> <UNK> bringing hitler's conquest right to <UNK> <UNK> he would deal with her later br br it was during this period that britain still <UNK> to <UNK> hitler's thrust across europe prime minister <UNK> chamberlain felt he <UNK> a great victory for his country by accepting a <UNK> with germany his infamous <UNK> stating <UNK> in our <UNK> it didn't turn out that way br br the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment at least to me was provided by a small <UNK> of footage from a german pro hitler <UNK> in the mid <UNK> it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the <UNK> the <UNK> madison square garden
<START> this movie contains one of richard <UNK> greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not <UNK> the <UNK> also this movie is funny yet has a serious side as well what is especially intriguing about this movie is the character madonna who is the <UNK> mistress but eventually becomes the leader of the country <UNK> evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie's entertainment value and the main character who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a <UNK> <UNK> too and by the end of the movie <UNK> respect i liked this movie
<START> if you have seen the sholay of 1975 don't watch this movie if you have not seen the sholay of 1975 go watch it but do not watch this movie this movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of sholay br br amitabh <UNK> bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best probably the only 40 mins of the reel that shouldn't be burnt if you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character it would still be worth a watch but as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't do justice to his talent ajay <UNK> <UNK> is extremely mundane and the only reason i think they cast <UNK> raj in the role of raj is because he has a striking resemblance to amitabh of his young days <UNK> <UNK> carries herself well with grace and make up but the award for the worst performance and any role till date must go to <UNK> <UNK> she manages to <UNK> her acting to such levels that even high school drama would would <UNK> her performance br br if you have a mortal enemy take him to this movie
<START> way back when i was renting videos for free i picked this one up <UNK> the things i wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these 1 someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food it was gross and <UNK> 2 there is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way i felt for days after viewing this trash i figure they had something <UNK> going on in the track either that or it was just <UNK> bad or both many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent and don't even ask about the acting
<START> this must be one of the worst swedish movies ever made br br it is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006 br br i've never seen so many visible <UNK> products in one and the same movie it shouldn't be that obvious br br i can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie it is gone for sure now br br i've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i can't understand how that is even possible
<START> star rating the works just misses the mark that little bit in between <UNK> behind the <UNK> br br in this debut effort for nick <UNK> beloved man and dog they are forced to fly to the moon when good old wallace runs out of cheese br br as well as being the <UNK> feature at just 22 minutes this w g adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows the <UNK> animation is a little <UNK> and funny here sort of reminiscent of the <UNK> animation about the little man in the box br br admirable though the <UNK> behind it is i've never actually been hugely into wallace <UNK> maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation the only one i've really enjoyed is the wrong <UNK> and that was more from when i was younger and less aware of shall we say the <UNK> pleasures of life i was driven to <UNK> seek out this early effort due to the <UNK> in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation br br as technically impressive as the first two all things considered this one lacks the emotional angle it's <UNK> were to possess that being said it's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come two stars but a good two stars
<START> when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd they had not viewed it on the silver screen my opinion remains the same the subject matter is <UNK> and the performances are weak
<START> like tarzan the ape man 1932 only more so there's more of everything more animals more varied african <UNK> and scenes in which the thought must be if this was good with three or four lions forty would be better tarzan <UNK> with <UNK> the crocodile machine <UNK> in the water like a rolling pin around and around jaws <UNK> tarzan can kill it with his <UNK> knife if the <UNK> <UNK> would hold still tarzan kills lions and <UNK> and a <UNK> increasing number of animals his friends are real <UNK> people wearing larger ape costumes and elephants in fact they use indian <UNK> more friendly and <UNK> than african <UNK> costume ears attached to their heads the human story another white man worse than the rest shows up to join with holt to go after the <UNK> from the elephant graveyard tarzan won't show them the way so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its <UNK> tarzan <UNK> and the bad guy shoots <UNK> of course he survives and returns to save jane everybody else dies holt and the bad guy and every single one of their boys people are <UNK> especially <UNK> and there doesn't seem to be much distinction between the black <UNK> who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black <UNK> who kill them this must be the last tarzan movie before the <UNK> code made jane wear more clothes there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane <UNK> nude and though the light is <UNK> the movement and the glimpses are very appealing apparently one of <UNK> friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes and not maureen <UNK> she however moves through the movie wearing the same sort of <UNK> <UNK> wears plus a bikini top showing a splendid glimpse of <UNK> and hip they still don't need to talk a lot they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities no wonder they're happy
<START> boring predictable by the numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of mindless mayhem and gore to satisfy mindless genre fans mostly it's about giant rats <UNK> on a set of characters we don't care an <UNK> about if that's your thing tune in 1 2
<START> this movie will tell you why amitabh <UNK> is a one man industry this movie will also tell you why indian movie goers are <UNK> <UNK> br br amitabh was at the peak of his <UNK> of bollywood when his one time godfather <UNK> <UNK> decided to use his image yet again <UNK> has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it <UNK> saw the making of angry young man <UNK> was about being a bastard and <UNK> <UNK> was about the master servant <UNK> br br but then the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the <UNK> three hours of song dance and drama what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a <UNK> who goes to <UNK> and turns into a <UNK> hero <UNK> vocal skills and <UNK> saw this movie earn its big bucks thanks to his flawless stock <UNK> accent to me this alone is the biggest pull in the movie the rest all is typical bollywood screen writing br br amitabh by now had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies thanks to <UNK> <UNK> this movie had a good dose of them the shoe caper in the party the monologue over <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> challenge in the <UNK> and the usual <UNK> scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fare br br <UNK> kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody <UNK> character remember him asking <UNK> to <UNK> after the <UNK> cake incident his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant but <UNK> <UNK> knew the indian mind and so <UNK> had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie but this is a caper remember and as long as it stayed that way the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy the end is always predictable and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the <UNK> the age old theme of loyalty is once again <UNK> and all is well that ends well br br so what is it that makes this movie a near classic amitabh <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> created yet another icon in the name of a story chuck the story the characters and the plot my marks are for amitabh alone
<START> tom and butch cat fight over the capture of jerry mouse because the one who doesn't catch jerry gets kicked out the two cats dress in their <UNK> clothing to disguise themselves and lets the other have it confused tom and butch <UNK> their <UNK> rear and all three of them get kicked out
<START> <UNK> directed <UNK> photographed and brilliantly acted  <UNK> interpretation seems exactly right <UNK> has his best role ever while <UNK> is a treat too  this <UNK> appeal is universal and irresistible br br one of the principal <UNK> of the movie of course are the songs as might be expected bing is in fine voice and although <UNK> solo has been cut we can still hear him sing <UNK> as he dances <UNK> with crosby and <UNK> in their famous novelty number busy doing nothing it's also a treat to hear <UNK> <UNK> who although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema she has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing <UNK> she looks very <UNK> indeed in her mary kay <UNK> costumes br br director <UNK> <UNK> gets the most out of his lavish budget using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible perhaps the <UNK> looks a <UNK> too contrived but who's complaining br br in short as the trailer actually describes an entertainment delight from start to finish
<START> i got the first bill and ted movie for christmas and i had to get the second when i saw it in a store this one was i think just as funny as the first but a much <UNK> story it was funny how they had their own <UNK> hell and how they had to play death the funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clue the only thing i'd change is station and death being in the band but other than that it was great
<START> proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold this is most definitely plastic all the way its easy to see that without <UNK> involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years that's assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes angela jones is unconvincing in this role william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in <UNK> all in all pretty poor
<START> the number of times i've had tears in my eyes when watching a movie are few and there is only one time when i have really cried and that was when i saw this movie this movie has some <UNK> but i really don't care i cry even as i write this and it was quite some time since i saw it it is perfectly acted and all the production values are good but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message we all know it in our hearts but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all it's forms it's only when we love that we're truly alive i know how sentimental i sound and i promise i'm not usually like that i'm quite a <UNK> this movie has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first movie i recommend others to see
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one little small brilliant i started watching it and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new but as the film went on i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film the fantastic writing and the charming romance the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real <UNK> of one guy's life there's one very good reason the film got this feel and it's the fresh talent called <UNK> <UNK> he is extremely convincing as the simple kind hearted and struggling <UNK> whose new love <UNK> him to make <UNK> and fight for a better life throughout the film he is presented as an ordinary mischievous <UNK> but also as a helping and loving person who like anyone else will do anything to protect his love <UNK> portrays all the different shades of his character whether positive or negative naturally and with complete ease br br <UNK> <UNK> direction is very good his depiction of the life of people in the rural <UNK> is excellent but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of <UNK> relationships with the different people who surround him including his friends and his love interest <UNK> who he is ready to do anything for i also immensely liked the way <UNK> portrayed his interaction with his friend's loud and <UNK> mother whom he calls <UNK> <UNK> he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion yet we see that she <UNK> a very special place in his heart and is like a mother figure to him as <UNK> in several scenes except for <UNK> the rest of the cast performed well though <UNK> ali khan did not stand out according to me she was good and had some of her mother's charm the actors who played <UNK> friends were very good as was the actress who played <UNK> <UNK> br br apart from the performances the film's writing was outstanding the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant and the script was also fantastic that's mainly because despite a not so new story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look larger than life the film's biggest weakness was <UNK> <UNK> uninspiring music which was <UNK> for this film otherwise <UNK> <UNK> was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene the concept may not be new but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by the ending was bittersweet kind of sad yet optimistic in short this movie really grows on you slowly and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing the moving moments the charming romance the realistic proceedings and of course <UNK> <UNK> memorable performance
<START> i just accidentally stumbled over this film on tv one day it was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies this one however was nothing less then good br br october sky tells the true story of homer <UNK> a boy inspired by the <UNK> launch to become a rocket scientist he and his friends begin to build rockets his father is not to happy about his sons new found <UNK> and would rather see him become a coal <UNK> as himself or go to college on a football <UNK> like his brother br br the story is well written a bit too predictable maybe but that's ok cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story it's important part but where this is obvious the inner action the action between the characters is focused on the story is good it has some clichés but that's ok it's based on actual <UNK> so you kind of can't just drop out these clichés the characters are really good where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high you get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them they are well written and believable br br this is a good looking movie the sets and the 50's style is <UNK> and the pictures are well composed and well lit this all sets the mood of the film very good br br the acting is really good jake <UNK> delivers a great performance as homer <UNK> and chris cooper is good as john <UNK> as for the rest of the cast they are good too all together this makes out a pretty strong cast br br all in all i'm glad i caught this movie it was first after seeing it i learned that it was based on actual events if i had known that when seeing it it would probably just be even more interesting october sky is a good and interesting movie it's a movie i believe everyone can enjoy it's kind of a feel good movie not bad at all
<START> a powerful adaptation of the best selling book and the smash broadway play about the lives of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> two colored sisters who lived past the age of 100 wonderfully played in their old age by ruby dee and <UNK> <UNK> respectively they tell their story in flashbacks to amy hill <UNK> played by amy <UNK> a white new york times reporter the flashback and present day scenes don't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book but really are powerful however certain aspects of the <UNK> lives such as the inter racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father's stern personality are not presented clearly you need to read the book to fully understand these things which is just as well because the <UNK> just as great aside from those flaws it's wonderfully done and performed especially by dee and <UNK> and a very powerful and educational movie
<START> virgin is selected to marry rich guy rich guy <UNK> woman on boat likes sailor sailor <UNK> virgin <UNK> gross out <UNK> dinner man <UNK> on dinner table <UNK> does strip <UNK> for little boys man pretending to be baby <UNK> there is an underlying theme here <UNK> is trying to say that he is <UNK> ed off at the world to say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement to justify the title there is a scene where <UNK> who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie <UNK> in chocolate <UNK> it is a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in one's mouth unless one happens to share the director's <UNK>
<START> this movie frequently <UNK> quantum <UNK> to justify nonsensical ideas <UNK> by such statements like we all create our own reality br br sorry folks reality is what true for all of us not just the <UNK> br br the idea that <UNK> possible doesn't hold water on closer examination if <UNK> possible contrary things are thus possible and so <UNK> possible this leads to <UNK> nonsense which is nothing less than an attempt to <UNK> established truths so that all ideas well <UNK> and stupid are equal br br to quote sci fi writer philip k dick who put it so well reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesn't go away
<START> what a great film it is the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky the ending is not just a fitting one it's more inspirational br br but i am intrigued by the characters it is a pity we never see the relationship of <UNK> and <UNK> more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and <UNK> fear for <UNK> safety their romance is very enjoyable br br
<START> lock up your daughters is one of the best high spirited comedies i have ever seen br br it is misunderstood since it lacks the social commentary values that many films of the day 1969 required to be successful br br the characters are over the top <UNK> of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors br br christopher plummer shines especially bright as lord <UNK> a noble with hair too big to fit in the door br br the plot involves the usual 18th century stuff mistaken identities <UNK> romances corrupt government officials and jokes at every turn br br it answers the questions what happens when 4 <UNK> eager to party sailors are on leave in a small british <UNK> town and who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out br br despite doing poorly at the box office it has great costumes excellent music based on the mermaid theatre musical of the same name great lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic br br that it has never been released on either vhs or dvd is truly a shame since so many bad movies are released every day
<START> this is a true 80's movie back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays and that makes many of them quite interesting it was a cultural phenomenon that don't exist anymore nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap straight to video movies in the eighties are doing cheap porn porn seems to sell anyway this is above the medium trash movie level it has good fascinating story and it's quite well made i think in one scene you can even see the <UNK> swinging on the upper edge of the picture of course there are also little cameos by <UNK> and gene simmons but they don't very much contribute to the film success although they are good in their small roles the monster heavy singer sammi <UNK> looks really terrible especially when he's singing one of the scariest monsters i've seen in horror flicks i may have nightmares of him next night not recommended for intellectual movie lovers
<START> i'm not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but few minutes after it started i wanted to leave the theater for a while i hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized it's a waste of time there was just nothing there i stayed only because i had another show after it br br design some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design they look great while still on posters and <UNK> but not when they have to come to life they just didn't work mostly because the very same mistake most 3d companies make technically it is very hard to create really natural <UNK> in 3d that would make you feel that the character is alive you need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to create something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc those characters in the movie were made out of cloth and that just didn't work so they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer <UNK> where the cloth stretches or <UNK> like a piece of plastic it just didn't have the feel of a material that dolls are made of that's what those characters meant to be i think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters it just had a feeling of a 3d <UNK> computer game i don't want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen don't know about you br br animation was also a disgrace i am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in 9 it was stiff boring almost lacked any imagination or mood it was just a little bit above most average 3d animations i saw and that doesn't add to it any good br br and all that the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right that was not the case here actually the story was the worst thing in that movie it was below any level it starts straight forward it goes straight forward and it ends the same there is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development we've heard and saw stories of machines <UNK> the <UNK> thousands of times and 9 is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie the characters don't even have time to get into the story they are just there showing themselves almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what's going on it just didn't work there are also many repetitive action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story br br acting sound and script oh my gosh what can i tell it was pathetic bad story has a bad script and except dialogs like no don't do it i will do it but you cannot do it alone we can do it together but there are rules but we have to save him etc etc and so on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and run and <UNK> that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even <UNK> br br conclusion bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing only some good designs are not worth the time big no
<START> painful to watch and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters two of the main characters <UNK> the mother and monica the acknowledged daughter spend the great bulk of the film <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> respectively their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family <UNK> is unbelievable it wasn't worth the wait i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view
<START> this movie was not made by who fans most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half hour tommy <UNK> are simply missed or <UNK> over in christmas they didn't show <UNK> screams after the line tommy doesn't know what day it is they showed almost no <UNK> guitar shots in <UNK> wizard there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of go to the mirror and worst of all in the second half of we're not gonna take it listening to you they robbed us of almost every shot of <UNK> blazing guitar <UNK> huge <UNK> of the film are shot from in back of the band it's a very frustrating film to watch and doesn't deliver the goods i don't know if director <UNK> <UNK> is just not a who fan or worse for him at least if he is a who fan and this is all the eight cameras could deliver for him to its credit there are some rare numbers before tommy as well as some <UNK> that are very well shot and sometimes the editing is brilliant this might be enough to make some viewers happy as long as you're not <UNK> tommy the sound overall was mediocre in the <UNK> i watched from <UNK> it may be different on video or dvd
<START> i'm sure that most people already know the story the <UNK> <UNK> scrooge gets a visit from three spirits the ghosts of christmas past present and yet to come who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways <UNK> classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite br br while i grew up watching the 1951 version starring <UNK> <UNK> and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge i have been impressed with this version which was released when i was in high school george c scott plays a convincing and mean <UNK> scrooge and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing david warner is a good bob <UNK> as well br br this version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern filming styles for the 1980's which make it more <UNK> for my children than the 1951 black and white version br br this is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that i watch almost every year at some point in the christmas season
<START> you've got to admire director todd sheets for his dedication drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie making between 1985 and 2000 he made a <UNK> <UNK> films unfortunately if his zombie bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by they're probably all crap and a quick look at their imdb ratings seems to <UNK> my <UNK> br br part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding <UNK> a little more <UNK> than usual after they are attacked by <UNK> of the living dead who have escaped from a top secret army base located directly beneath their school working from a dreadful script by brian <UNK> which relies heavily on liberal use of the f bomb director sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind numbingly awful performances from his talent free cast dreadful visual effects some crap cgi and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space <UNK> and his trademark shoddy gore <UNK> of <UNK> pulled from beneath his <UNK> clothing br br finally after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives and unconvincing undead people <UNK> animal <UNK> zombie <UNK> finishes with a time travel <UNK> twist ending which forces viewers to re watch several <UNK> minutes from the beginning of the film honestly once was enough mr <UNK> have we done to deserve having to watch it again
<START> a terrible movie containing a <UNK> of d list canadian actors who seem so self conscious about the fact they are on camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable br br this film is badly written badly edited and badly directed it is disjointed incomprehensible and bizarre but not in a good way mcdowell does a great job with what he is given but is the only one in this film to do so he really has a bad story and script to work with it's not even camp enough to be funny br br i have yet to see van <UNK> act in a credible manner and even the sub characters like <UNK> with his <UNK> whiny voice confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a <UNK> off africa br br didn't the director see that the <UNK> looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit the fight between the blue <UNK> of lightning and <UNK> orange <UNK> of <UNK> for lack of a better word is obviously the result of bad actors with no choreographer <UNK> with completely derivative special effects was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film not the good kind br br learn from the mistakes of others don't even waste your time with this one you'll regret it like i did i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid
<START> the year 1995 when so many people talked about the great premiere of braveheart by mel gibson also saw another very fine yet underrated movie on scottish history rob roy although it is a very different film especially due to the historical period the story is set in rob roy has much in common not only with marvelous braveheart but also with the very spirit of epic movies br br it is a film that <UNK> similar themes like fight for dignity courage honor revenge family being a key to happiness it also leads us to the very bliss of scottish <UNK> where the human soul finds its rest being surrounded by all <UNK> of nature robert roy <UNK> liam neeson the main character is a true hero so universal in epics sort of scottish robin hood who struggles to lead his people out of <UNK> <UNK> by cold hearted <UNK> although he <UNK> his situation through the acts has to suffer a lot two things stay in his mind undeniably honor that he is given by himself and love to his woman mary <UNK> jessica lange that leads him to unexpected events br br except for the interesting content and quite vivid action the movie is filled with truly stunning visuals this factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves an insight into artistic images for me the most splendid scene was in the <UNK> when rob roy tells his boys what honor really means then he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman the scene he escapes <UNK> of <UNK> john hurt to the <UNK> is also worth a look as a stunning visual br br of course there is some graphic violence like in the duel for instance but i don't think that this violence would be as <UNK> as in many other modern films its justification is like any other <UNK> bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it the most disturbing scene for me was the rape done on rob <UNK> wife by the villain of the story <UNK> cunningham tim roth it's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away however all the rest is o k yet there is one aspect that made me really love this movie the performances br br all the cast do perfect jobs from the leading <UNK> neeson who fits very well to the role of tall brave strong scottish man to the supporting cast of brian cox who portrays wicked <UNK> a silent witness of terrible acts who feels comfortable with the evil of war jessica lange is very fine as mary <UNK> and has some of the most beautiful moments in the film there is chemistry between ms lange and mr neeson in many of their scenes john hurt one of the best british actors does a terrific job as <UNK> of <UNK> a <UNK> man for whom money is the aim in itself achieved by any means i like that <UNK> of his portrayal but the real villain is played by tim roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character <UNK> a man who <UNK> love who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter but like in any good epic this exceptional evil must find its end br br and one more aspect the musical score such memorable and sentimental tunes that are bound to sound in the ears for long the final moment touched me to tears not only because of the beauty it conveys but because i deeply combined these <UNK> tunes with the <UNK> of locations scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this movie reminded me of that permanent effect it was as if my second journey to scotland br br rob roy is a very nice movie very well directed photographed and acted it perhaps does not equal braveheart with its spectacular sets and crowds of extras in battle scenes but it is a fairly long film with much attention placed on one very significant feature a cinema should have stunning entertainment combined with heartfelt education i really enjoyed that film do not hesitate to call it <UNK> <UNK> of entertainment and rate it 9 10
<START> storyline the film <UNK> 4 odd hours covers in adequate details the happenings at the <UNK> <UNK> near the <UNK> in 1999 when the <UNK> <UNK> had crossed the <UNK> and had entered deep into the indian territory and the indian <UNK> to know more about the story i would suggest readers to read the news items <UNK> to <UNK> br br comment if one is looking for a formula story in this movie then one can be sure that it is absent <UNK> is a story of pure sacrifice <UNK> courage and lots and lots of bullets and blood the movie hall where i saw this film was full of <UNK> and cheers when the film shows indian bravery movie audience seemed similar to audiences like in an india vs <UNK> <UNK> match br br watch the movie as a tribute to the <UNK> sacrifice and for the characterization of the real life war heroes 4 <UNK> <UNK> heroes who have sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day the movie has made a brilliant portrayal of the army who have <UNK> all odds in rough weather conditions the film's <UNK> are that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring
<START> i have never seen any of spike lee's prior films as their trailers never caught my interest i have seen and admire denzel washington and jodie <UNK> work and have several of their dvds i was however entirely disappointed with this movie if this film is any indication of spike lee's ability as a director my advice would be to get a job and stop wasting the time and talent of others br br i wonder if some of the other imdb <UNK> watched the same movie that i'd seen i can only assume from their sappy <UNK> reviews that their <UNK> of spike lee has <UNK> them to the <UNK> of this piece of work i only paid 2 50 in a second run theater and still felt i'd wasted my money br br the imdb trivia page says it all br br shot in <UNK> days how can you expect to shoot a big budget blockbuster as the media hype promised in such a short time no wonder there was such a weak performance by all br br ron howard was first going to direct the film he may have done this project some justice given more time to do so of course though the writing was atrocious the premise had some merits br br ok maybe not i'm sorry this film was so <UNK> with pitiful <UNK> implausible scenes and lousy characterizations that maybe even he couldn't have made much of it hey ron be sure to thank russell good call br br jodie foster filmed her part in three weeks and it showed her portrayal of a <UNK> who makes people's problems go away was as unbelievable as the script she was given did she even want to be there br br other <UNK> br br how many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a <UNK> police officer that they were inside robbing the bank and he'd better keep away or else br br when detective <UNK> denzel washington comes into the bank to <UNK> there are no corpses yet how many bank robbers without a gun would have led a cop much less let a cop back out to the front door allowing the police officer to walk behind him br br <UNK> <UNK> later claimed to have given the <UNK> every reason to shoot me why then in their brief struggle didn't he even try to expose the <UNK> face that may have gotten the response he was looking for a <UNK> would have shot him just to prevent later <UNK> and why did it take steve <UNK> steve o the <UNK> <UNK> so long to come and help out br br i understand that these weren't your typical bank robbers they had a different agenda and didn't want anyone <UNK> but the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn't to them it was a desperate situation why then when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the <UNK> were they not taken down first of all how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield is this spike lee's version of ny city or <UNK> taking them down would have reduced the bad guy's numbers screwed up their plans and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up if not there at least would be fewer bad guys inside give <UNK> something to do or send them home br br what police department in this country would have allowed <UNK> white jodie foster to just <UNK> right into the bank and discuss a matter with the robbers that she would not <UNK> to them first she had no authority no <UNK> <UNK> and besides this was after all already a hostage situation add one more br br why wouldn't the bank <UNK> christopher plummer just have destroyed the <UNK> documents a long time ago screw sentimentality the <UNK> he could have sold br br who was that <UNK> the character not the actor with the jersey accent that conveniently <UNK> and said he knew the recording was 100 <UNK> but yet he himself couldn't speak it sir put your hand down and his ex wife what a <UNK> she was both were totally unbelievable br br when <UNK> suspects why did <UNK> <UNK> continually <UNK> the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist i e telling the elderly woman she could go and then she couldn't then could then couldn't give me a break br br who after seeing the bank robbers demand that the <UNK> put on jump <UNK> couldn't <UNK> their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the <UNK> br br near the end of the movie a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room behind which clive <UNK> <UNK> out for a week where did the <UNK> come from the <UNK> <UNK> it was also to be assumed that they cut into the <UNK> so he could <UNK> himself the bank employees hadn't complained about the smell all week long hello br br after such a <UNK> since the documents had fallen into the <UNK> hands what kind of references was ms white expecting to get from the bank <UNK> seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail due to her failure br br and last but certainly not least what's with the electric <UNK> that denzel did how stupid was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice he looked rather like a man who <UNK> a ride on a shopping <UNK> while trying to prevent a <UNK> movement <UNK> <UNK> br br other than the mediocre plot lousy script bad acting and overall pitiful directing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not br br
<START> sudden impact was overall better than the <UNK> in my opinion it was building up to be a great movie but then i saw the villain s and was disappointed br br sudden impact was different than the previous <UNK> the plot went a different direction in this movie as dirty harry doesn't take as much of a police approach this time around we also don't see the villain s until later which means less screen time for them which is better for us all br br clint eastwood once again steals the show as dirty harry enough said pat <UNK> was enjoyable as chief <UNK> harry's new assigned boss <UNK> <UNK> seemed to change his name to captain <UNK> here either way he wasn't any different michael <UNK> is decent as lt <UNK> harry's annoying superior i personally enjoyed <UNK> major howard as <UNK> the young punk who has a <UNK> against harry albert <UNK> was excellent as <UNK> harry's buddy <UNK> j <UNK> was good as ray <UNK> a famous lesbian around town jack <UNK> was well cast as <UNK> a <UNK> now for the really bad part sandra locke eastwood's long time lover was horribly miscast as jennifer spencer harry's love interest and paul drake was just horrible as mick br br the movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts br br 8 10
<START> this was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs the actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six it was still funny season 8 was the real problem kicked in without <UNK> grace or <UNK> <UNK> the show simply fell apart not too say the other actors weren't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as danny masterson wilder <UNK> <UNK> smith debra jo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and laura <UNK> don <UNK> and tommy chong are great too left the show it would have the same affect and the inclusion of randy josh meyers didn't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans i believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom <UNK> season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent i am going to miss the show i just hope i wake up one day to find out the show is back as that 80's show with the same cast because i am going to miss the hell out of it
<START> the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and <UNK> to <UNK> recreate h g <UNK> classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year e g the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who <UNK> themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important <UNK> like being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to h g <UNK> classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings
<START> <UNK> as a gay man who lives in nyc i can <UNK> say that i have never seen the <UNK> of gay culture that is portrayed in this film and i am glad of it was this film broadcast on tv across the united states there would be a great anti gay <UNK> and i cannot say that i would blame them the people in this film do not represent the average gay american or even the average <UNK> american what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare the inclusion of obviously <UNK> characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments anti white are blatant and unsettling society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs <UNK> and <UNK> of education on the part of the film's cast the actions of these people are not acts of desperation but rather a <UNK> of anything resembling personal ambition and a <UNK> to make something out of one's self
<START> a kid with ideals who tries to change things around him a boy who is forced to become a man because of the system a system who hides the truth and who is <UNK> the rights of existence a boy who inspired by martin <UNK> king stands up and tells the truth a family who is falling apart and fighting against it a movie you can't hide from you see things and you hear things and you feel things that you till the day you die will hope have never happened for real violence frustration abuse of power parents who can't do anything and a boy with i am sorry balls a boy who will not accept things who will not let anything happen to him a kid with power and a kid who acts like a pro like he has never done anything else he <UNK> this movie to the end and anyone who wants to see how abuse found place back in the <UNK>
<START> it's a really cheesy parody of tomb <UNK> and some indiana jones the <UNK> cheesy and so is the acting but after all it is a soft core movie which is expected and doesn't matter because what you really want is the sex which gets me to the biggest problem of all there barely is any of it which makes you feel like you're watching tv at 3 am and the independent movies are playing and the one that is on was made by some college kid that's going nowhere in that industry you're left a very long time waiting for an actual sex scene a lot of times you are thinking something is going to happen then just left hanging the one maybe two or one with two parts that actually goes somewhere is very pleasing though i personally can't recommend this unless you found it in a clear out bin for a dollar or two if you <UNK> for a good movie with a plot and good acting you don't want this if you looking for a good soft core lesbian film you don't want this either
<START> the first home alone was one of the funniest movies of the 90's the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes now comes home alone 3 i was curious how they could continue with the same story considering kevin would've been 17 by 1997 he could take care of himself right so what does the director decide to do he takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick the kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house what kind of team of <UNK> are these idiots i don't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie but please i'd recommend that you'd stay away from it it's not worth your precious time go <UNK> a piece of paper do <UNK> balance a <UNK> on your nose or take a <UNK> it's better to do then to watch home alone 3 br br 1 10
<START> masters of horror has proved itself a poor <UNK> for <UNK> episodes ' and while a definite case can be made for joe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one of the best episodes of the series period most efforts to do so have come across as <UNK> heavy and unimpressive nothing <UNK> horror more than a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> simply <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with ultra violence young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seen running through the woods is nearly hit by 2 doctors mark <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who just happen to be driving in to work at the local and isolated abortion clinic <UNK> father <UNK> ron <UNK> is a stone cold far right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion if for nothing else <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> some buzz for its controversial issue but john carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself which is admittedly poor the slow pacing builds no tension and simply brings the already <UNK> plot to a crawl even when <UNK> and his sons storm the clinic guns blazing it is a stunning non event later when a doctor is tortured with a <UNK> abortion ' the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary an effort to pad out the <UNK> film the poor performances <UNK> is sadly wasted here become an <UNK> of the script and carpenter's direction feels exhausted as if <UNK> <UNK> is the source of his next hot meal by the time a spider creature with a human head and a guy in a <UNK> monster suit are <UNK> the <UNK> you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking
<START> add pure humor quick and unique sentences sex <UNK> sex love lies dark deadly thoughts secret plans fun black humor sex again black dresses needed for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or in english crimes our heroes are two married couples their relatives their friends and neighbors there is <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> two married couples who have everything but not real love <UNK> is the mistress of <UNK> and when <UNK> finds what's going on she is planning with her best friend <UNK> to kill <UNK> and look like an accident many plans were made but everyone else dies except <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out that he has a sister who is a hooker and tries to put her in the right road <UNK> is a temptation to <UNK> but her tries to get married all goes wrong since when they learn her past freaks and leave and she ends up marrying a rich farm man as for the other roles they are like they are from cartoons grandpa <UNK> which <UNK> that he is <UNK> <UNK> is his nurse who is secretly marry to <UNK> for his fortune <UNK> son of <UNK> who has it ok with everybody to have all the benefits <UNK> who has only one purpose in life to suicide but he is unable to do it so he is desperate every time i see the <UNK> and every time when it finishes i miss it one of my favorite all time classics
<START> a fine martino outing this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and <UNK> the two leads george hilton and anita <UNK> br br for me the <UNK> saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to <UNK> just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists enjoyable twists it has to be said br br sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london <UNK> and greek <UNK> locations a super finale set upon <UNK> rocks <UNK> things up and much fun was had by all
<START> i saw this 25 years ago on <UNK> it was very difficult to watch so real to watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart <UNK> no time for <UNK> fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the <UNK> and make it work this was based on the woman's actual diary which i read many years later she said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves she learned to <UNK> which was not lady like she was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun <UNK> <UNK> hands but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to <UNK> and she was happy to do it both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home it was so so sad when the baby died of course if they had it today i am sure it would have been fine that only makes the tragedy extra sad i was crying so hard but then they went out and successfully pulled out a new <UNK> spring is on its way and life goes on in her diary she did have two more boys and they lived
<START> a bad one br br oh my this is one of the movies which doesn't have even one positive effect just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky i just wonder how low i q you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy br br is there something than this is worth watching for well there is a lot of nudity involved but it's nothing particular and when you just think that it couldn't get worse your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old c'mon guys where did you search for these actresses in elderly home perhaps br br anyway the leading actresses has some sex appeal and knows how to show it again too bad that she is too skinny old all in all skip these one br br 2 out of 10
<START> everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie my grandma could have done better than that but that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad it's actually so bad that i'm not able to write a sentence without <UNK> mark if the first episode of <UNK> <UNK> was a quite good <UNK> comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is <UNK> badly the <UNK> of the first one the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it <UNK> is over acting his role even more than in the first part robin is trying to act like <UNK> because she's replacing her but that's <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> robin is robin even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played <UNK> playing her <UNK> as for the story it's just too much of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but <UNK> and <UNK> should <UNK> tried to write a more simple story like the first episode the gags are repetitive childish and <UNK> <UNK> no really there's no more than 3 funny parts in this the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects so you have only 2 reasons to watch it 1 if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie 2 if you want to waste your time or if you really need a <UNK> <UNK> 2 10
<START> sisters in law will be released <UNK> on march <UNK> in sweden a good occasion for our <UNK> friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary it was shown in <UNK> together with a <UNK> dedicated to kim <UNK> director in focus of the festival she gave a master class very much appreciated telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice the first version got lost for good so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end a pretty awful problem happened in this case to create the possibility of a very strong movie
<START> i don't believe this was an acting challenge for richard harris this was an <UNK> plot yet interesting it is a good movie to watch when you don't want to do a lot of thinking just want to be told a simple story the canadian scenery was breathtaking the beautiful fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing
<START> even for the cocaine laced 1980's this is a pathetic i don't understand why someone would want to waste celluloid time effort money and audience brain cells to make such drivel if your going to make a comedy make it funny if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself if you're going to release it as a joke like this don't i mean it was a joke right someone please tell me this was a joke please
<START> this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message both in form and content that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film there are barely opening or closing credits we are just dropped into the world of <UNK> art revolution and youth this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary but this time we do it for the sake of <UNK> and marketing not for describing the real
<START> this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the <UNK> in my opinion a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her and at this point i will say that these films are not real they are <UNK> horror films which try to be as realistic as possible br br the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases for example when they kick the girl in the floor we can clearly see how they kick and <UNK> the floor near the girl and how stupid this looks the sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours the ripping off of <UNK> worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body the eye <UNK> and <UNK> in horrific detail and stuff like that very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or <UNK> significant this first entry is the <UNK> and most amateurish guinea pig although it is not as bloody as the next part flowers of flesh and blood which tries to be as shocking as possible br br guinea pig devil's experiment is perhaps the <UNK> thing i've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is this is still of course <UNK> s n t <UNK> the only difference to genuine snuff film is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film i cannot recommend this to anyone since <UNK> s is so s y and repulsive they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it i watched this as a curiosity as the other parts in the series and now i know how insignificant trash these are they work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement devil's experiment is perhaps the <UNK> film i've seen and mermaid in a <UNK> guinea pig 4 is perhaps the most disgusting film i've seen so these are pretty extreme in my book but that's all they are
<START> i saw this movie at sundance 2005 and was stunned at how bad it was although based on the <UNK> description i was excited to see it supposedly a <UNK> of two high school students making a documentary of high school life it featured bad acting bad directing completely lack of engaging characters as written and all around is a total bust i love good movies about high school and this is not one of them the characters are one dimensional and self <UNK> cool although they are supposed to be <UNK> you get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making an on <UNK> bad movie to show their friends yet somehow it got into sundance <UNK>
<START> reese <UNK> plays dani a young country girl that falls <UNK> in love with the new 17 year old neighbor court played by jason london court tries his best to make dani realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship improbable soon the <UNK> charm of dani starts winning over <UNK> will next enters the meeting of <UNK> older sister played by emily <UNK> and the beginning of a short lived love jealousy problem br br tess <UNK> and sam <UNK> round out the cast this is a fresh free spirited but heartbreaking drama that touches down deep feel free to cry
<START> something about the 40 year old virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer wedding <UNK> is similar but they are two different films in some respects both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over the top crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their <UNK> along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films both have some sort of formula to the stories as well but by the end of the 40 year old virgin i think i found overall it was more satisfying than <UNK> although one can guess where the relationship story with steve <UNK> character andy and catherine <UNK> character <UNK> will go to it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with <UNK> and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic more rounded than most of the one dimensional or unexplained people in the other and perhaps it may also depend on how much you identify or just find the <UNK> in both br br the thing is some people may go into the 40 year old virgin not knowing steve <UNK> as well as owen wilson or vince vaughn as <UNK> has built up his cult status on the daily show one of my favorite shows on now and in small but <UNK> <UNK> roles in anchorman and bruce almighty this is his first starring role but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle he and co writer director judd <UNK> treat the character of andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way even early on as he talks to his action figures while re painting them it's also a <UNK> line to walk on in <UNK> hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the lackluster 40 days and 40 nights with josh <UNK> also about sexual <UNK> as the title suggests andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little pee wee herman in him the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious a good sign br br so his friends among them paul rudd <UNK> <UNK> seth <UNK> all very good comic <UNK> try and <UNK> different <UNK> and <UNK> to finally break the sort of curse over <UNK> head to pop his <UNK> so to speak he almost gets with a overly drunk woman he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl and almost with his own boss jane lynch also very funny in the <UNK> as a <UNK> buddy but this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with <UNK> who works across the street from him as they build on a relationship not based at all on sex one might worry that the plot gear of how is he going to tell her such and such might get in the way of the comedy it doesn't in fact if anything <UNK> and the cast build on it to a very high degree for practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length there was barely a moment i wasn't laughing whether big or small br br the big laughs though make up for not just any kind of <UNK> with the plot or one or two little stray stories the fellow co workers have their own relationship problems as well <UNK> being the funniest the big laughs come through because of <UNK> reactions and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor charm or that its with some truth <UNK> gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship and un like <UNK> there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise for someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face <UNK> gets very high points here and like with a <UNK> brothers movie the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity the <UNK> scene which was done for real by the way and the sort of <UNK> musical number towards the very end of the film the way it comes out at first is a total <UNK> surprise but if you're willing not to get offended by it there's more where that came from this is one of the funniest films of the year
<START> seven pounds stars will smith as ben thomas an irs collection agent who has an <UNK> motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax <UNK> thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and <UNK> for his quite frankly unforgivable crime br br the story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window what you see is exactly what is happening even the ending of titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds there is absolutely no twist whatsoever there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening br br normally i only like will smith when is in full bad boys mode the guy is at his best when sporting a gun driving a ford <UNK> and saying <UNK> hell <UNK> as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for this is probably the main reason why i wasn't looking forward to the movie although here he is very understated there are flashes of comedy but they are subtle in fact it was the most understated will smith performance i have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award br br the supporting cast were all grand too rosario dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and woody <UNK> and barry pepper were fine as where all the other bit players br br overall it is a <UNK> but it isn't throwing all the usual clichés and sentimental <UNK> to give you no other choice but to cry there were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke you will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real br br i would give it 8 10 the will smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of the pursuit of happiness and comes of all the better for it
<START> i had numerous problems with this film br br it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum <UNK> which is fine although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years the film presents this information in a <UNK> way that seems to be saying aren't you just blown away by this well not really these aren't earth shattering revelations anymore at any rate i was already familiar with quantum theory and the fact that <UNK> have to be described by wave <UNK> etc is not new br br the main problem i have with this movie however is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for <UNK> and <UNK> i don't have any serious problem with <UNK> and <UNK> but quantum <UNK> doesn't really have anything to do with these things and it should be kept separate the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better the reasoning is completely ridiculous and the conclusions do not <UNK> follow from quantum theory for every so called expert that they interviewed for this film there are scores of <UNK> <UNK> who would completely disagree they would point out quite rightly that the <UNK> of the <UNK> world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual <UNK> br br it <UNK> me that people are going to see this film and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling the main thrust of the film is based on a total <UNK> of quantum theory and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo scientific arguments br br avoid this film br br oh yeah at one point one of the experts says that since throughout history most of the <UNK> people have made about the world turned out to be false therefore the <UNK> we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false huh that totally does not follow and even if it did i don't see how that helps his argument i mean if his ideas ever became common <UNK> then i guess we would have to assume that they are false too based on his own reasoning
<START> that's right the movie is better than the book don't get me wrong i love the book but the movie is just so much better this film has jack nicholson and <UNK> duvall at their best i haven't seen <UNK> <UNK> and obviously danny lloyd in anything else some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book but i already talked about those in my comment on the mini series but i missed a few the film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot and the <UNK> scenes are <UNK> than those in the book so if you're looking for a great movie get stanley kubrick's the shining but count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks
<START> worst <UNK> i have seen ever well maybe not as bad as smart house this was just bad the acting and story was fine but the effects sucked br br they were so fake the only good fight scene was between the brother and <UNK> that was probably the only scene in which i was excited br br overall i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly br br i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene br br 4 10
<START> in short this movie is completely worthless br br the idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early <UNK> might think of the future an interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters <UNK> us from ever <UNK> our disbelief so the idea just <UNK> br br apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed but as a graphics person the over <UNK> was an obvious <UNK> for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening the color is <UNK> washed out to no relevant effect except <UNK> the visual quality and i don't understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking if anything the ridiculous <UNK> graphics have <UNK> the bar for really bad graphics they don't measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics the models for the robots were so simple plain and very <UNK> there were a bunch of weirdo <UNK> like animals on that island but they are not explained in any way br br the story is horrible beyond belief in fact i can't believe i didn't just walk out of this movie the relationship between polly and joe is <UNK> and throughout the movie is based on <UNK> and deception why is the morris <UNK> character even there we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic i mean he flies a plane and saved one person polly for personal reasons yeah there's a great hero for you <UNK> has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him who were the <UNK> that locked joe and polly in the mine vault and why would they do it remembering that the entire <UNK> operation was robotic br br plot holes 1 why did <UNK> <UNK> character a major fall from her excellent character in the crow halt the robots who had captured joe they were looking for the <UNK> and had not found them 2 why in the hell would <UNK> be captured but not killed he doesn't have or know about the <UNK> and the bad guys didn't know that polly had the <UNK> and was connected to joe and therefore to <UNK> 3 polly <UNK> that they don't know anything about <UNK> yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbi style file on him 4 the blank spot on the map as described by the <UNK> if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot 5 at one point polly and joe have to give up their clothes they are burned joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking <UNK> dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes back br br sigh how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap br br we are supposed to be <UNK> by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely <UNK> is happening on screen br br and the acting we're supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents which character isn't annoying i think <UNK> <UNK> dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie she doesn't have a single line the dialogue wasn't camp and doesn't even rise to the level of cheese its just bad and annoying these people aren't hero's or compelling they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or <UNK> with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life br br i can't believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb imho it should be competing with batman forever in the bottom 100 of all time
<START> i love the satan pit david <UNK> is such a great actor and so is <UNK> <UNK> who else loves will <UNK> to pieces he is so cute isn't he i hated the bits where he got possessed by the devil and where he got told to go to hell as rose so <UNK> put it mind you he was quite funny when he said rose do us a favour will you shut up mr <UNK> was so brave wasn't he dying to save the others i felt really sorry for toby will <UNK> when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared i was like oh my god if i was rose i'd be so scared for him and when she <UNK> him i was like <UNK> he's mine hands off but i thought that was really sweet and the doctor well i thought he was gonna say to <UNK> tell rose i love her but he didn't oh well
<START> if you have seen very less films this might be a big one for you if you have seen lot of films this is a joke the acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly not to mention there are songs there are lot of flashbacks and most importantly the fighting scenes are <UNK> performed new characters good direction would have done a better job but since it contains all the bollywood <UNK> <UNK> you can predict whats going to happen next you do not feel sad when something happens the emotions they <UNK> is terrible mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies it suppose to be a realistic movie but it fails to show there are times you wondering you have thousands of army <UNK> filled with soldiers moving and the <UNK> are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them are the <UNK> really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid there were only a few characters acting that was very good but as far it is concerned with plot action it is poorly directed this movie could have been short if they took out songs flashbacks stick to the point
<START> cia <UNK> <UNK> is an absolute horrible rip off of luc <UNK> classic film la femme <UNK> 1990 the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them pretty much the same story structure of la femme <UNK> the acting <UNK> of <UNK> lamas and o j simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history <UNK> acting is simply a bad steven segal <UNK> watching <UNK> act in this film is an excruciating experience br br the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable there are so many action movie conventions in the film it is ridiculous unnecessary car explosions people flying thru glass windows terrorists bad <UNK> etc the musical score resembles david michael <UNK> score for hard to kill 1990 which <UNK> the steven segal theme of this movie there is plenty of martial arts in the film and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up and i have to admit i was mildly entertained br br <UNK> lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90's but he is certainly no action star that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters my recommendation is that you skip cia <UNK> <UNK> and check out la femme <UNK> instead
<START> this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse br br the jungle music <UNK> demons and <UNK> <UNK> style blood teeth eyes give it that awful look and the script is dire this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it it's also predictable but not in a good way nothing this film does is in a good way i watched it 10 minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are oh and the acting doesn't let the film down it's also terrible
<START> ludicrous <UNK> of the most basic security <UNK> are only the beginning it's hard to see how they achieved such abysmal trash on such a low budget i turned it off once then got curious to see if it could get any worse it did
<START> the opening shot was the best thing about this movie because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate well crafted independent film damn that opening shot for filling me hope as the film progressed in a slow plodding manner my thoughts were varied in relation to this film was there too much <UNK> in my popcorn did the actors have to pay the director to be in this film did i get my ticket <UNK> at the box office yes dear reader i saw this film in the theatre this would be the only exception i will make about seeing a film at home over a movie theatre because at home you can turn it off were there any redeeming values peter <UNK> as the standard college nerd had his moments especially in a dog collar other than that this film went from trying to be a comedy to a family drama to a spiritual <UNK> it succeeded on none of these <UNK> oh and the girlfriend was <UNK> bad her performance was the only comedy i found
<START> i <UNK> the trip two years ago on the internet now i've seen the film what a ride and what a trip to finally get to know darius <UNK> such a courageous wise funny and talented spirit and what a crew to listen to darius laughing from being in the water at <UNK> city to see his <UNK> of being too close to <UNK> in <UNK> the wonder in his eyes as he <UNK> in a hot air balloon the excitement of <UNK> through some <UNK> the bet to eat a <UNK> of <UNK> and the phone calls home and as always boys will be boys this film needs to be seen by everyone young and old alike darius and his mother are models of strength and courage and the crew members are <UNK> to the heart of the younger generation they got darius a new wheelchair they documented <UNK> problems they took darius on the trip of his life and they touched many many lives by raising awareness of <UNK> and <UNK> funding for research this film will help accomplish the final goal of darius goes west a cure for <UNK>
<START> i have watched some pretty poor films in the past but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it br br i am a fan of most genres and enjoy shoot 'em up games but <UNK> the <UNK> scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable br br as most have already said there was hardly any script and the acting was weak i won't waste my time describing it br br anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or <UNK> or else they have a very <UNK> concept of entertainment br br i must say i was more annoyed with the video shop who gave this a thumbs up which led me to rent it thank god i had a second film to watch to <UNK> some of my faith in movies br br comic book guy would be right if he said worst movie ever
<START> bad at being intentionally bad br br this little gem shot straight onto the mst3k big screen while it's obvious the movie isn't trying to be taken seriously hopefully that their goal anyway the movie is still plain bad hell it makes <UNK> in space look big budgeted br br in short paint my muscle car <UNK> colored
<START> if the man in the white suit had been done in america can't you see either danny <UNK> or jerry lewis trying on alec <UNK> sidney <UNK> on for size br br this is one of the best of alec <UNK> films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out it's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new <UNK> government and the society it was trying to build it's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree br br alec guinness this meek little <UNK> of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can <UNK> clothing that will never need cleaning that in fact <UNK> all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the <UNK> br br he's a <UNK> <UNK> and he does succeed of course the <UNK> haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert <UNK> in oliver twist br br it's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i've mentioned can be played for laughs poor <UNK> suit is not only white and <UNK> <UNK> but it <UNK> like a <UNK> sign br br other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous <UNK> joan <UNK> as his <UNK> daughter and ernest <UNK> the biggest clothing <UNK> in the uk br br come to think of it did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever
<START> a great british <UNK> movie fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug <UNK> set pieces that cheech and chong would be proud of great to see phil daniels back on the big screen even if he has <UNK> sides since <UNK> and gary stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies loved the final fight scene with it's nod to <UNK> and now i know what happened to arthur brown after he set himself on fire on top of the pops he's not acting he really is a <UNK> <UNK> british hippie you don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's straight into my friday night post pub repeat viewing collection br br give this film a go and you won't be disappointed
<START> i think phillip kaufman read the <UNK> notes version of the <UNK> novel and then set about making this film okay of course it won't have the punch of the original <UNK> novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept his ability to step in and out of stories he <UNK> this film does not even try the one dream sequence of <UNK> so vital to the atmosphere of the book is <UNK> and makes no sense whatsoever also and this is perhaps a lesser point daniel day lewis looks a lot like ben stiller in this i know it's not really a valid complaint but hey a perfect example of the hollywood <UNK> of otherwise fine literature
<START> this anime was underrated and still is hardly the <UNK> kids movie as noted i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it one of the better movies released br br the animation while not perfect is good camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view it's a story to entertain not to question br br still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted <UNK> not to say its a childish movies there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all
<START> spoiler warning br br absolutely without a doubt one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen totally impossible to take any of this seriously it would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it during the glory days of her program carol <UNK> and company who often did take offs on films <UNK> this one in ways that were hard to imagine carol played jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight <UNK> and immediately the <UNK> music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from harvey <UNK> played oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked ryan <UNK> the only thing funnier than this bit is the real film br br what a death scene at the end jenny really looks like she's dying alright dying for her make up artist to come in and give her a little color and of course we all know how often <UNK> encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the <UNK> final moments the ending scene with ryan <UNK> sitting on a <UNK> in the snow <UNK> his future in the movie business is an instant classic he had plenty to worry about he never did recover from this
<START> ice age is not only animation of the year in my eyes it's also the best animated feature i've ever seen br br the <UNK> excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website <UNK> is cool and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes br br the animation is superb your heart really goes out to the characters in this film they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed it's hard to say which one really steals the picture br br i experienced their journey with laughter tears and <UNK> nothing was forced or over done the emotion was genuine especially in the dramatic second half the last film to affect me this deeply was <UNK> in 1997 also a fox production and before that it was the land before time 1988 all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience not just the <UNK> 10 10 br br
<START> i saw this movie with my rock climbing <UNK> and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity for one if stallone is out free climbing by himself there's no need to carry any gear but i guess those <UNK> <UNK> look sorta mountain <UNK> so let's throw them in for those <UNK> folks who think that <UNK> looks anything like the <UNK> in italy where the movie was filmed well the hollywood <UNK> have got a lot more ridiculous foul <UNK> stuff for you to swallow
<START> an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been <UNK> so no new story lines here however the authors managed to create a stupid disgusting film if you enjoy watching kids <UNK> or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife's teeth out in a bloody horror type go see or rent the film if not move on to something else my fair lady anyone
<START> friday the 13th step over there is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there i won this movie in a contest at college and it was a waste of money even if it was free jack jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something at least friday the <UNK> never bored me i'd rather have my <UNK> pulled than see this again
<START> i watched the movie while recovering from major surgery while i knew it was only a b film a space western i loved it it may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non the less held my imagination and provided great <UNK> sadly our society has so much available <UNK> small attempts is too easy in the same way that i can enjoy a even a grade school performance of shakespeare i can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake i am a cop and found <UNK> with the retired <UNK> dreams like his haunt me that i will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save <UNK> life or my own while it was a romantic ending where farnsworth did take out the bad guy predictable i needed a little happy romance where good can triumph my world is really too cynical
<START> this movie is basically about some girls in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red <UNK> in one in one of their school mates <UNK> and after being <UNK> for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on the girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved she becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened the other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell the deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their <UNK> that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just can't put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that the best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene i admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind this movie reminds me of the low budget thriller blood song with frankie <UNK> staring in it the same motive just a different character part it's not a movie worth renting not even for an 80's low budget movie and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back
<START> the good earth is a great movie everybody must see it is tear <UNK> and very heart warming it <UNK> to the <UNK> of values <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> and the love of family the story can be related to our life today especially that poverty is at the <UNK> the way on how we respond to such problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to face such he may be left <UNK> and useless i am very pleased on how the characters justified their roles even the young actors their emotions has captivated the audience the movie may have been done in black and white but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end that makes it really great there should be a re make for this very nice movie
<START> <UNK> ho is one of those movies that i never get tired of watching michael keaton has always been a favorite of mine he is absolutely hilarious in this movie matching him step for step is <UNK> <UNK> the two of them work wonderfully together although this movie is a comedy i also like how it shows hunt keaton <UNK> <UNK> struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups they both try so hard to keep the peace then they finally get into a fight which is hysterical to watch first they're both on the floor then hunt jumps on a chair <UNK> jumps on the desk hunt jumps on the desk with him the fight then <UNK> out from the office into the factory i love that after they are separated by the workers you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand also there is a scene where you can see the influence that hunt has had on <UNK> he is at his house his boss from japan arrives says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow br br <UNK> tomorrow not good day <UNK> why not <UNK> factory is locked we can't find key br br tell me you can't picture michael keaton saying something like that br br i guess i really like this movie because it is genuinely funny also shows how people that are <UNK> different can not only learn from each other but become good friends as well
<START> i was expecting a very funny movie instead i got a movie with a few funny jokes and many that just didn't work i didn't like the idea of bringing in sherlock <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> it was confusing it would have been more funny if they just had someone new instead of <UNK> <UNK> some of the things were funny burt <UNK> was very funny as always <UNK> on the horse was funny the <UNK> from hawaii 5 0 was not even <UNK> like connie booth obviously is very good with accents she is from indiana but played english and a new <UNK> pretty well unfortunately she was not presented much into the script i was expecting a more funny film instead i got a rather confusing movie with a poor script rather ironic since both booth and <UNK> were together on this one maybe they were about to break up in <UNK>
<START> as it is generally known anthology films don't fare very well with american audiences i guess they prefer one standard plot line new york i love you is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities the people who live love in them the first was <UNK> <UNK> which i really enjoyed the film was made up of several segments each written and or directed by a different director most of which were french but there is a very funny segment directed by joel ethan <UNK> like <UNK> this one is also an anthology directed by several different directors <UNK> akin mira <UNK> natalie portman <UNK> <UNK> etc and also like <UNK> with new <UNK> and why they love the city they live in it features a top notch cast featuring the likes of natalie portman <UNK> <UNK> christina <UNK> orlando bloom ethan <UNK> and also features such seasoned veterans as james <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eli <UNK> and julie christie some of the stories really fly and others don't although i suppose it will depend on individual tastes i won't ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me which ones didn't word is that the next entry in the series will be shanghai china is rome italy berlin germany or <UNK> <UNK> out of the question spoken mainly in english but does have bits of <UNK> russian with english subtitles rated <UNK> the mpaa for strong language sexual content
<START> hi i'm a friend of werewolf movies and when i saw the title of <UNK> hitting the shelves i was like hmm simple and nice name to it at least <UNK> i wonder why i haven't heard of it before br br first of all the movie starts with tits lots of tits tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to who cares about a werewolf effect just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots br br so about the mysterious <UNK> character a little spoilers ahead but who really cares he's your average everyday biker not even super tough looking but like the old wise woman says in the movie he is far more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before just by describing her a <UNK> biker type of a guy pretty original i even had look twice when they first used the red glowing eyes special effect i mean my god that lets plant red <UNK> on eyes with computer effect has been used since the seventies it looks plain ugly here and don't get me started with the werewolf 3d cgi as said before like an bad and old video game br br and finally as i do like werewolf films like i said they <UNK> always build a werewolf legend of their own <UNK> does build the <UNK> as well about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient <UNK> but it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement the <UNK> kills anyone the girl has touched starts random <UNK> which just doesn't make any sense why even bother telling us the rules of killing when they aren't even gonna play by them <UNK> the wolf point of view shots are made with a <UNK> <UNK> or something filming mostly the floor and walls just add <UNK> noises and you've got a super werewolf effect the gore is partially ok but when the wolf <UNK> everyone with an open hand just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims it just doesn't do the trick for me br br truly who gives money to make these <UNK> of junk straight to video <UNK> they aren't even funny kind of bad movies just sad
<START> i must confess to not having read the original m r james story although i have read many of his other supernatural tales i've also seen most of the previous bbc christmas ghost stories and this one in my opinion surpasses most of them only <UNK> the <UNK> br br i can't really fault a view from a hill the direction and <UNK> is perfect as is the acting lighting and of course the story and writing i thoroughly enjoyed this and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team i understand that the bbc plan to make some more not necessarily based on m r james stories so that's promising br br 10 10
<START> <UNK> at the door <UNK> how i miss this show so bad but we are lucky to now have invasion thank you shawn cassidy american gothic had it all if i had to pick one thing that i liked best about the show it has to be its not predictable plot lines favorite actor was lucas black i adore that southern accent i bought the dvd <UNK> and my kids are fans too there is some hot n steamy scenes some <UNK> ones too so if <UNK> will be watching you may want to edit <UNK> skip it has humour on a <UNK> <UNK> level which so many shows lack adult wit and adult situation that are handled with <UNK> the dvd has some extras but i wish it has many more if you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show come watch american gothic
<START> when thinking about <UNK> many words come to mind among them are uninteresting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and unwatchable br br i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically <UNK> of scream but these new saw <UNK> are beginning to make those films look like classics they still <UNK> to the same <UNK> that those other movies were so successful at doing but now they add a new level of <UNK> that make the twelve to <UNK> year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore and hip br br this movie is a load of boring crap what the hell has happened to larry cohen his name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993 even so i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the <UNK> did anyone not know it when they first saw him only someone who has never before in his or her life ever seen another movie
<START> this film is underrated i loved it it was truly sweet and heartfelt a family who struggles but isn't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today the film didn't make it an issue that they have little money or are <UNK> <UNK> the way hollywood have br br instead the issue is victor is immature and needs to grow up he does slowly by the film's end he has a ways to go but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward his grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time a truly heartfelt indie
<START> go <UNK> go you are the proof that <UNK> films may should and must be different there's soul in it and this is rare don't let anybody put you down
<START> one thing i always liked about robert <UNK> thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out it goes in a completely different direction there are so many twists and turns in this film that i have a sore neck from watching br br one thing i also like about director john <UNK> kill me again <UNK> unforgettable is that he can be <UNK> upon to direct and in this case write with his brother rick a good story br br now add nick cage dennis hopper lara flynn boyle and j t walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have <UNK> <UNK> seems to bring out the best in folks and this will keep you interested and guessing until the very end
<START> early heavy war time propaganda short <UNK> people to be careful with their spending practices in effort to prevent any runaway <UNK> br br using scare guilt and patriotic <UNK> <UNK> which was normal for the time the government was concern that the sudden war time production and therefore <UNK> increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war br br it truly is a window into the past historically and <UNK>
<START> this film looked interesting i'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly br br started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations in fact i didn't bother watching the whole thing utter drivel bad performances bad acting and instantly <UNK> characters that was the point of the film i guess br br watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a <UNK> for the remainder of my weekend br br do not bother with this feature
<START> having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the <UNK> village broadway area i couldn't wait to see it's final copy br br viewing this film at the cleveland <UNK> last friday i haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the crippled safe <UNK> in this flick i was most <UNK> by william h macy as crook <UNK> and michael <UNK> as <UNK> they keep you in <UNK> i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie
<START> yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it tim meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the saturday night live show whenever he would do this character on the show i would crack up laughing so after i saw this was going to be playing on comedy central one night i decided to check it out all in all i was <UNK> impressed with this movie because it wasn't meant to win any oscars or become comedy of the year but it did entertain the saturday night live fans that love the ladies man character this movie is also packed with some highly <UNK> lines that can be <UNK> for years to come
<START> interesting film about an actual event that took place during the civil war in <UNK> it kept my attention to the end and i don't regret viewing it i haven't ever read any on this raid incident so i was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off i enjoy historical films from that era br br my major complaint is with the <UNK> uniforms they look too good the acting was a little stiff at times i like the old man eating the <UNK> <UNK> because he didn't have any teeth the wounded soldier playing <UNK> with a <UNK> was a little strange overall it was a descent film
<START> this is just as good as the original 101 if not better of course cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of cruella we see a lot more of her this time round i also like <UNK> <UNK> as kevin the rather bumbling male lead to use paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea the movie is well worth watching whatever your age provided you like animals
<START> this is a film that had a lot to live down to on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and i'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was <UNK> for being too complicated br br to be honest the plot is something of a red <UNK> and the film suffers even more when the word plot is used because as far as i can see there is no plot as such there's something involving russian gangsters a character called pete thompson who's trying to get his wife sarah pregnant and an irish bloke called sean how they all fit into something called a plot i'm not sure it's difficult to explain the plots of guy ritchie films but if you watch any of his films i'm sure we can all agree that they all <UNK> one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing likewise a james bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes you will have a serious problem believing <UNK> <UNK> has any type of central plot that can be <UNK> explained br br taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning <UNK> as to what sort of film you'll be watching <UNK> frost has appeared in some of the worst british films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent steven <UNK> gives acting a bad name and he plays a character called <UNK> which sums up the wit of this movie while one of the supporting characters is played by a tv <UNK> presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this br br the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable i saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching but by now i've mainly forgotten why but this doesn't alter the fact that i remember <UNK> this piece of crap immensely
<START> i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite george c scott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not give the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him br br this movie has the best tiny tim by far he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films anthony <UNK> still has all or most of his baby teeth br br david warner is wonderful as bob <UNK> he is such a versatile actor he portrays a man who clearly loves his family he plays the role with dignity neither as a <UNK> man <UNK> under <UNK> but as a man who <UNK> puts up with it because he has a family to provide for <UNK> york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life edward <UNK> is the best ghost of christmas present i've ever seen most often he is played as a jolly santa type character in this he shows anger at <UNK> attitudes and really makes scrooge <UNK> br br the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life a wonderful movie
<START> i may not have the longest of attention <UNK> but this is the second movie i have refused to see all the way through and i even bought it on dvd because of its classic status br br at first i thought that the director was playing a big joke so i kept waiting for a resolution something to laugh at something to keep my interest but this resolution never came rather the writing was laughably amateurish the movie dragged on and felt disjointed like someone cut a tv series to feature length the academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight oscars br br once again i repeat myself this is the second movie i have refused to watch all the way through the first was <UNK> i hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is 1 10
<START> eddie izzard is a one in a million comic genius he goes from <UNK> to wwii to <UNK> to religion to <UNK> <UNK> and it's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense get a copy of this now you won't regret it i give this an 11 out of 10
<START> grand central murder 1942 <UNK> s <UNK> simon br br production mgm br br this mediocre <UNK> mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with simon as director surely he could have fit another red <UNK> film or two on his schedule anyway grand central murder is a shameless rip off of the thin man films minus the wit charm and chemistry of the leads we are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support its 73 minutes bad acting and weary gags br br van <UNK> and virginia grey play nick and nora <UNK> er rocky and butch <UNK> he's a <UNK> and she's his wife and <UNK> partner they engage in humorous banter with each other see it's completely different already <UNK> the only one here who hints at bigger and better things although he's real close to being a jerk in this virginia grey was in another thin man but again let me stress this film is nothing like that one no sir and just in case we start to think that this film is absolutely nothing like another film say the thin man we actually like sam <UNK> pops up as the lead detective who's kind of dim and has to have van <UNK> subtly direct him toward all the important leads hmmm br br quickly the <UNK> is that of bitchy <UNK> <UNK> king who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even <UNK> one she's played by patricia <UNK> who's like a c version of hedy <UNK> until she opens her mouth and turns into an f there's a whole array of wacky suspects all with their own motivation for wanting <UNK> dead there's the society type the tough talking <UNK> the thug the ex lover and a shady theater <UNK> tom <UNK> here <UNK> with the unlikely character name of <UNK> <UNK> roman <UNK> plays a nervous <UNK> type something i believe he may have done before <UNK> mitchell plays an idiot cop who in a running gag that won't quit can't stop thinking about the piece of ass he's got waiting for him once this case gets wrapped up that's right <UNK> mitchell <UNK> finally in a completely ground breaking method of storytelling something we've never seen before all the suspects are gathered up in one place where they tell their stories as flashbacks to the detective as rocky takes mental notes until eventually the guilty person is compelled to dramatically <UNK> out a confession br br on top of the actual picture being a dud i <UNK> thought going in that there might be a couple of location shots of the actual 1942 era grand central but alas no there's merely one very brief shot at the beginning thanks for nothing grand central murder so to sum up a wee bit formulaic but <UNK> was okay br br <UNK> out of 4
<START> revenge of the <UNK> starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes with the same horrible dialogue and dull <UNK> that have plagued the rest of the prequel series the only thing that <UNK> the proceedings is the slow and i mean slow build up to what we know will be the birth of darth vader and when that finally comes it's pretty all right not great not even good but pretty all right this movie is being vastly over praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels instead it's just turgid dull and routine but you have to say wow those cgi <UNK> are really impressive at times <UNK> the <UNK> fights they're all a <UNK> mess i think the dark side took hold of lucas when he started these <UNK> and no one noticed this will make a ton of money but thank god it's over this once <UNK> franchise has been beaten down enough i saw the 12 <UNK> show and after it i heard a group of very small kids say wow that was awesome but everyone older than eight all <UNK> the same thing i fell asleep in the middle it was kind of boring i just thought seeing the birth of darth vader would be better so said we all
<START> sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i've seen in a long while <UNK> with amazing cg and special effects <UNK> with an a list cast jude law gwyneth paltrow angelina jolie and the infinitely likable <UNK> <UNK> and racing along with an <UNK> but indiana jones esquire storyline this should have been a great movie to watch br br <UNK> <UNK> being the key term here of course br br jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over the shoulder heart melting <UNK> but you can't make something out of nothing and even his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> good looks can't save the movie's stone dialogue if he had slapped <UNK> <UNK> on the back and said good boy <UNK> just one more time i might have <UNK> all over the guy in front of me gwyneth paltrow as polly <UNK> is nothing less than nerve grating her <UNK> whining and not quite sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30's comic book heroine who knows i expected more from her an example of how a similar character was played and played well is in the late 90's flick the phantom starring <UNK> <UNK> and billy zane rent the movie and you'll know what i mean br br <UNK> <UNK> and angelina jolie were the saving <UNK> in the film angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that <UNK> i'll admit it in just a few short scenes both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry two dimensional <UNK> br br the plot and steady story progression were old boring and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years the pace is rapid fire in the first half of the movie and a <UNK> pace in the second giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film but to figure out who the key villain is as well the pairing is rather clichéd also polly <UNK> and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of <UNK> from a <UNK> ended romance and their story isn't so much charming and <UNK> as it is annoying and <UNK> when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film <UNK> surprised and nobody really cares either br br props to the director for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> enough to dress her in <UNK> <UNK> for the entirety of the film and also for the intriguing <UNK> tones that served as <UNK> throughout but sky captain despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie falls flat on its face not even worth the 2 75 i paid to get into the theater
<START> going into this movie i had heard good things about it coming out of it i wasn't really amazed nor disappointed simon pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies there were a couple of laughs here and there nothing too funny probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene i totally gotta try that out next time i find myself in a club a couple of stars here and there including <UNK> fox kirsten dunst that chick from x files and jeff bridges i found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of <UNK> <UNK> in a scene she of course being in a previous movie with simon pegg run <UNK> run i see it as a toss up you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull i might add kirsten dunst is adorable in this movie 3
<START> atlantis is <UNK> the best disney movie that i have seen in years it has great action scene magic an intelligent and <UNK> written script atlantis brings back the magic of the disney classics such as the lion king or <UNK> after seeing this one i'm sure that this year summer blockbusters season will be great br br i recommend to you all <UNK> the lost empire is like a breath of inspiration br br 9 out of 10
<START> i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols and that is the reason i came watching this film br br the <UNK> of this film compared to other modern <UNK> is that it's not just about one page of a <UNK> history like i am trying to break your heart about <UNK> but rather covers long period of the <UNK> history in this movie director producer <UNK> <UNK> closely followed friends rivals the brian <UNK> massacre <UNK> and the dandy warhols <UNK> for more than 8 years 1995 2003 and shoot tremendous <UNK> hours of raw video cut than to 1 45 hours the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film the result is astonishing there are no <UNK> the film is 100 pure and genuine archive footage which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands through all these years br br both bands in the start of their careers promised to make a revolution in the music making and not to sell their souls to the devil of record industry however their paths quickly <UNK> the dandy warhols signed a contract with <UNK> records and became relatively popular especially in europe after only one album while the brian <UNK> massacre with its self destruction bound leader anton <UNK> <UNK> into oblivion at least how it is portrayed in the film and the movie follows the descent of the brian <UNK> massacre <UNK> by the <UNK> of the dandy warhols br br first i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton <UNK> for example <UNK> taylor the leader of the dandy warhols <UNK> but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film br br first it treats anton <UNK> as a disappeared person the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising <UNK> groups in which anton <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were equal partners that was the reason why all these years <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> access to the both bands it was anton <UNK> who brought the dandy warhols into the project in the end he was ignored completely as if he was kicked out of the project everybody talk about <UNK> but he does not take part in the discussion i guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process there are always both sides of the story and here we have only one of course as one would expect anton does not <UNK> the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends br br second the film is very dandy warhols biased sure the winner takes it all but the fact that <UNK> taylor leader of <UNK> <UNK> even though it seems a good choice it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement and that <UNK> late history is represented <UNK> <UNK> is covered till 1997 and <UNK> till 2003 does not add <UNK> to the film br br third the movie is somewhat shallow what does it want to teach us as one critic said movie <UNK> old questions where does genius fit into a <UNK> world can it <UNK> and get its due or does it need to self <UNK> to <UNK> its integrity no it does not examine these questions it just depicts a story of a brilliant but <UNK> musician narrated by a less brilliant but successful one who <UNK> in self <UNK> and eternal <UNK> of an ego greater than mountain br br anyway the movie was fun it's raw it's fresh it's stylish it's just god damn interesting at least for the <UNK> or <UNK> fans for the rest of the crowd i don't know
<START> i know that movies aren't necessarily supposed to mirror reality but this one got on my nerves it <UNK> ignorant stereotypes about psychological trauma and mental illness the psycho mom thing has been done too many times before and usually done better and much of the rest of the plot is far fetched as well the acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about br br one highlight i am a long time fan of general hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former <UNK> regular jon <UNK> br br anyway if you can overlook the bogus <UNK> part of it in the same way a person must suspend reality judgment when watching a lot of movies then this movie might be tolerable if you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards br br i'm sorry i spent my time watching it
<START> of course i was watching <UNK> i loved <UNK> i liked season 2 season 3 was ok and loved the final one <UNK> there is a spin off show i didn't know about this at all one of my friends told me about this i was really excited br br i watched the first 3 episodes what a piece of rubbish teenage girl drama fest there is no science fiction well hardly any at the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse of a <UNK> that's all who cares this did they decide that the next show's target audience will be females under 18 boring religious nonsense talking <UNK> <UNK> and some more br br it is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch stargate ruined <UNK> over
<START> i saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie the only thing i did see was quentin <UNK> seeming insane obsession for it there were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality overall however i found this movie <UNK> and ridiculous the hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks i found clumsy and <UNK> even sickening overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological <UNK> of the u s military against various <UNK> br br the various vignettes that made up the movie are <UNK> in their placement and <UNK> and <UNK> in their content and conclusions a depressing movie not a true film a term i <UNK> for true art that left me with a bad feeling do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a romantic comedy though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie <UNK> in content form and conclusion any association with this genre br br i suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of imdb and other ratings sources
<START> i don't understand how 2 of us receive such a high rating i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense followed by an <UNK> climax which was not worth the trouble however i did like jared <UNK> performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours
<START> it's not the most well made slasher movies of all time but for what it is it's pretty amusing the plot is lame but the kills are not too bad i have to be honest if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film you wont find this film as funny as those who do i knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour in between playing to <UNK> kids and <UNK> with friends <UNK> it's not made to be taken seriously it's <UNK> cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills most of which are ultra gory it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch drink and be merry
<START> geniuses william cameron <UNK> and herbert george wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film with ambition and scope hard to find today they predict world war ii and the way great britain was attacked and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race they change the timing in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer but there are so many <UNK> correct things that it's amazing we even see an helicopter the film is older than them br br unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic <UNK> of scientists that seem <UNK> with bubble <UNK> if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s <UNK> vision of a <UNK> society interesting <UNK> on the nature of power and john <UNK> as <UNK> of the adventurous and inventive human being the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it br br 9 1 2 out of 10 inspiring like that final monologue by john <UNK>
<START> i was so surprised by how great the man in the moon truly was i mean at first i was kinda expecting a cheesy and predictable film but i decided to put that aside when watching well when it was over i was just left stunned mainly in tears by how great the man in the moon turned out to be this movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone and its just a fabulous film the acting was great especially from <UNK> <UNK> who was so cute and lovable and everyone else there wasn't anything that really bothered me i felt the ending kinda predictable but very well done at that also i felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before but still a great film overall i must say i don't to much to say about this film not that it was bad its just a film you either like or don't like i would however recommend this to any and everyone even if you don't like these type of films its still an enjoyable film br br 8 7 out of 10 stars
<START> despite what others had said <UNK> this is my favourite movie of all time i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it but once i finally did i immediately fell in love sure it's strange but that just gives it more of an exciting <UNK> for those who don't know <UNK> is one of gackt and <UNK> first movies they haven't done very many at all maybe 3 or 4 tops each so give them some credit we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there but i over look that to find the best points of this movie the emotions displayed and <UNK> therefore i have given and always shall give this movie a 10 out of 10
<START> people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down <UNK> in post production i have harry as a professor right now at <UNK> and honestly its one of the best classes i've had its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated i originally watched joy of life for another class where harry did a voice over in the film and started watching this film after i started the class harry originally did some performance work and is really genuine about creating moments that move you especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment but its something you see in this film
<START> my interest in dorothy <UNK> caused me to purchase this video although it had great actors actresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest plus it just wasn't that interesting dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just <UNK> around too much to be believable i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey <UNK> last movies i'll always love john ritter best in slapstick he was just too pathetic here
<START> it seems like more consideration has gone into the imdb reviews of this film than went into the source br br here's a review without <UNK> br br just when you think nothing is going to happen it doesn't br br dress it up any way you like this is a dull film full of <UNK> characters doing very little of interest br br one to put on if you want to convince an <UNK> <UNK> chick that you're like so deep man br br not something to watch for your own pleasure though br br unless br br you're br br pretentious
<START> this is a trio of tales <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> about an experimental <UNK> or some such thing called the taylor <UNK> group which took people on <UNK> inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown and left a bit of damage here and there i'd say many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself <UNK> tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously in fact he was torn apart and the suspect was a man that may not have existed seems this woman is able to project some inner demon or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter <UNK> tells the tale of a young man who wants to jump out of his skin he's a <UNK> a speed freak and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this <UNK> which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire this is probably the best of the three segments <UNK> tells the tale of a <UNK> who attempts to <UNK> this woman who was a part of this <UNK> and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman but one wonders if he did it or if she <UNK> it because it could not survive in her any longer all three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the <UNK> this has a sort of low budget look and feel to it but it also manages to <UNK> up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout much to its credit i watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares and gore came it hit pretty hard i found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot a good little find this one i'd give it 8 out of 10
<START> w <UNK> <UNK> of human bondage is supposed to be a english language classic if so much must have been missing from the film version here <UNK> leslie howard attraction to mildred bette davis is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post <UNK> retelling of a relationship from the man's point of view being a family lawyer i've heard many such accounts the man depicts himself as noble and always correct and the woman is a <UNK> who has had no other objective than to exploit the man br br indeed unless one is willing to laugh at the social <UNK> of the film maker this is an uncomfortable movie to watch phillip even <UNK> mildred when she brings over a baby of <UNK> <UNK> but the real high point comes when phillip allows mildred <UNK> and now of dubious sanity the free run of his flat with predictable results bette davis was attractive for about five years of her life but that period didn't occur here in fact by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the baby jane character she would play thirty years later br br i note how <UNK> character is always <UNK> dressed and <UNK> it tells me that phillip <UNK> middle class <UNK> someone like that could not run from a woman with a course cockney accent fast enough phillip is for most of the movie a student such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger and had the <UNK> looks that <UNK> the low <UNK> and the low self <UNK> that often <UNK> student status an english <UNK> as it will and balanced that by allowing mildred a <UNK> of charm
<START> this movie had an interesting cast it <UNK> not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job im glad we have b grade movies like this one the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they <UNK> it you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a <UNK> to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station arnold <UNK> and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future
<START> a top <UNK> for worst film ever made joanna <UNK> character seems to have an i q of 3 which is only one less than the writer and director the screenplay would not have passed in a high school writing class the jokes are juvenile the concept corny these performers were obviously desperate for work i stayed to the end only to see if it would get worse it did life is too short to spend any part of it watching this film
<START> why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime conan is perhaps the only sword and <UNK> movie better the brutal violence cool character designs and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies around it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen this is not similar to bakshi's usual frenetic style it's quite a departure for bakshi and in my opinion his best work i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves
<START> i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one it deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldn't buy a copy for my friend br br it's a touching story about how people with eating <UNK> don't necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have <UNK> buddies it brought to my attention that although <UNK> can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of
<START> yet another forgettable <UNK> foreign intrigue thriller this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of lauren bacall who without <UNK> <UNK> tender <UNK> to <UNK> her comes off as her usual shrill shallow self even master <UNK> charles boyer cannot <UNK> romantic interest in her
<START> just saw this film and i must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film this was absolutely horrible but not in the sense that was intended i'm sure br br it was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would be viewers are morons or extremely hard up for entertainment or both thank god for fast forward i can't imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film i mean you have actors trying to be serious albeit barely and a script that cries for a total rewrite i just can't say anymore if <UNK> romance decided to do horror films this would be a good effort br br if you found this movie to be entertaining then i strongly suggest that you seek out some <UNK> as to the purpose of movies there is much better fare out there join a club read reviews but above all avoid crap like this
<START> for people interested in business and the corporate world this show is simply the best of the best as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his <UNK> about this innovative show people in business finally had an audience the whole idea is perfect having a group of <UNK> competing against each other in business related tasks set in the best place in the world new york city donald <UNK> is perfect as the boss even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times <UNK> he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire which is one of the <UNK> about the show br br season 1 great season overall the best season of the normal ones this season was the one that was most about actual business skills later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product <UNK> great and interesting contestants overall with the most likable character ever in this series <UNK> i know i'm not the only person who suspect that the <UNK> world tower episode where he got fired was <UNK> to have amy and nick win this particular task br br season 2 also a great season the tasks were still pretty much ok and it had many interesting contestants <UNK> m was terrible and should never had made it to the final imo also this season had the worst firing ever pamela br br season 3 terrible actually i liked the concept of book <UNK> vs street <UNK> but the cast was so utterly terrible it turned out that <UNK> hated the cast as well that the whole season was a total disaster best moments was the second episode motel <UNK> with <UNK> brian fired a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy value br br season 4 an excellent season much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season especially randall <UNK> marcus and the total disaster whose name was <UNK> the take me out to the <UNK> episode is one of the absolute classics of this show ending with the well remembered <UNK> firing sadly i think we got robbed for the randall vs <UNK> final i think <UNK> was afraid that she could have won and prevented that from happening br br season 5 a boring season with really no special things to it brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama the tasks were terrible overall how has creating a <UNK> anything to do with business at all i guess the best man won but personally i couldn't care less br br season 6 i can see why they wanted to try out l a as a new location for the show but looking back it was a mistake new york will always be the place for this this season added so many new things most of them terrible like losing team having to sleep outside in <UNK> winning <UNK> continues to be <UNK> for example the tasks were terrible and <UNK> also chose the wrong winner james deserved it no doubt br br season 7 celebrity edition best season ever totally different rules like the use of <UNK> but all fun and entertainment the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for <UNK> who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in this looked to be gene <UNK> season but after he made a complete fool of himself during the <UNK> task another man emerged from the shadows <UNK> morgan never has anyone dominated a season like he did he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor although some uptight americans not all americans of course don't take me wrong sadly didn't have the social skills to understand it way to go <UNK> br br for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss in fact the british version is way better and that says something since the american and original truly is a great show one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the <UNK> unlike the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version
<START> the quintessential <UNK> film of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1969 aka don't <UNK> is loosely based on the novel by french writer claude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> benjamin the novel takes place in the country side of the 18th century france the great french revolution is still ahead but some of its <UNK> signs are present in society benjamin the local doctor is a soul of a local society the educated friendly <UNK> person who often treats the poor for free it makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account he is in love with a beautiful <UNK> who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter his small capital and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed i never read the book and from description it sounds like a charming very french novel but i am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from 18th century france to the beginning of 20th century georgia <UNK> i would think that it was <UNK> who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native georgia <UNK> the land of long and wonderful traditions including art of making and drinking wine rare music talent that all <UNK> seem to possess very unique humor and high code of honor when we watched the film last night together with my husband he said what a great example of an art film and i so agree with him don't <UNK> is a perfect art movie visually beautiful deep but funny at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness full of interest loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters what is the most important the film is warm and gentle it does not look down at its viewers as some of the art pictures do you don't have to be a movie buff to love it to live with it to smile and sigh at it to follow the good hearted young doctor benjamin first role in a <UNK> film of famous singer and actor <UNK> <UNK> with whom <UNK> would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites <UNK> on his journey through the roads and mountains of georgia or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor <UNK> who wanted to be a guest on his own wake to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin when i watched the film i thought that it is a sort of movie that <UNK> fellini might have liked i was not surprised at all to find the article about <UNK> where he names fellini his number one director i also found out that according <UNK> the famous soviet directors <UNK> <UNK> the creator of many beloved comedies and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> whom i don't have to introduce loved another <UNK> film fairy tale about american boy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> felt and spoke <UNK> about don't <UNK> while fellini praised it highly i dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps <UNK> fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of don't <UNK> when he was making <UNK> in 1973 just a thought because there is something essential that <UNK> both films both artists came back to their roots to the places that they love deeply to the people they remembered loved and wanted to honor both films have a lot of smiles through the tears both are art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers both are <UNK> br br i think i am going to add <UNK> <UNK> to the list of my favorite directors he has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of <UNK> even <UNK> that are funny and bitter sweet poignant and subtle <UNK> and uplifting gentle and shining when i looked up the list of the movies he has written directed i was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in 1960 with the award winning story of a young boy <UNK> many of <UNK> films are among my favorites as i am sure they are among his <UNK> of fans the man behind <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1972 which is an adaptation of mark <UNK> the adventures of <UNK> <UNK> 33 ya <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1964 aka walking the streets of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1969 aka don't <UNK> <UNK> 1975 <UNK> 1977 <UNK> <UNK> 1979 aka <UNK> marathon or sad comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that <UNK> practically invented and the cult favorite for over 20 years <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1986 is brilliant and deserves our true love and genuine <UNK> for the unforgettable moments of cinematic happiness
<START> there's about 25 years worth of inspiration packed into it beginning with existential themes of blade runner as well as the vision of the future with corporate <UNK> advertising their products to the technology of the later matrix films and spielberg's a i and finally the black and white graphic novel look similar in style of sin city the creators have put in a lot of effort in the visual department and the outcome is a well crafted future neo noir add a detective story and you've got an interesting film i know what it wanted to be but regardless of the stunning visuals it wasn't enough to get it to the final destination
<START> <UNK> vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch br br observation in film it isn't necessary that source material be in <UNK> with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile small morality storytelling is quaint or <UNK> only in the eye of the <UNK> thankfully story content well told can overcome it's time subject or place br br ironically there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge <UNK> of the present era <UNK> small morality content occasionally might provide a dimension lacking
<START> how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life <UNK> it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were hoping maybe even <UNK> it wouldn't br br <UNK> this is the film's greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on you br br i saw this in a film theory class at <UNK> back in the mid <UNK> it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
<START> i watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers even the cover of the dvd looked good as soon as i started watching it i was thinking like others oh my god whats this there were some moments that were a bit creepy but then the mood was ruined by stupid music there was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes that right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn i wasted money again on a rental and was <UNK> by the cover art nothing against the music itself it was just in the wrong parts of the movie whoever edited the film has no clue what they are doing the cover showed lightning <UNK> they were caught in a storm at sea that would have been more interesting but it didn't happen the acting wasn't the worst i've ever seen considering they are all unknown and this is obvious their first film another reason i was disappointed was the plot made no sense in the beginning 2 men saw all of the teens get on a boat then at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts i'm not sure because it was very badly portrayed <UNK> who wrote a comment on here claims this is a true story he or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area this movie was filmed there was no mention in this movie about it being a true story i have never experienced something like that personally but am not saying it's impossible i guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie do it at your own risk if you like amateur student horror films you may like this
<START> i must have been only 11 when mr <UNK> started it was a must see for the whole family i believe on sun nights repeating gags were rob opening his locker he had to use a <UNK> or <UNK> to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things finally kicking the spot <UNK> his door would open and taking <UNK> out of a new shirt at the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when <UNK> the shirt timing was everything and the <UNK> got lots of laughs i remember an aunt that drove a <UNK> like jack benny and always wanted sonny to say something scientific he would think and come up with semi <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> causing her to say how brilliant he was you had to have been there marion <UNK> stole the show every time she was on screen why they didn't continue the series from her <UNK> when <UNK> quit he was afraid he was being <UNK> but by then it was way too late i'll never know i saw somewhere that the 1st tv wedding big one anyway was tiny tim on the carson show <UNK> it was rob and nancy did i ever have the <UNK> for her and i remember it made the cover of tv guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines a trip to the museum of <UNK> in nyc years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older
<START> holy crap this movie was bad i watched it just as a joke it isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way this film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry it worked really well at doing that it's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie priest added in a bunch of ugly <UNK> took out anything interesting funny or even remotely sexy and clever out of the <UNK> and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese that's all this is cheese there isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to there isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film or even a b movie now that i think of it what they hell were they trying to do with this film i watched it expecting a campy love story and instead i got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying christian brother tried to destroy it all no i'm not joking that's what it's about does that sound good this film is pretty ignorant against people of the <UNK> religion with it's stereotyping of all christians being <UNK> rude and <UNK> on making as many people as miserable as possible a lot of christian people i know would never speak or act like these freaks the film however is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well these have got to be the most <UNK> crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that <UNK> video game it's so nerve <UNK> and simply irritating to the point that i wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film the makers of this train wreck had no <UNK> for set design acting camera angles lighting script authenticity or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting there isn't even a single sex scene or at least not a believable one jamie brett <UNK> was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all but his good looks were sadly put to waste this is trash in a perfect world this film would get voted a 0 0 it's worth 0 as a film alone a mentally handicapped nun who is blind deaf and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her <UNK> could write direct and produce a better film and she'd probably be a better actor as well the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself this film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format i could put a <UNK> in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x <UNK> tree and then record that and i've already made a film that will always be better than ben arthur by at least half there are only two things worse than death torture and watching ben arthur i'm a homosexual and i will probably be the <UNK> person you will ever meet if you ever met me and i don't think i've ever been more offended by an entire film than i was by the first five seconds of this film alone if this movie was a mistake i will personally find a way to change the famous phrase it's okay to make mistakes to it's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was ben arthur you know how people always say things like good things come out of everything i think that ben arthur was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of to call this movie the worst movie i've ever seen would be giving it way too much credit it's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own there are good movies there are bad movies and then there's ben arthur this is ben and arthur
<START> i am very <UNK> correct guy so when i say sexist i really mean it reduced the female guest lead dr miranda jones played by diana <UNK> in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self control to nothing more inside but a big jealous <UNK> baby you <UNK> got the plot by now after her technical sidekick <UNK> also a <UNK> lover <UNK> out when he tried to kill the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out of a jealous rage but <UNK> first it instead you think he could have just walked in to the room with his eyes shut and <UNK> the box too easy he takes the enterprise into un <UNK> space outside the galaxy before the boys could <UNK> him well the ship is stuck in <UNK> at that point they could have gone to the good lady doctor <UNK> and discussed it spock has to make a mind <UNK> with the <UNK> so we can get home i mean like <UNK> do you want to stay <UNK> until we run out of supplies and die but the lady in true star trek fashion is a jealous monsters who <UNK> and <UNK> when the idea is <UNK> even when her <UNK> idol told her to shut up go along with them so the <UNK> out of spite <UNK> with the <UNK> spock causing him to forget to put on his <UNK> which makes spock go insane kirk naturally figured out what a total <UNK> she was and <UNK> her into <UNK> spock up with her superior <UNK> powers of course at the end the lady and <UNK> leave and all is forgiven you almost wish the president from battle star galactica showed up to <UNK> the witch out of an <UNK> for her destructive stunt but in star trek land ladies are <UNK> to be totally <UNK> and cruel yet at the same time supposedly there is sexual <UNK> this is what i mean by sexist
<START> my wife and i just finished watching <UNK> aka the booth she fell asleep during some parts of the movie i really wish i had taken a <UNK> with her but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep when our protagonist speaks it makes me want to hear <UNK> <UNK> and william shatner sing <UNK> he also has no redeeming qualities i was hoping he'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film br br don't get me wrong i love asian horror cinema but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all if you want some good asian cinema check out a tale of two sisters or into the mirror avoid the booth like the plague especially if you suffer from frequent <UNK>
<START> the premise of an african american female scrooge in the modern struggling city was inspired but nothing else in this film is here ms scrooge is a <UNK> <UNK> who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it <UNK> there is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved part of the problem is that story's roots don't translate well into the urban setting of this film and the script fails to make the update work also the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end this is a message film that doesn't know when to quit in the title role the talented <UNK> <UNK> gives an overly uptight performance and at times lines are difficult to understand the charles dickens novel has been adapted so many times it's a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant in spite of its very relevant message

<START> i have been searching for the right words to describe this film at first i was inclined to simply skip to more significant matters as the film does not rise to a level deserving comment br br yet i stopped puzzled as to how to describe such stuff and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question what can one say about such a film rubbish no its not rubbish rubbish can be recycled into something useful <UNK> gas no its not <UNK> gas <UNK> <UNK> help plants grow large and healthy br br finally i struck on not even bad a <UNK> of the phrase not even wrong used sometimes in <UNK> physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of <UNK> that's it then georgia rule not even bad
<START> <UNK> i know you're <UNK> with excitement well the secret lives of <UNK> will not upset your expectations it's <UNK> made but essentially unimaginative truthful but dull it concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be <UNK> and who share the same practice already a recipe for trouble if it wasn't for our separate work lives we'd all <UNK> our <UNK> out of sheer <UNK> campbell scott whose mustache and demeanor don't recall <UNK> so much as ned <UNK> from the simpsons is the mild mannered uber dad husband and hope davis is the bored stiff housewife who channels her <UNK> into amateur opera one night as dad the daughters attend one of <UNK> performances he discovers that his wife is <UNK> her <UNK> into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and <UNK> with the director of opera one nice touch we never see the opera director's face <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> the proceedings for <UNK> divorce and custody <UNK> <UNK> only to the lawyers scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife's <UNK> br br already the <UNK> among you are starting to yawn ho hum another story about the pathetic <UNK> little <UNK> but <UNK> who took the story from a jane <UNK> <UNK> hopes that the <UNK> <UNK> of the material will be <UNK> for by a series of flashy <UNK> touches for instance one of scott's <UNK> patients denis <UNK> kept relatively and <UNK> in check will later become a sort of construction of the <UNK> imagination <UNK> as a devil on the shoulder <UNK> for the old fashioned <UNK> virtues dump the b h etc when not <UNK> on by his imaginary new buddy scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a three way with two of the male dental <UNK> who work in their practice it's not going too far to say that this movie is eyes wide shut for real people or grown ups at least along those lines campbell scott and hope davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the <UNK> pair of cruise and kidman further the script for secret lives is clearly more relevant than kubrick's as proof i offer the depiction of the <UNK> children particularly the youngest one who is about 3 or 4 years old and whose main <UNK> is dad dad dad dad dad dad this is family life all right with all its charms br br the movie would make an interesting double bill with kramer vs kramer as well one can easily trace the <UNK> of the american male from 1979 to 2003 in this movie dad is the housewife as in kramer but he is in no way <UNK> by the domestic role unlike dustin hoffman who was too <UNK> to make <UNK> here scott gets all the <UNK> <UNK> such as <UNK> up the children's vomit cooking cleaning taking the kids to whatever inane after school activity is on the <UNK> and all without complaint and without directorial commentary it's just taken for granted br br the film has virtues mostly having to do with <UNK> however it's dragged down from greatness by its <UNK> on trendy <UNK> which <UNK> in a long scene where a horrible five day stomach <UNK> makes the rounds in the household we must endure pointless fantasy sequences <UNK> by the imaginary <UNK> <UNK> whose existence by the way is finally reminiscent of the brad pitt character in fight club and this finally drives home the film's other big flaw lack of originality in this review i realize it's been far too easy to reference many other films granted this film is an improvement on most of them but still the secret lives of <UNK> is worth seeing but don't get too excited about it not that you were all that excited anyway i guess
<START> ghost of <UNK> hollow is a typical 1950's teens in turmoil movie it is not a horror or science fiction movie plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their hot rod club because they cannot meet the rent once kicked out they decide to try an old haunted house the only saving grace for the film is that the ghost paul <UNK> in the she creature suit turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by <UNK>
<START> this film is described as a action comedy the first 15 minutes and james <UNK> presence point to it being a humorous gangster film br br however the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins a number of ludicrous plot twists which do little to <UNK> the contrived ending the film moves between comedy description used loosely and surreal drama with some out of context adult scenes thrown in the lead female the angel of the title is poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the script which requires some unbelievable extremes of character to be portrayed james belushi is the only one who handles his part well but is also let down by the poor script one to avoid
<START> this movie is a very relaxed romantic comedy which is thoroughly enjoyable meg ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of albert einstein though she does believe in her own skills tim robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car <UNK> up i loved walter matthau as the one and only albert einstein this movie just has a very relaxing feel to it while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it if that is actually possible it happens here br br i personally found this movie extremely entertaining especially the old scientists i thought they were <UNK> and hilarious this movie seems to have been <UNK> beyond <UNK> if you have a <UNK> sense of humour this is the movie for you
<START> i saw most of the episodes of <UNK> as a teenager on cliffhanger theater running after midnight on a local station some years ago and then again when mystery science theatre <UNK> on it in the early 90's time has not been kind to it br br i can certainly make <UNK> for the special effects which were quite impressive for a low budget 50's serial imo <UNK> <UNK> flying scenes were better than george reeves <UNK> in his tv show and i can also make <UNK> for the <UNK> acting and fight choreography except for the guy who plays the <UNK> of the moon men he is incredibly miscast he looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your <UNK> not the <UNK> <UNK> of an alien race even the corny dialog works all right everyone <UNK> off their lines like strings of <UNK> with no wasted time or pauses for things like thought or <UNK> since everyone does this the viewer finds it <UNK> after awhile and even to my modern sensibilities it doesn't bother much br br what really <UNK> me is the writing and the plotting i'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon or <UNK> <UNK> powered rocket ships or a flying suit that has controls labeled up down and fast slow i'm not even bothered by the cheesiness of the <UNK> to the <UNK> that end each chapter i'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence <UNK> and have no <UNK> memory and by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train the plot goes through the same motions again and again br br dig it <UNK> cody and his pal are the <UNK> of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting earth or at least the usa against an <UNK> alien invasion but his office has no guards or security <UNK> they don't even have locks on the front doors so the bad guys walk right in and beat the crap out of the cody and his staff not once perhaps understandable but several times they even kidnap his female assistant on the second try and they never get any smarter to further prove my point allow me to point out the way that cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone he does this over and over and over cody also flies his ship to the moon the woman assistant comes along to cook stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back cody captures one of the atomic ray guns and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he couldn't be bothered to lock it up and so on br br and you would think that if <UNK> efforts were so vital to saving the usa from the moon men that he might ask for a few soldiers with <UNK> a few <UNK> and a tank or two to back him up instead of just working with the local police all the time this was supposed to be a military operation but they act like it's another episode of <UNK> br br it's all rather hard to stomach i appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints and i appreciate that cody is actually a reasonably tough <UNK> even though he loses half of his <UNK> but i just can't help yelling door lock the <UNK> when the gangsters simply walk into his lab or try to blow up the ship and there are no security <UNK> at the landing site in place not even a fence br br still it's ok of the three republic serials i've watched phantom creeps had a better plot and <UNK> kingdom had more atmosphere <UNK> and a better hero than radar men but it's an ok time <UNK> br br btw why radar men they didn't use radar they used atomic ray guns shouldn't the title have been atomic ray gun men from the moon
<START> when an <UNK> manager goes on vacation his father takes over the details of the center and winds up renting the kids when a well off got it made couple with a nice apartment and great life get the notion to adopt this idea was <UNK> made for them why would they want to spoil their elegant existence with a trio of <UNK> carpet <UNK> no way would people like these two need kids to make life wonderful this movie makes it look like the real world works this way but i am the picture of <UNK>
<START> there's a good movie lurking here but this isn't it the basic idea is good to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse but the logic is so muddled that it's impossible to get involved br br for example our four heroes are understandably paranoid about catching the mysterious <UNK> <UNK> that's wiped out virtually all of mankind yet they wear <UNK> masks some times not others some times they're <UNK> about <UNK> down with <UNK> any area touched by an infected person other times they seem completely <UNK> br br worse after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill or be killed world these people constantly behave like total <UNK> they don't bother <UNK> proper equipment or food they're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere they don't take <UNK> <UNK> when meeting strangers and after <UNK> through the rotting corpses of the entire human race they're as <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> you have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long and even if they did why anyone would want to make a movie about them br br so when these <UNK> stop to <UNK> over the moral <UNK> of their actions it's impossible to take their soul searching seriously their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense br br on top of all this we must <UNK> with the dubious acting abilities of chris <UNK> his portrayal of an arrogant young james t kirk might have seemed <UNK> when viewed in isolation but in <UNK> he plays on exactly that same note arrogant and <UNK> it's impossible not to suspect that this <UNK> his entire dramatic range br br on the positive side the film looks excellent it's got an over sharp <UNK> look that really suits the <UNK> us locale but that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper thin and annoying characters even if you're a fan of the end of the world genre you should save yourself the agony of watching <UNK>
<START> if hollywood is to be believed being in the the navy is nothing but a <UNK> though the sailors may complain in chorus about the <UNK> of the ocean it seems that their <UNK> duties are completely non existent and somehow fred astaire finds enough free time during the day to offer dancing classes to a fleet of would be <UNK> such is the world of astaire and rogers mark <UNK> previous film <UNK> hat <UNK> ' completely ignored the great depression that was then bringing america to its knees and presented audiences with a <UNK> world of the rich and famous it was the film's optimistic <UNK> on life that perhaps contributed to its success likewise here <UNK> deliberately forgets that the life of a naval officer is difficult and <UNK> and instead <UNK> the duties of a sailor with an assortment of catchy lightweight musical numbers br br <UNK> baker astaire and <UNK> martin rogers are two former dance partners whose romantic relationship fell apart after the latter rejected a marriage <UNK> after <UNK> returns from several years of duty in the navy he finds <UNK> as dance <UNK> in an <UNK> san francisco ballroom while the two former lovers alternately attempt to woo and <UNK> each other <UNK> plain music teacher sister harriet <UNK> looking really quite pretty receives a complete <UNK> and tries to charm superficial sailor <UNK> <UNK> smith randolph scott there are plenty of the usual screwball comedy <UNK> a few moments of mistaken identity and even a hilarious trained monkey that steals every scene it's in particularly amusing is the scene in which <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> audition in order to create a window for his estranged girl <UNK> for both of them it is an unfortunate <UNK> who drinks the <UNK> of <UNK> and loses her ability to sing br br <UNK> the fleet 1936 ' was the fifth winning collaboration between fred astaire and ginger rogers and the third of five in which <UNK> directed the pair irving berlin provided the film's music and lyrics and each musical number is <UNK> lighthearted and entertaining even if they aren't quite as memorable as those in <UNK> hat <UNK> ' <UNK> time 1936 ' or <UNK> we dance <UNK> ' astaire attempts to break free from his typical rich man about town persona without much success but it's hard to imagine the performer without the <UNK> <UNK> charm that could only <UNK> being considerably wealthy the side plot of the romance between connie and <UNK> works well with the antics of the two main stars and harriet <UNK> wearing a brunette wig to avoid <UNK> with <UNK> blonde hair has a couple of emotional solo numbers including get <UNK> behind me satan which was originally written for <UNK> hat '
<START> this movie is possibly the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> sequel ever made br br yet it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by disney and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish br br it's a group of short stories that seem like bad <UNK> br br spoiler alert the first one's all about beast and belle being petty over a pathetic argument then three loser new characters decide to <UNK> things up by <UNK> a letter of forgiveness to give to belle part way through this little episode belle has wall eyes which made my siblings and i laugh so hard then she and the beast fight more over the letter and later learn the meaning of forgiveness how old are they certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness br br then the next one's all about <UNK> being the world's biggest <UNK> when it comes to romance this coming from the man who could woo anything female and they make <UNK> a psychotic <UNK> who tries to kill belle and winds up getting off <UNK> free by the end of it what a message to send the kids br br then the next one's all about mrs <UNK> being <UNK> and the next one after that's all about beast becoming overly <UNK> of a bird to the point where he just seems downright silly br br the <UNK> so ugly it kills there are at least 100 mistakes you can <UNK> see and the <UNK> is awful br br <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> whenever something goes wrong plus she's petty and very different from the usual belle br br and the side characters are annoying i mean <UNK> and <UNK> fight almost all the time i know they did that in the movie but it was overdone in this br br but the worst character is mrs <UNK> she's ruined in this i can't even describe it just buy it and see for yourself br br i give it a 1 10 for the <UNK> but i give it a 10 10 for comedy
<START> some have praised atlantis the lost empire as a disney adventure for adults i don't think so at least not for thinking adults br br this script suggests a beginning as a live action movie that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore the crack staff of many older adventure movies has been done well before think the dirty dozen but atlantis represents one of the worse films in that <UNK> the characters are weak even the background that each member <UNK> out seems stock and awkward at best an <UNK> medicine man a <UNK> mechanic whose father always wanted sons if we have not at least seen these before we have seen mix and match quirks before the story about how one companion <UNK> played by don <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> went from flower stores to <UNK> totally unconvincing br br only the main character milo <UNK> a young atlantis obsessed academic voiced by michael j fox has any depth to him <UNK> search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him the opening scene shows a much younger milo <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> as his grandfather places his <UNK> helmet on his head br br and while the characters were thin at best the best part about atlantis was the voice talent commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner although rourke is a pretty stock military type garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery <UNK> vocal performance is the high point i'm sorry to say leonard <UNK> dying king is nothing more than obligatory additionally don <UNK> as the <UNK> expert <UNK> <UNK> was also notable for one or two well done funny lines but i've always liked father <UNK> <UNK> anyway br br also well done was the computer animation the background animation that is the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even <UNK> aside from landscapes buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress br br the plot was the worst some say hackneyed or trite i'm not so sure about that any <UNK> plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint so the treatment is the thing and atlantis obviously lacks that br br i cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section the plot was bad the <UNK> bridges snap like <UNK> and the ending does not make sense to add to that the script and the animation is <UNK> with annoying <UNK> br br spoilers br br right at the beginning when milo reveals that <UNK> or <UNK> symbols have been wrongly <UNK> and the coast of ireland should read the coast of <UNK> we begin to have problems the writers of the script would need to know the british take for <UNK> or <UNK> as ireland and completely ignore the older latin term <UNK> but more than this they need to know of the <UNK> conspiracy to call the <UNK> island <UNK> and the <UNK> island <UNK> br br by making it the matter of a <UNK> <UNK> letter the writers have doomed themselves to <UNK> a <UNK> version of english and a post roman date on the script since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its <UNK> cave and without visible clues and less technology than milo had made the <UNK> far less <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> could not be written before the sinking of atlantis or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying in the king's eye it must have been written after the sinking but without even the technology that <UNK> expedition had how the heck did anybody get by the <UNK> so how could it know more about anything after that and why would it be written in <UNK> br br automatic writing and <UNK> or <UNK> travel can explain these things however <UNK> and <UNK> travel do not require to write in <UNK> so it's got to be some sort automatic writing since no one left in atlantis can read it must be the spirits of the crystal <UNK> messages to the surface this would have made more sense but could also have been explained within the movie milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life appeared in dreams etc this needed to be explored in the movie br br the <UNK> should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages no one expects that the original <UNK> europeans would be able to <UNK> in europe anymore than <UNK> would understand that hard c s or their day became french <UNK> s <UNK> like sh s no less br br current <UNK> were alive before the <UNK> when apparently they could read yet now are unable to read what they used to or operate similar <UNK> br br the mass <UNK> points out a crucial flaw in the movie nothing seems to have happened to this culture it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival no one wants to <UNK> poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of <UNK> school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into <UNK> br br <UNK> can be <UNK> for not knowing how to read or operate the <UNK> if she was so young when the <UNK> of stupidity set in but any of it hardly qualifies her father for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> almost single <UNK> wiped his people from existence killed a bunch in the <UNK> <UNK> progress not a lot killed here but he <UNK> a massive slide in culture and progress until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody if they weren't boiled in <UNK> first because the giant robots weren't there to protect them br br a <UNK> of blue electricity should have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when <UNK> tried joining her father's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis br br even though milo was the only one who could read <UNK> rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of <UNK> and find a page on a crystal which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized <UNK> or <UNK> of the sun <UNK> br br if <UNK> grandfather had told rourke about it it still does not explain how rourke would have suffered from <UNK> reading it as part of the book ripping out the page which was dog <UNK> in <UNK> hand even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently only was there to tip off the viewer that something was not quite right unless the word crystal would have set <UNK> off in <UNK> head that somebody would try to steal it milo would have suspected nothing it's just thick headed <UNK> br br the <UNK> double cross was not a character change we learned that <UNK> sweet audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning however the change of heart falls flat it was a change and needed to be better motivated hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with br br <UNK> little bit that the <UNK> flows up over the <UNK> instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from it's <UNK> it will not flow over the protective <UNK> until it fills up all lower areas br br the ending stinks and makes no sense other than to <UNK> political correctness with it's <UNK> restored atlantis is no longer a weak power needing <UNK> the giant robot <UNK> and the sky <UNK> shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might the technology is superior to <UNK> and definitely to early 20th century in the end milo needs to teach the <UNK> to read for what the whole idea is to leave their little quiet <UNK> culture alone not to send it into <UNK> br br end spoilers br br perhaps the lost world plot and the turn of the century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to <UNK> the failures i find with the film agree with this idea but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well and pulp stories is part of the crap they can't sell adults anymore anyway we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well <UNK> of the lost <UNK> lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness br br 4 out of 10 the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot it <UNK> ever lower
<START> i saw <UNK> nightmare not to long ago for the first time and i have to say i really found it to be quite good if you are a fan of dominic <UNK> you will love it the hole movie takes place inside his mind or does it the acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end the extras on the dvd are just as great as the film if not greater for those dom fans it has tons of <UNK> moments from the set <UNK> and a great interview with the director anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess the director dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little <UNK> creepy film it was pretty enjoyable and i'm glad to have it in my collection
<START> the makers have chosen the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it whether the period is the <UNK> the first story the present ie 1950 for the middle story or the <UNK> the last costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created i love the <UNK> costumes of the two old ladies in the <UNK> exquisite <UNK> <UNK> by the finest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> is very appealing but never mind the <UNK> young lovers it's raymond <UNK> as the man who <UNK> his wife's health and independence who <UNK> our emotions he usually played comical pompous types but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive the china <UNK> great 30s film starring gable and harlow stole the plot from the mr know all episode and also <UNK> a story by <UNK> i wish we saw more of <UNK> wayne as the jealous husband though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat i love that posh bird who plays his wife too
<START> it is obviously illegal <UNK> pray on stuff like this how did they get away with making such a movie this movie is all summed up in one word sick where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films as i was watching the movie i didn't actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman sorry if this is a spoiler to you but i would have <UNK> not seen this where has the sanity of these people gone maybe the makers of this movie are <UNK> our society today is filled with all types of sexual <UNK> that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but <UNK> this type of behavior i noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked this is a kid here and someone is asking something like this what is wrong with this picture
<START> this was a cute movie until the ending the ending was merely one more despicable effort to <UNK> men and <UNK> women at their expense the girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive aggressive nature to control and <UNK> her will on the guy who ultimately <UNK> his power and control over the relationship to her it is not by chance that she was sitting behind the <UNK> wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and <UNK> with her to take him back this movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them it was a despicable movie for that reason
<START> i recently purchased the complete american gothic series on dvd and it lived up to my memories of it i was very grateful to be able to view for the first time episodes that were never <UNK> i loved ring of fire in particular of the stories i hadn't seen the first time around br br gary cole is fantastic as evil sexy lucas buck lucas black as <UNK> is also a superb player i thought brenda <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> was also superb in her portrayal in fact the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other br br it's a shame the series was screwed by the network in <UNK> with a <UNK> group of censors because it was truly designed for adult viewing a mixture of comedy tragedy farce satire gothic romance and horror genres it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level br br i had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life long live gary cole sheriff lucas buck the most <UNK> fallen angel ever
<START> <UNK> killer is a madman who shoots people on the <UNK> while yelling a bunch of mystical <UNK> on a car phone the police believe he is a random killer but sunny the blond heroine played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a pattern so does the ex cop played by james russo and they join forces and bodies in the search for the villain who has done away with their <UNK> also starring richard <UNK> this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases but its really not a good movie for the most part check it out if you're really bored and have already seen the <UNK> joy ride or breakdown otherwise stay away from the <UNK>
<START> when someone remakes a classic movie the remake is always <UNK> compared to the original also there's a chance that the remake is so <UNK> different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences br br well the 1973 tv version of double <UNK> has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original the main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all fred macmurray was great as the <UNK> <UNK> insurance agent walter <UNK> in the original richard crenna just seems world weary and tired edward g robinson brought great manic energy to his role as <UNK> boss barton keys lee j <UNK> a fine actor appears almost bored with the proceedings samantha <UNK> is all wrong as the conniving back stabbing <UNK> <UNK> while barbara stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role <UNK> is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place br br robert <UNK> in the old richard <UNK> role as <UNK> boss norton and john <UNK> taking the porter hall role as the crucial witness bring some life to the movie in particular <UNK> <UNK> the norton role well in a 1970s context br br however after the movie starts the whole thing just sort of lies there without any life or electricity this is one film that never should have been remade
<START> i've seen plenty of sci fi channel original movies ever since i started watching them back in 2002 my first one was <UNK> which actually is one of the more entertaining sci fi channel features in my opinion their quality <UNK> some of them are average but decent <UNK> dragon fighter never cry werewolf swamp devil some are laughably bad and then there are some that are truly terrible <UNK> planet lies in the latter br br <UNK> planet a loose sequel to the 2004 sci fi channel original <UNK> island is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy <UNK> the effects that bring the dinosaurs to life a combination of <UNK> and <UNK> as well as cgi and stock footage from <UNK> planet are some of the worst looking effects i've seen in a low budget film the gore effects are even unconvincing br br the plot involves a bunch of <UNK> who for some reason i forget why travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs that's right folks the dinosaurs are aliens dinosaurs in outer space what's next sharks in space the rest of the plot is simple the human cast are picked off and eaten by now we've come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released but this is the first killer dinosaur movie i've seen where i actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks br br there are a few chuckles in it though there's one scene that stands out in which a man is being <UNK> by a <UNK> brought to life by stock footage from the original film that seconds later becomes a giant <UNK> also a bit of trivia this is the scene where steven <UNK> is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie br br while <UNK> island wasn't a good film to begin with its a masterpiece compared to its sequel br br believe me when i say this is quite possibly the worst movie <UNK> has ever aired it's darn near unwatchable
<START> show people is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king <UNK> and starring marion davies and billy haines what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl peggy pepper whose acting is the talk of <UNK> trying to make it on the big screen though she's a success in comedy what she wants to do is make art so she moves up to high arts studio soon she becomes patricia <UNK> and is too good for the likes of her friend billy br br many stars of the silent era have cameos in show people including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup i'm sure when people saw the film in <UNK> they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene sadly nowadays it's not the case even for film buffs in one part of the film however she does meet charlie chaplin in another author <UNK> <UNK> is pointed out to her and <UNK> himself has a cameo at the end of the film other stars who pop up in show people are john gilbert douglas fairbanks william s hart <UNK> joy <UNK> flowers <UNK> <UNK> rod <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and many others br br davies was adorable and a lively <UNK> it's a shame william haines quit the movies he was cute and energetic deservedly an enormous star back in the day br br show people is a simple story told in a witty way it's also a look back at an exciting era in hollywood's history and contains performances by two wonderful stars
<START> i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies when i want a <UNK> i'll go to church but i don't want one from a movie i don't mind some supernatural themes after all religion is about as supernatural as you can get but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed the <UNK> reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies the bad guy even looked like he had <UNK> br br and what a silly ending the hero went into the meeting and <UNK> at all of those old men and that broke the spell if only life were that simple i think that when movies are that stupid they ought to be distributed with a warning danger preaching contained <UNK>
<START> this movie is one of the many kung fu action films made in asia in the late '70s early '80s full of cheap sound effects dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action but unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy when workers of a <UNK> factory are forced out of their jobs by <UNK> bullies they hire a con artist gordon liu to try to scare them off when his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a shaolin temple to learn to fight for real but instead of making him a kung fu student the master instead orders him to build a <UNK> to cover the <UNK> of all <UNK> <UNK> well it turns out that while he's performing these <UNK> tasks <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he's learning the skills to be a kung fu expert it's sort of like in karate kid when mr <UNK> teaches daniel the <UNK> of karate by having him do routine household <UNK> wax on wax off et <UNK> there's lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when gordon liu once again faces his <UNK> <UNK> this time it's not just tricks it's the real thing liu declares proudly <UNK> his chest if you like classic kung fu films you don't want to miss this one
<START> peter m cohen has a winner satire on the <UNK> game twisted around and turned inside out the critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media <UNK> as offensive and raunchy only serves to <UNK> its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated <UNK> of people's sexual <UNK> and passions it is in the tradition of what i call reality based satire following in the footsteps of in the company of men chasing amy your friends and neighbors and two girls and a guy <UNK> dialogue is hilarious and i was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations brian van holt <UNK> <UNK> and jonathan <UNK> are three distinct <UNK> sex obsessed <UNK> who along with the foil of their recently married buddy superbly played by <UNK> <UNK> are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator amanda <UNK> underneath the <UNK> surface <UNK> a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar <UNK> studio products
<START> yokai <UNK> is a children's film by takashi miike but as you might expect it's probably a bit too dark scary for younger ones however older children may well eat this up that is if you play it dubbed in english br br the story is that of a young boy who has moved with his mother to the country to live with his grandfather after a divorce during a village festival the boy is chosen as a <UNK> rider a great honor but with that honor comes much danger and adventure of course br br meanwhile evil <UNK> are at hand as a woman in a white mini <UNK> go go boots a <UNK> hair do teams up with an evil yokai to turn people's <UNK> and <UNK> items against them and this evil has <UNK> itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself tokyo one quite funny scene has two <UNK> watching the monster fly over the city says one oh it's only gamera br br the young boy has <UNK> yokai which are monsters of a kind mostly <UNK> that have isolated themselves away from humans and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evil br br in many ways miike crew have taken the late 60's early 70's yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for older kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of transformers the look and feel of the film is great the effects are entertaining and some of the humor will just <UNK> right over kid's heads but still older ones might enjoy it as for adults there's not much here not to like if you're a fan of japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this br br cool fun stuff kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just miike and what a wild ride 8 out of 10
<START> this is a thriller with a good concept good acting good photography and good intentions all around but which is confused and disjointed in execution br br garcia stars as john berlin an l a <UNK> detective who has moved to a small california town at the <UNK> of a friend of his on the force there he soon becomes involved in the investigation of an <UNK> murder which leads to his <UNK> about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in the known victim is <UNK> to be blind which leads to a romance with a blind girl believed to be a witness at a nearby school for the blind br br despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where i found myself wondering <UNK> the hell did we wind up here ' or <UNK> did we find this out ' i found it confusing and disjointed despite the good acting etc john <UNK> has a small part toward the end as an f b i investigator out to get berlin br br not recommended
<START> i recently rented the animated version of the lord of the rings on video after seeing the fantastic 2001 live action version of the film the lord of the rings live action trilogy directed by peter jackson will <UNK> be far better than george <UNK> star wars prequel trilogy episodes 1 3 will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century br br i remember seeing the animated version as a child and i didn't quite understand the depth of the film at that time now that i have read the books i understand what the whole storyline is all about to be sure some of the characters are quite silly <UNK> <UNK> is particularly annoying almost as much as jar jar <UNK> in star wars episode one awful but i have to say it follows the book rather closely and it goes into part of book two the two towers the good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it's time the bad things are that it ends <UNK> halfway through the two towers without any result of <UNK> quest to destroy the one ring and the animation looks quite dated compared to today's standards br br overall not as bad as many say it is but the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of the lord of the rings at least ralph bakshi took the script seriously peter jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film so we can at least thank ralph bakshi for that matter i'll take the animated version of lord of the rings over the live version of harry potter <UNK> br br a 7 out of a scale of 1 10 far less violent than the 2001 live action version but nowhere near as good for <UNK> fans of the books and film versions of the lord of the rings
<START> i voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of <UNK> <UNK> however it was his usual mix of art sex and pretentious crap i know lots of people like this film but i grew tired of it very quickly it is definitely not for everyone the <UNK> <UNK> obviously took the part for <UNK> sake i guess but he really should not have wasted his time i hate to <UNK> anyone to <UNK> corner but please on the plus side it is visually very attractive and i enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and i cannot say that for many movies i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable
<START> one of john ford's best films 'the <UNK> doesn't feature any grand scenery of the american west instead the intense drama ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged <UNK> of british character actor victor <UNK> face the former <UNK> who once faced joe louis in the ring delivers an academy award winning portrayal of <UNK> ira soldier gypo nolan on the worst night of his life br br the plot is <UNK> simple in <UNK> <UNK> a starving and <UNK> man who's been thrown out of the ira for being unable to kill an <UNK> in cold blood himself becomes an <UNK> for <UNK> he betrays a friend to the <UNK> and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly <UNK> <UNK> of guilt denial self pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions br br it is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple gypo that is the film's most impressive achievement in most movies a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> type would be cast as the heavy he'd have at best two or three lines and be <UNK> of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown in 'the <UNK> gypo himself is both hero and villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil every bit of which is <UNK> shared with the audience br br because liam <UNK> novel had previously been filmed in <UNK> rko gave ford a very modest budget the director and his associates particularly cinematographer joseph h august turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself in addition to <UNK> oscar 'the <UNK> also won john ford his first along with wins for best screenplay and best score
<START> alright before we review i have to ask why isn't this listed <UNK> it may have been merely a tv item in italy but to international <UNK> <UNK> fans this is its own film in america this film is distributed on vhs and dvd as either the ogre or demons 3 yes i know it has nothing to do with demons apart from one cast member and the crew but yes i personally was upset that this was so hard to find on this site which is otherwise so useful br br finally let's review the ogre i've seen the trailer for this many times on youtube and honestly found that rather scary the movie itself it is feature length therefore making it a movie has many many strong parts and does manage to scare i was <UNK> by the last act but on the whole i don't regret having bought the dvd before seeing it available from <UNK> show i guess the film's tv origins explain the last act i won't give out any spoilers br br the plot is somewhat familiar an american horror writer <UNK> at an ancient spooky castle with husband and son only to find it exactly resembles the setting of her childhood nightmares there are faint echoes of the shining but this is a different brand of supernatural horror the woman virginia <UNK> finds more and more proof that this is the real life place of her nightmares but her husband won't believe her great atmosphere and terror follow br br the multiple nightmare sequences were pretty freaky the ogre <UNK> effect was good it reminded me a bit of uncle <UNK> <UNK> from the first <UNK> there's also a few good shocks and a well done underwater scene i give them props that the film never <UNK> to imitating american films with similar concepts namely a nightmare on elm street the ogre is an original and the monster itself was a scary one when it was presented correctly br br on the <UNK> show dvd there is a <UNK> <UNK> interview in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic demons series he also gives a lot of credit to the real castle in which the movie was filmed indeed this setting contributes a lot to the film the simon <UNK> music helps too br br there's lots of good stuff here the ogre is not perfect but it is very much worth seeing take it is a lesser <UNK> <UNK> achievement
<START> i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was i am so glad i didn't pay to see this movie and that i didn't sit in a movie theater for this one where to begin on this movie the acting in this movie was average the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn't special i thought that this movie was suppose to be great but it wasn't more than a cheesy waste of time i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry it just wasn't there i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay <UNK> it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didn't get the feeling that he wasn't acting in this movie now alice eve did a great job as an actress but there was no chemistry between her and jay all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie the humor in this movie was not funny at all there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy i honestly think he needs to stick with the <UNK> king commercials i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love <UNK> i think that it would have been better if it had more originality but what a letdown nothing i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie so save yourself the agony and just don't see it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a very lost player in the short cartoon market this market is essentially dominated by the looney tunes and the merry <UNK> shorts coming from warner bros but mgm is also able of releasing hidden gems like to spring an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year br br in the environment depicted here spring isn't caused by natural <UNK> but is <UNK> and by who by little male <UNK> who live below ground each spring when the snow begins to melt they start working they begin by <UNK> <UNK> rock <UNK> then <UNK> them to <UNK> and using this <UNK> to turn it into color <UNK> which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass flowers in other words spring the first half of the cartoon depicts <UNK> <UNK> but the second part is a little bit different old man winter comes back and he tries to <UNK> winter by destroying the <UNK> work so from this point we assist to a battle between the <UNK> and old man winter br br the music heard here is deliciously wonderful the <UNK> parts stick in the head like an <UNK> spot on a paper sheet the second part <UNK> are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action this is just <UNK> <UNK> the animation sequences are also a delight the colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive epic environment the concept itself is brilliant the <UNK> are <UNK> characters so is old man winter who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season br br there's also a strong message included here the battle seems lost for the <UNK> at the end until a single late arriving <UNK> jump into the action and it leads to the <UNK> victory over winter so the point is only one single person can make the difference br br in conclusion to spring is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era what is even more remarkable is that this <UNK> director made his debut here and who is to spring 's director it's a certain william <UNK>

<START> this is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made amitabh as a country <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is hilarious the best thing is the laughter never stops the plot is a same old same old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty with a happy reunion at the end there are villains <UNK> and there are brothers <UNK> kapoor and there are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and there are lovers <UNK> <UNK> and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure but this movie is about amitabh and thats all you remember at then end br br amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious later in the movie he turns into the angry young man he is famous for but the humour stays memorable parts include his walking talking and speaking english the song pad <UNK> re <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and everything with his <UNK> br br all in all i was rolling with laughter throughout the movie if you want 3 hours of entertainment with amitabh at his absolute best this is it it will easily give it a 10 10
<START> to movie this movie felt like one of those after school <UNK> only lower budget and lower everything else i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort but it didn't work for me yet some how it comes across as preachy it has very pale shades of flash dance but so what there just isn't any excitement in this movie the dialogue is contrived and clichéd to death of course the whole movie feels like a bad 80's cliché the acting was less than stellar though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given or in this case not to work with on top of that is the poor song choices with really bad lyrics i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved they are all talented but you can't tell from this movie this is just my opinion of course but i have to give flying aka dream to believe a 1 10
<START> my husband and i just got done watching this movie i was not expecting it to be this good i was really <UNK> at how great the story line was i'm usually very good at <UNK> out <UNK> plots but this one had me i loved it i'm going to have to watch it again before i take it back i might even have to buy it
<START> c'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode it's just an old 60's tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe <UNK> <UNK> ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real <UNK> location unlike the <UNK> and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages br br this use of an <UNK> location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show br br except a few notable exceptions i e the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously <UNK> <UNK> and put out of it's boring misery half a dozen good episodes from <UNK> is quite a poor <UNK> average br br this is typical of the boring stuff gene <UNK> produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people <UNK> the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example br br just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used <UNK> <UNK> for the floor <UNK> <UNK> with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the <UNK> <UNK> you can clearly see the <UNK> in the paper every expense <UNK> or what
<START> first of all this film was not released to theatres tested poorly they say i say they figured the story of crooked cops politicians dedicated newspaper people had been done to death just send it dvd cable tv take the money run br br that being said i usually like this type of movie especially with this named cast morgan freeman justin timberlake kevin spacey br br l l cool j cary <UNK> john heard on the <UNK> side <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the plot story have been done to death but the above cast brings life to this violent movie it is actually watchable br br justin timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw away newspaper edited by morgan freeman the others are either crooked cops politicians or somewhat decent guys the 2 ladies are the girl friends of ll cool j justin timberlake do whats required it is quite violent many killings etc not for children by no means is the a great film but for what it is the cast it is definitely good br br ratings out of 4 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10
<START> william <UNK> final outing as philo vance occurs in the <UNK> murder case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind it's all in the <UNK> out of how that leads to the who and why br br the philo vance murders by s s van <UNK> were most popular at the time and the clever mr van <UNK> figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio <UNK> this is why you see so many philo <UNK> and so many studios putting them out had bill powell not gone on to greater fame with mgm as nick charles of the thin man series he would have been known as the greatest of philo <UNK> br br it turns out that powell had entered his little <UNK> captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim as usual powell shows up eugene palette as sergeant heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found br br i did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in <UNK> out the how powell has a lovely group of suspects as extensive as what normally is in a thin man mystery people like paul <UNK> helen <UNK> ralph morgan mary <UNK> fill their cast roles well br br warner brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the thirties with james <UNK> in his one and only outing as philo vance it doesn't hold a candle to this one br br as this is the only powell philo vance that is out on vhs or dvd by all means see this one or <UNK> it if you can
<START> the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon who i've had a crush on since <UNK> grade which was his first year on snl i am a die hard <UNK> fan and i didn't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes when they begin showing clips of the <UNK> games i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i wouldn't have to hear that which must not be heard but otherwise it was completely bearable br br i thought jimmy played the role very well because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky and he is a nervous and quirky guy i know that it may not be a academy award winning stretch but the movie is just a light fun romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see br br jimmy and drew worked well together and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie what i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodness because taxi could have killed it i think fever pitch will help him out a lot everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies i imagine it must be difficult and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time tom hanks russell <UNK> etc you'll see that they started off in some <UNK> <UNK> buddies australian soap operas here's wishing jimmy a successful career on screen i never wanted him to leave snl but what can you do
<START> where to begin how about with the <UNK> synopsis br br x men origins <UNK> tells the story of <UNK> <UNK> violent and romantic past his complex relationship with victor <UNK> and the ominous weapon x program br br his <UNK> violent past turns out to exceptionally non violent br br his relationship with <UNK> is so <UNK> over it's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all we are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long <UNK> and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of <UNK> br br there is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving br br the romantic element of the movie between <UNK> and <UNK> was forced and abrupt we are thrown into a romance so fast that it's over before you can blink an eye having just introduced the character <UNK> is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later we are left wondering why we should care about this who was she anyway br br for a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story the romance is surprisingly <UNK> it was rushed in simply because it was required br br oddly enough when <UNK> finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to <UNK> as he goes off to find <UNK> being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise br br as for the weapon x program lets just say that after the painfully <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is up and running eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet <UNK> loving couple surprisingly ma and <UNK> kent aren't <UNK> when finding a naked <UNK> man in their <UNK> is it any wonder what fate <UNK> them br br in the previous films and the comic books the main reason that <UNK> <UNK> plagued him partly <UNK> on the fact that he was said to have been <UNK> evil and <UNK> br br knowing this was the case did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates br br as hinted to in <UNK> x men united when <UNK> gives up some of his secrets it is said that <UNK> would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together this film sets up the team fairly well only they don't really do much of anything no disturbing violence no ruthless actions they merely <UNK> a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen br br it seems that <UNK> wasn't an evil man under <UNK> at all instead he was constantly trying to put a <UNK> on his brother <UNK> which consequently was the violent agent we all thought <UNK> was eventually he just leaves all together br br no conflict of <UNK> here at all br br <UNK> <UNK> that character conflict of good and evil <UNK> the story immensely they may as well have given him rubber <UNK> br br there were a ton of other errors in this film that <UNK> the x men trilogy including the introduction of one of the <UNK> <UNK> ex <UNK> to ever hit a script br br magic memory <UNK> bullets br br really br br apparently they are the only thing to bring down <UNK> yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all br br another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on <UNK> while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story most were in the film for 5 10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of <UNK> br br fred dukes the blob but not the comic version can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all but a simple <UNK> from <UNK> metal <UNK> is enough to <UNK> him br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which instead of being <UNK> force are now more akin to <UNK> can burn through buildings but when fired at <UNK> directly it simply <UNK> him into the ground without even <UNK> his clothes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anyone br br the gravity <UNK> mutant <UNK> instead of <UNK> his signature cards is made into some sort of crazy <UNK> in one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by <UNK> then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a <UNK> running towards <UNK> how he <UNK> consciousness ran away a few <UNK> <UNK> up a building then ran back to <UNK> and <UNK> in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained br br some have <UNK> this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash the idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect br br the comic book source material the real origin of <UNK> is a story worth bringing to the screen it doesn't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless cgi <UNK> it is a well crafted story and although <UNK> and <UNK> over time began with weapon x by barry <UNK> smith a much more intense and exciting story br br this fox film should seriously be forgotten br br anyone have that magic gun br br 4 10
<START> the first von trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa europa tells a story of a young german american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a <UNK> on a <UNK> train because of his job he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany meeting with the killing of <UNK> and hunt for former nazi party members the society is suffering from corruption his uncle has <UNK> his <UNK> by <UNK> on the job he has also as a <UNK> on the train by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called <UNK> they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains the atmosphere is astounding the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under <UNK> and then counting to wake you up in a new scene just when you think you've seen a lot europe
<START> i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket after popping it into my dvd player i re examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any <UNK> to it here on imdb br br the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good then a line reading actor spoke oh dear this actor's reading sounded like some <UNK> faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync then had to <UNK> it was a foreign film since i couldn't read the jacket english dialog dubbed if they'd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog this film might have been decent i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before <UNK> it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn't going to get killed off but stay as the constant main <UNK> yes it is that bad the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great so gave the one star but minus 1 <UNK> <UNK> stars for the rotten dialog i do not recommend this one
<START> absolutely unwatchable lowest quality film making this film makes show girls look good the acting is <UNK> the cinematography gives a bad name to <UNK> no wonder it went right to video and <UNK> the theaters this film wasn't released it escaped
<START> i saw the movie recently and really liked it i surprised myself and cried this movie is in the same <UNK> genre as away from her or even the bucket list but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity it's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as <UNK> the director does a masterful job with the challenge <UNK> hard to understand her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all br br the first scene gets this across without any compromise <UNK> ellen <UNK> is being taken to a <UNK> home by her son and daughter in law she figures it out en route and freaks out her edges are really hard she is mean she is <UNK> and selfish she is a stone i didn't like her not even a little bit br br throughout the course of the movie we get insight we find out why she doesn't like <UNK> why she <UNK> one son over the other how her <UNK> have formed her character i started to see the angel and i started to like her i especially liked her when she <UNK> out her secrets to the boy in the shack ellen <UNK> you are a brilliant actor kudos kudos kudos what a scene br br this isn't a feel good movie but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect they are there for a reason br br <UNK> isn't my mother she isn't even my mother in law or neighbor but parts of her are present in many women and men in my life those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i've watched the stone angel
<START> this movie was an attempt to go into places most don't and perhaps shouldn't venture into it was a similar trial at the bizarre head case perspective given to us in the cell although not near as in depth and well portrayed the plot is constructed simply with an initial campy feel to it then as the movie takes its supposed dramatic turn the plot falls apart on what few legs it had to stand on in the first place br br basically the idea is that of a kid chris <UNK> who needs money he takes on the role of a hit man killing a city <UNK> then he doesn't get paid for his work but instead gets tortured for several days because he <UNK> up the brilliant idea of trying to use a <UNK> file he had as <UNK> for <UNK> this idiotic move at trying to force them to pay him <UNK> as he is horribly and endlessly abused he begins to go crazy some very disturbing scenes then thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over he visits the wife <UNK> <UNK> of the man who he killed and wins her affections soon after she discovers who he is tragedy strikes and revenge <UNK> through the air as the boy goes after his <UNK> daniel baldwin george <UNK> <UNK> wells for their previous kindness br br i got to ask though what is it with <UNK> <UNK> and horror gore type films br br it seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre granted i liked her in eight <UNK> freaks and she was okay in <UNK> but despite all her obvious <UNK> and <UNK> wow she's hot she can act much better and chose better roles or maybe i'm wrong and that is just a <UNK> for all you guys out there you get to see the fully monty of her in this film although it's rather bizarre and short lived i almost felt like she did some soft porn after watching this film something not foreign to <UNK> career the sex <UNK> is such that it has to make you wonder what things really go on during filming br br anyway i will say there is some good acting just don't expect much of it from daniel <UNK> whose career seems forever destined to second his brother <UNK> the film did bring out a few old <UNK> though george <UNK> norm from cheers and <UNK> wells <UNK> weird science above all chris <UNK> does the best job in playing the main character sean <UNK> his little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth bring some elements of substance to the film br br i wouldn't go out of my way for this one if you're bored and are tired of the same old episodes of the <UNK> then i might advise watching this br br and <UNK> please start acting in some better films
<START> i think that deep down in the darkest <UNK> part of their heart everyone likes jerry springer just a little bit while his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good when you look at the trailer park <UNK> dollar <UNK> <UNK> incest <UNK> people on the springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful he <UNK> a political career to host the show just for us br br what we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie <UNK> <UNK> shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think the movie follows the pre requisite springer story line love <UNK> one triangle involves connie her daughter angel and her husband rusty the other involves <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> when the two hapless groups meet up in la their lives <UNK> and <UNK> head on all culminating in an explosive episode of the springer show it's like what short cuts would be if robert altman had had a severe crack habit br br <UNK> is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish it also makes me very glad that i don't live in the <UNK> it's characters do but the movie has a problem it's billed as a comedy but it just isn't very funny what laughs there are to be had are few and far between maybe some people watch this and laugh non stop if you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then i guess you're one of those folks personally i laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the <UNK> horrors of white trash life br br the jerry springer show just isn't meant to make the leap from tv to the silver screen what's funny in an hour long show less when you count commercials isn't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie movies have to tell a story and that's something else <UNK> has trouble with the story is <UNK> there are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put <UNK> and even if there weren't such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story even the hollywood formula couldn't make this better <UNK> is so bad it even <UNK> up the best part of the springer show the final thought somehow even the <UNK> and <UNK> aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the <UNK> women the film is built around br br the worst <UNK> in all of this is springer himself he's such a bad actor that he can't even play himself convincingly watching springer play springer is sad it's like he was going for a <UNK> if woody allen played jerry <UNK> vibe and he failed miserably he went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much better br br not that i'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance just the opposite they all suck not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness the best any of them was did was molly <UNK> landing a job on a <UNK> sitcom apparently <UNK> has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the <UNK> to star in a children's program it makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their <UNK> br br here are my final thoughts what we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely brain damaged <UNK> of goo i say no somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us we just have to keep looking for it until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones and don't ever watch <UNK>

<START> we do not come across movies on brother sister relationship in indian cinema or any other language or medium this relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels typically a sister is depicted as a pile on who can be used for <UNK> in the climax this movie treats the subject in an entirely different light br br it is inspired by george <UNK> novel the mill on the <UNK> the brother is very <UNK> all good the blue eyed boy who is a <UNK> good son and a favorite with his mother the sister is romantic wild and <UNK> of the <UNK> rules of the society in spite of this the love of the brother sister is the winner br br this movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later it is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world br br although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true
<START> a young man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and <UNK> throughout the movie whether predictable or not and <UNK> of <UNK> beliefs this is a moving story full of <UNK> and <UNK> br br one other thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible but the elements for this are set up subtly note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field note how he is holding the <UNK> wheel and his <UNK> he is <UNK> and operating dangerous equipment to this day <UNK> are pretty dangerous
<START> anna charlotte burke develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation a bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the <UNK> of an old <UNK> house in the middle of a lonely field lacking in detail much like any child drawing the house and it's <UNK> marc who can't walk because anna didn't draw him any legs are inhabitants of this <UNK> <UNK> world anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what's what and in the process tries to help save the boy but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her but trap her and marc there forever br br wow is a good word to sum up bernard <UNK> brilliantly haunting and poetic paperhouse a film that is so simple that it's damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget while you may find this puppy in your horror section it's anything but it's more of a serious fantasy expertly directed and exceptionally well acted by it's cast in particular charlotte burke and elliot <UNK> marc and yet it's not a children's movie either but meant to make us remember those <UNK> days of old that are now just dark memories rose creates a rich <UNK> of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with paperhouse stays away from trying to explain it's more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination there's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind engrossing you with it's very own sense of reasoning as the story <UNK> i was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye br br bernard <UNK> visuals are brilliant here he's able to create an <UNK> bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface but as a whole is much greater than the sum of it's parts the acting is of young charlotte burke in this her feature debut is a truly <UNK> as well unfortunately she's not <UNK> the screen since a much deserved <UNK> central award only seems proper for that performance toward the end the movie <UNK> a bit here and there but i was easily able to overlook it i wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect the movie as is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover it's a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child a powerful film in which much is left to be <UNK> and far more to be praised

<START> this movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is <UNK> than the original its comedy at its best this movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second at more than one occasion the entire audience laughed <UNK> at a joke br br its a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> 2 also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production tv series such as survivor <UNK> robinson in swedish this is a swedish movie for the swedish audience thus don't see it if you aren't familiar with sweden and its language otherwise have fun <UNK>
<START> the direction struck me as poor man's <UNK> bergman the <UNK> dialogue was annoying the somber <UNK> that all characters except <UNK> showed made me think they were drugged i think the director ruined it for me
<START> the man in the white suit is another <UNK> in the cap of expert scottish director alexander <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sweet smell of success the star of the film is alec guinness whose comedies include kind hearts and <UNK> and the <UNK> hill mob <UNK> brings his usual class to the film and makes it much more than a typical comedy br br in fact the comedy isn't entirely overt by the end of the picture it's nearly become a complete drama it's the sort of ealing studio comedy that is <UNK> not to produce laughter but a sense of general amusement like the best british comedy of the time br br the whole idea of the suit isn't very original but the way it is executed is the film is highly original and recommended to any fan of <UNK> or <UNK> comedy br br 7 6 out of 10

<START> galaxy express <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> three nine made in 1979 directed by <UNK> based on the original work by <UNK> <UNK> br br what little i know of the history of galaxy express <UNK> it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is set in the same star wars type of space universe as <UNK> other famous space manga captain <UNK> in fact space pirate <UNK> and other characters from that manga including queen <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> make appearances in <UNK> <UNK> was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes it was aired in 1978 a year later came this anime film which isn't a sequel to the series but <UNK> the main points of the story in two hours long movie br br the story is set in <UNK> star wars type of future where <UNK> to different planets has become a possibility people of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years maybe even forever the protagonist <UNK> <UNK> is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel count <UNK> whose entire body is made of mechanical parts kills <UNK> mother <UNK> <UNK> revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body to obtain it he must travel to a far away planet with space train galaxy express <UNK> however since <UNK> comes from poverty he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket by a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman <UNK> who bears a resemblance to his dead mother <UNK> offers a ticket for <UNK> on a condition that she <UNK> him on his journey and so the journey <UNK> br br i first saw this film last october about six months from now and again yesterday i feel that i must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film it seems very rushed then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series whatever the case the situations change with a fast speed and <UNK> meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance i feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes br br however there's no arguing that <UNK> has deserved its place as an anime classic the animation itself very faithful to the style of <UNK> manga is detailed and beautiful to watch even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become out of date but puts many later anime films in shame the music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat old these day it was the 70's after all i have not heard any english dub of this film so i can only comment the japanese audio which is good voice actors give life to their characters most memorable ones being <UNK> <UNK> mainly known as the voice of <UNK> through out the entire dragon ball saga as the excited and young <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the calm and mysterious <UNK> the supporting characters are not left in shadows but also have a life of their own most memorable to me being waitress claire br br the story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours as well as for those who try to find deeper messages <UNK> is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as <UNK> journey from <UNK> to <UNK> the whole film is told from his point of view so we are forced to feel what he feels i think many people can relate to <UNK> for despite the fantasy elements he is a very realistic character young hot headed awkward and naive we follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not <UNK> on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end when she reveals who and what she really is it doesn't much answer to anything <UNK> can be seen as a dream of a growing young man always close but just out of reach br br it's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> that still <UNK> talking and questions and <UNK> after the decades people have <UNK> if their relationship is that of a two friends of mother and son or of two possible lovers which wakes a lot of critique since <UNK> age is unknown and <UNK> hasn't even reached his <UNK> yet without any means to sound deep i think the best term to describe them is soul mates there is no question that the two feel devotion caring and love for each others yet it goes beyond that of friendship family and lovers i think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters the ending scene even if you already know what is going to happen is still very touching and memorable br br all in all despite the <UNK> of plot and some corny scenes galaxy express <UNK> holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1988 and <UNK> <UNK> ghost in the shell 1995 the film is directed by <UNK> who had previous experience of <UNK> <UNK> works as he had worked in captain <UNK> series later <UNK> directed a wonderful looking metropolis 2001 that also questions the difference between humans and machines br br galaxy express <UNK> 1979 is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan
<START> this show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel it is billed as reality but in <UNK> it is pure prime time soap opera it's tries to use exotic locales as a <UNK> to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style br br it also borrows from an early cbs game show <UNK> beat the clock by <UNK> situations for its contestants to try overcome then it <UNK> the winner money if they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better while the game format is in slow motion versus beat the clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br this show has elements of several types of successful past programs reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea if your not this entire series is as i say drivel dripping with <UNK> it is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000 br br it is slick well produced so it might last a while yet after all so do re runs of <UNK> island green <UNK> the beverly <UNK> the brady bunch this just doesn't employ professional actors the intelligence level is about the same
<START> this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff <UNK> jimmy stewart and <UNK> castle ruth roman she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the <UNK> to <UNK> and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction neither <UNK> a member of the opposite sex apparently because both have been married to <UNK> who cheated on them gradually they learn to trust each other as they journey from <UNK> to dawson but <UNK> clearly has close <UNK> with corrupt sheriff gannon and <UNK> in some shady practices in her castle saloon in <UNK> she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff meanwhile <UNK> a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff but only gets insulting brush offs in return yet she sticks with him in his travels from <UNK> to dawson and his activities around dawson along with <UNK> she <UNK> him back to health after jeff is left for dead by <UNK> <UNK> at his gold claim walter brennan as ben serves as <UNK> long time sidekick he doesn't have a <UNK> role but serves to <UNK> <UNK> hard edges his demise <UNK> opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeff br br john mcintire as sheriff gannon makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film <UNK> charm and humor to go along with his bullying evidently he sees something of himself in jeff repeatedly <UNK> that he's going to like him he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous <UNK> smith who spent his last years in <UNK> as one of the <UNK> con men of his times br br jeff is the quintessential <UNK> a loner except for companion ben who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others even when he knows he is the one right man for the job in this respect he closely <UNK> burt <UNK> character in vera <UNK> for example thus jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of dawson he is convinced to leave dawson after <UNK> gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's <UNK> legal gold claims while <UNK> of some <UNK> and suggesting that the rest make a <UNK> exit from dawson even <UNK> suggests that she and jeff make a <UNK> exit from dawson while they are still alive then jeff has a sudden change of heart apparently still <UNK> desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself he changes from anti hero to hero in leading the <UNK> of <UNK> gang from dawson in this respect he <UNK> from <UNK> character who never <UNK> but is jeff truly changed or just <UNK> out revenge for <UNK> committed against his own interests br br the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women clearly <UNK> is <UNK> as the right woman to tame jeff although she is clearly <UNK> as a bad girl jeff has a <UNK> recent past himself having shot at least 5 men in the us or <UNK> and having stolen his cattle back from gannon ironically soon after jeff changes from anti hero to hero <UNK> makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of <UNK> impending <UNK> she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she didn't just look out for herself his supposedly just abandoned <UNK> br br it's clear that <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead <UNK> in <UNK> mind yet the apparent <UNK> of the <UNK> scene is that they get together even though jeff never <UNK> gives her a kiss or hug her image as a good if naive young woman is somewhat <UNK> by her job in <UNK> saloon of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their gold dust pushing the <UNK> dust on the floor and recovering it later i'm also very unclear about her relationship with <UNK> morris a middle aged <UNK> who followers her around and works a claim with her he's not her father br br another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and <UNK> gang if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that <UNK> before jeff did the same to him and how did <UNK> badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the <UNK> victims they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow and why weren't most of <UNK> pack horses and <UNK> also buried by the <UNK> br br you will see a host of probably <UNK> but familiar faces among the <UNK> and <UNK> gang the sequences shot in the canadian <UNK> provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action all in all a very entertaining western with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end no doubt this film takes some great liberties with history and <UNK> especially the part taking place in the canadian <UNK> which was in fact much <UNK> than the us <UNK>
<START> paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt it does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into <UNK> and deals very <UNK> and <UNK> with the cultural conflict the main family experiences br br unfortunately this <UNK> of a good movie is imprisoned in an <UNK> and extremely convoluted plot that manages to <UNK> religious <UNK> a conflict over a road construction project the sex life of secondary and even <UNK> characters a mysterious man who lives in the woods a bunch of racist <UNK> at least three different <UNK> the <UNK> of local church politics and on and on and on and all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot which is only about the hopes dreams and <UNK> of two girls and their entire families at the turning point of their lives i was actually shocked when i realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer and that so much movie got accomplished in 1 5 hours br br ultimately the movie is melodramatic every plot point is predictable major life <UNK> events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later and some of those events are extremely <UNK> most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime in a totally predictable twist and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on similarly a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another twist it's all totally mechanical right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends well not all of them just the ones the movie thinks you care about
<START> giant is one of the most boring overly long hollywood <UNK> ever many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy rock hudson elizabeth taylor and james dean are wasted in this big hollywood production a central notion to this movie that a <UNK> would ever resist <UNK> for oil on his land is absurd and i know this because i'm from <UNK> a couple of scenes especially dean serving taylor coffee redeem this otherwise boring film for a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how <UNK> changed the <UNK> in texas see <UNK> one of paul <UNK> great performances or the last picture show
