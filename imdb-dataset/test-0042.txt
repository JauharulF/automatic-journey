<START> i have watched my fair bit of bollywood films when growing up you know the typical plot boy meets girl girl rejects boys bad guys take away girl boy <UNK> girl by killing hundreds of and they happily get married of course i've <UNK> an hour of musical style numbers well going into watch <UNK> <UNK> i was expecting another typical bollywood style movie however to my delight it turned out to be <UNK> and indeed quite comical <UNK> <UNK> is what could be labeled as one of those <UNK> indian films such as the ever popular south asian hits as <UNK> wedding east is east or bend it like beckham br br being of south asian decent and having watched various classic bollywood films there was much humour and sub dialogs which could be picked up that reminded me of the fun and charming side of indian culture e g the various <UNK> pop numbers which were actually remade by <UNK> or the witty indian that were used <UNK> <UNK> can be enjoyed by all south <UNK> and is also entertaining for those not to the indian humor as the characters and plot <UNK> to all audiences br br in a the movie is of auto <UNK> driver aka <UNK> for those of you who have traveled to india know played by from <UNK> wedding who gets himself involved with a crook and ends up <UNK> him quite a bit of money to avoid selling his four <UNK> he escapes <UNK> with and a very charismatic and lovely woman from france <UNK> who herself is escaping the boredom of her boyfriend benoit jean marie <UNK> who was in swimming pool the movie is of their journey traveling across the beautiful landscape of <UNK>  the land of love stories through the humour you see the two main actors trying to find out who they are really are br br what made the night most memorable was having the director executive producer main editor and even the mother of ms present at the screening after speaking with who actually has a <UNK> background many interesting <UNK> of the film were <UNK> including having the film finished only 10 days prior to the toronto international film festival and taking only 45 days to shoot and having only five actors in the play the rest were all first time real actors arriving home i realized two things from the movie that there is always a human connection between any one of us despite our differences and secondly as the director had put it has a love <UNK> br br its a must see for everyone
<START> this film is <UNK> along with <UNK> le <UNK> lo and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd <UNK> first both films are very dark occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening second neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film though <UNK> del does seem to have a better dub personally i always prefer subtitles but for the non <UNK> out there this isn't a problem these dvd problems however are not the fault of the original film makers just the indifferent package being <UNK> four decades later br br as for the film it's about the assassination of president garfield this is a major problem as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield he's missing the beard has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way trust me on this i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers <UNK> drop boxes plus using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho he was a fine actor but certainly not a convincing general or macho president br br in addition to the stupid casting president <UNK> death was in no way like this film it's obvious that the film makers are actually <UNK> in on the crazy <UNK> about <UNK> concerning the death of <UNK> not garfield garfield was shot in washington <UNK> not dallas by a lone <UNK> with severe mental problems not a group of men with <UNK> however according to most experts what actually killed garfield over two months later were incompetent doctors who and and to retrieve a bullet to no <UNK> and never bothered cleaning their hands or <UNK> in the process in other words like george washington who was basically killed by repeated <UNK> when suffering with <UNK> he died due to <UNK> in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever other than indeed president garfield was shot br br because the film bears almost no similarity to real history it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury why not also include ninjas fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it aside from some decent acting and production values because the script is utter cow crap i don't recommend anyone watch it it's just a complete and utter mess
<START> who'd a thought suicide could be dealt with in a way that's <UNK> by everyone i saw the film at <UNK> at it's <UNK> and it turned out to be the best film there by far yes its <UNK> and it's bizarre but it makes sense in the world the filmmaker michael creates if you didn't laugh most everyone did then you just ain't getting it and thats a darn shame particularly of note <UNK> diaz as hector steals a bunch of scenes and the chemistry between natasha and david is intense the film reminds one of harold and <UNK> but not really it takes one bizarre spin after another and they do all make sense in this crazy mixed up world we all live in i stayed as did most for the q a afterward and what was great was hearing that the same things i thought in my head as to why things happened are the reasons they did i don't think you can say much bad about the film unless you didn't get it i think i got it and it seemed like most everyone else did as well the film is dubbed a <UNK> comedy but its got a lot of heart a lot of laughs and offers a lot of hope yet it doesn't shy away from the horrors of suicide as well a nice little movie that should get attention when it gets a release which will hopefully happen sooner rather than later
<START> ok about 11 years ago the awesome funny movie the mask came out and everyone loved it and now 11 years later the mask is brought back in this awesome movie right wrong this movie was the stupidest movie that i have probably ever seen i mean when i rented it i thought that i would be laughing so hard that i would almost pee my pants like from the first one but after i saw this <UNK> i <UNK> even let out a chuckle i mean no offense to the director or the cast of this movie but what a waste of time and money so the plot of the whole story was about this little baby that has part of the mask in him and this evil person is after him for some thing because that is all i really got i would have least added some more things to it so it would be higher than a 2 out of 10 stars
<START> this takes place in 1920s harlem a black owned nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt policemen br br terrible vanity project for eddie murphy it tries to mix comedy and drama and fails at both the comedy simply isn't funny and the drama is boring and badly acted you think a film with three comedy legends eddie murphy <UNK> foxx and richard <UNK> would be great but it isn't there's <UNK> swearing and the opening scene has a young boy shooting a man to death this is shown as being ok also we have the beautiful della reese <UNK> into playing a <UNK> one of the comedic highlights has a long unfunny and terribly vicious fight between her and murphy a boring offensive and stupid mess not the worst murphy movie but pretty close a 1 all the way
<START> i watched this movie on <UNK> television today i was absolutely enthralled by the powerful messages and plot line within this film i don't want to spoil it i will say this i related to the inner struggle of aaron and his upbringing as a gay man growing up in a small town i related so well to the big secret and the choices i made this movie has made a huge impact on me and i plan on buying a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library i no more than finished the movie and began calling my friends to recommend it it had that profound of an effect on me to those who read this comment watch it try to have as little distraction as possible also keep an open mind this is not a film that can be viewed like a disney film or the movie of the week instead take the time to watch and <UNK> listen to the dialog as well as read between the lines and get involved in the plot you may find yourself in tears not since steel <UNK> have i been moved to tears by a film this one did just that thank you to the cast and writer and crew for producing an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion it has been long <UNK>
<START> your idol will <UNK> you in this movie stephen <UNK> is <UNK> cast as a young german student still <UNK> under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years old this makes his relationship a collection of <UNK> scenes basically to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing the character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe <UNK> who is one of daytime tv's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie watching him have sex over and over with this girl it's like watching two animals going at it if you're a fan of this actor's talent in other projects don't rent this for you will never view him in the same way if on the other hand you want to see stephen <UNK> have an <UNK> in front of the camera you might like it stephen will show you his naked butt lots of tongue work his <UNK> range but not his talent as this character who's obviously just as sex driven and <UNK> as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera he may have found it kinky but i didn't a big deception
<START> lady and the tramp ii adventure is a cool movie that many kids today can really relate to it's a well presented story about a kid who <UNK> for the freedom to do things his way and how he goes about getting this freedom is only a part of what makes this film interesting just forget the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a point of view because that's just 0 5 or less of the movie's wonderful effect on the viewer great music lively acting talented animation and directing and a powerful storyline tell a tale of the difference between freedom on the streets of new england and a <UNK> home with your family and that no matter how bad things seem your family and friends are always there to help you though any tight spot br br i can't wait to get the soundtrack
<START> i suppose this movie is not your typical spanish thriller as it is based in a real story that took place abroad the movie is based in the real story of french man jean claude and the real case is much more gory and scary than the film in the real story of mr the family didn't escape after years of lies he decided to end it all by killing his wife two children parents and dog and although he tried to kill himself it seems he didn't try very hard as he survived i watched the movie with people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies went <UNK> i was laughing as i had read the book about mr and knew it did happen i like <UNK> in this movie he offered us a good performance as the rest of the crew
<START> well first of all excuse me for the lame pun in the title i was <UNK> for movies to rent the other day and saw this i heard something about this so i picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review <UNK> on it from john fallon aka arrow in the head at that moment i thought well if he likes it then i gotta like it so i rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night college keeps me so busy oh and i might wanna add that i read a little of review and it turns out that out of 4 stars he gave it 1 and a half so my expectations from this movie went from very high to <UNK> well after watching this i once again agree with arrow and turns out that quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about that wow did this film stink or what where do i begin with why it did so well the film was so dull in my opinion not even the cool gore bits excited me and when a <UNK> doesn't <UNK> you in a movie that's bad the characters i hated a lot and from the beginning i could tell who would die and who wouldn't actually the film proved me wrong at some points but the worst thing is that one particular character i wanted to die didn't what the heck and the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met didn't feel it he obviously was just there to be eye candy and give her a love interest otherwise i thought he was a waste and as a horror fan i should know that doing the dumb horror movie sometimes gotta happen or else there wouldn't be much of a movie but the ones in here <UNK> me off hello why are you making out in the room of the killer nun when you should be on the <UNK> from her and it was done by the supposedly smarter characters no less the twist ah it would have been alright if it hadn't been done a billion times and i didn't have to sit through this <UNK> of film to reach that point my main point stupid movie that sucked me in with some words of my favorite actually my only favorite movie critic <UNK>
<START> this movie without doubt is the best i have seen and really shows what british talent can do it's effects are exceedingly good considering the movie is set in the mid 18th century and all the <UNK> and disgusting filth of england at the time is captured very well the character's are developed and fleshed out from <UNK> antics to his development into <UNK> and 'the gentleman contrast well with robert <UNK> who's cynicism and honour show that you can love a thief and a criminal <UNK> i quote got more honour in his little finger than any of you fat <UNK> ' br br not referring to you of course but it has arguably the most stirring and emotionally charged scene ever witnessed in a movie but you'll just have to see it to find out suffice to say that it involves rope round your neck br br
<START> i went into this movie with very little in terms of expectations i went with my girlfriend and two friends and none of them could explain the story of the grudge 1 to me well if the first one couldn't leave an impression on them to explain the plot then i <UNK> this one would be any better br br let me <UNK> what the trailers let you know the asian lady is back and so is sarah michelle <UNK> luckily for her she isn't around very long that decision may have saved her career br br the movie has three story lines and none of them make sense and even worse none of them are developed you almost start to understand and then someone dies and the story gets left behind okay killing people could be scary but i was left more confused over the attempted plot development than i was frightened they jump back and forth between all three story lines which aren't related or are they sound the timing of the three stories are <UNK> and you can tell right at the start that the movie is going to have a twist at the end be oh wait sorry this isn't a fight club or vertigo quality twist you could see this one coming from miles away and probably <UNK> a much better twist in your head they should've hired me instead of the girl making her surprising appearance maybe it could've been michael jackson instead that part of scary movie 4 scared the crap out of me br br the killing sequences were terribly done unlike horror movies of the past where a killer pops out of nowhere a closet or behind a door for example and everyone in the theatre jumps and subsequently the fat guy behind you <UNK> popcorn down your neck this lacked any frightening pop ups they <UNK> in on where the random asian woman or kid would show up and you knew exactly what was coming instead of having the music get really loud then quiet then a pop out to psyche you out the music actually gave you timing for the scary scene if i know it's coming it won't scare me br br the movie began with explaining what the grudge is when a person is killed during a fit of rage a curse is placed on the location where she was killed so why does the asian lady being cursed by her mother have any significance to the story and why is the grudge now moving countries this movie was absolutely terrible br br all it did was leave me <UNK> my friends for making me go we should've seen one of those animated pixar movies it would've been scarier
<START> this belongs in their top <UNK> although there were others such as <UNK> <UNK> and punch <UNK> that were more deserving of oscar nominations than this one but if nothing else the recurring <UNK> <UNK> dr howard dr fine dr howard followed by <UNK> woo woo woo woo makes this a classic on two levels first it <UNK> all that the stooges represent my daughter loves to repeat the <UNK> when she is in the middle of doing something silly second the absurdity of these three as <UNK> in a hospital i imagine the terror i would feel if i were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this <UNK> over the <UNK> throughout this short you hear that <UNK> and you know that something horrible is about to happen and the <UNK> voice stays with you for months afterward
<START> besides the comments on the technical merits of the production or lack thereof the acting is absolutely horrible what is really scary about this movie is that i actually own a copy of it of course it was in a bargain bin and had been <UNK> as dark <UNK> 2 and after having seen it i can understand why it was in the bargain bin they should have paid me for taking it out of their <UNK> br br the majority of the movie if you want to call it that is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field <UNK> looking for his daughters because he has a <UNK> that something is going to happen to them i suspect that the camera that the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco in the <UNK> he runs into the ghost of some children which are poorly done and the movie goes horribly south from there br br i can see why they <UNK> this movie otherwise they would never have gotten rid of them absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through and it wasn't worth the 2 i spent on it
<START> one life stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves its imdb rating of 1 7 doesn't do it justice and is perhaps due to the very few <UNK> it has had rather than the quality of the film itself shot on digital in black and white the film is well directed with production values that <UNK> its <UNK> budget the performances are excellent particularly that of gary lewis who gets better with every role my only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to <UNK> the darker moments overall though it is a fine piece of work
<START> i have been getting into the hitchcock series very much lately i find myself always renting one of his movies when i'm at blockbuster or hollywood video like i said before hollywood is <UNK> it's touch incredibly i needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there not to mention i want to be a film <UNK> not a movie buff is there any better way to do that than with alfred hitchcock's movies br br the man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller starring <UNK> favorite leading man james stuart and the woman who steals the show day they play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son but when a spy tells james some information that could arrest another spy his son is kidnapped and held for <UNK> james seems to just doubt and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick br br the acting again i would say that was the one who <UNK> the whole cast james did a great job keeping up together these two made you sit down and never <UNK> throughout the film i loved the little bit of comedy at the end that alfred added you'll see what i mean i would always highly recommend this film despite not being the best hitchcock film it's still a treasure br br 9 10
<START> the film begins with a <UNK> housewife norma <UNK> finding out that her husband rod la <UNK> had been cheating on her three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity oddly during this time la <UNK> did not see <UNK> or his two kids as <UNK> took them to paris br br marie <UNK> is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved norma to come to her house for the weekend ostensibly to help marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and la <UNK> apparently norma is now a super <UNK> and with her magical sex appeal she can break up the romance and no one seems to realize that she and la <UNK> were married several others are there for the weekend and immediately norma is a hit with her gay <UNK> sexy ways and almost all the men including la <UNK> are captivated by her neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex wants the new and improved norma back this film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper <UNK> similar in some ways to jean <UNK> the rules of the game oddly despite the <UNK> of the depression such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will <UNK> find them a bit too <UNK> in spots however fortunately in let us be gay there are plenty of cute and funny moments particularly towards the end when marie <UNK> shows her true colors while not a great film it certainly is a good one and more than just another time <UNK> my only real regret is that i didn't love the very end you'll just have to see it for yourself perhaps you'll agree about the ending perhaps you won't but i'm pretty sure you will enjoy this clever film
<START> well i'll begin with this i love horror movies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homage br br however the <UNK> humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of c movie crap from 7 and up i know you're joking good one <UNK> because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you can't be for real br br everything worth to be mentioned about the <UNK> has already been summed pretty good up so i'll leave it br br minor spoiler alert br br but the scene where the <UNK> rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog <UNK> for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me
<START> wonderful family film that should be a <UNK> at christmas time it's a mystery to me why it isn't a true lost film that i first encountered <UNK> away on my old 19 black and white <UNK> when the million dollar movie was still in <UNK> on channel 9 in new york city this <UNK> mate directed fantasy should be <UNK> under everyone's christmas tree but it has never been released on home video too bad i believe i saw part of it on <UNK> a few years ago before they cut many of their older films from the <UNK> tcm should take up the slack and play it at <UNK> or on christmas eve any movie with santa aunt <UNK> the <UNK> lady and an actor with the first name king can't be bad ann <UNK> as sally is a <UNK> of energy during her school years she rushes over to the <UNK> to pray for st ann to help and give <UNK> to her mixed up and <UNK> <UNK> family it works so after she <UNK> she places a statue of st ann in her own bedroom at one point the entire <UNK> is moved to another address i think this was done to put an end to a neighbor <UNK> between the and the <UNK> fellow next door <UNK> is cute as a button edmund <UNK> can play the <UNK> grandfather in his sleep all in all this is a satisfying movie experience
<START> cage plays a drunk and gets high <UNK> praise elizabeth <UNK> actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in hollywood i literally <UNK> while watching this film of course i had the <UNK> but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the br br why can't nick cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor nick cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor heck nobody could do it better br br the search begins for <UNK> contract with <UNK> or was it lou <UNK> from night train to terror
<START> this movie is wonderful i can watch it again and again robin hood is perfectly cast and <UNK> is beautiful i personally think german man is the funniest character along with <UNK> and the sheriff while space balls got boring and stupid after a while this one always keeps your interest w o n d e r f u l this was a great film and never gets boring a great cast is in the roles and it is <UNK> perfectly and makes so much sense and can be watched again and again you will love this film if you'll only watch it except if you hate comedy or does not think robin hood should be <UNK> with but this old story gets boring and this movie gives it a great new flavor
<START> almost a <UNK> in how not to direct a movie from the <UNK> often incomprehensible script <UNK> dr <UNK> builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over <UNK> <UNK> and middle aged and the men are young vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex the director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances br br there is certainly a great deal of <UNK> going on <UNK> <UNK> slips into a pale <UNK> of her bullets over broadway performance and poor old jane <UNK> <UNK> in her attempt to give a comic performance though you have to pity her as there is very little real comedy here the whole thing feels like a very low rent version of <UNK> le divorce which to be quite honest wasn't very good either
<START> i did not enjoy the film <UNK> whatsoever it's awful acting boring storyline and average special effects made this an annoying arnie film as it had a mountain of potential with other action films of the time <UNK> fell very short
<START> i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy i have seen her in kiss me kate and victor victoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is a <UNK> who can play and sing anything br br i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding <UNK> performance in lucy even some <UNK> tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy my response to that is so what i wasn't looking for a superficial <UNK> of lucy i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth i also didn't want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits <UNK> and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart i also thought rachel was <UNK> fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were <UNK> the professor and the <UNK> <UNK> in particular there was one moment in the <UNK> scene where the corner of <UNK> mouth had the exact little <UNK> that i remember lucy having i couldn't believe she was able to capture that and so naturally br br i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right <UNK> for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept <UNK> what would prove to be her ultimate gifts br br i believe that rachel <UNK> captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and <UNK> that was totally endearing lucy was a star turn for rachel york i hope it brings a <UNK> of great roles her way in the future i also hope it brings her an emmy
<START> if you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth 15 park <UNK> is the story of an alternative reality of a <UNK> the movie is about her search for her home at a <UNK> address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live <UNK> delivers yet another masterpiece each and every actor of the movie was better than the other <UNK> <UNK> looks unbelievably convincing as a <UNK> she pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age <UNK> <UNK> is incredible as usual she plays the <UNK> and <UNK> independent elder sister of who takes care of her <UNK> sister and aging mother she refuses to accept that in spite of all her strength and courage she still feels lonely at times this should have been a very easy movie for <UNK> the role was least bit demanding and anyone could have done the role br br the ending of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole park <UNK> experience it took me a while to <UNK> that the movie had ended it left me confused and maybe even a bit disturbed but later on it started sinking in my eyes are black but if everyone says they are blue will i still believe that its black
<START> this woman is a terrible comedian she can't crack a joke she has no real character this is another example of typical american rubbish that people laugh at because they have no idea how to react so they say to themselves well it's a comedy show so i'll laugh i guess br br i cannot stand this miserable woman and her <UNK> poor excuse for comedy she does not deserve anything but <UNK> br br why can't america dump this kind of delight and go for something that actually contains humour br br she is not funny not at all why oh why does even one person like this idiot
<START> this movie was horrible and it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie the way i look at it it's more like three mediocre day time disney cartoon episodes strung loosely together to make a single video that pretends to be the sequel to the first atlantis movie which was way more well made and enjoyable and where do i even begin with the problems of this dvd the story the characters the pictures animation to me they're all bad and unwatchable firstly the story in this direct to video dvd is ridiculous and pointless the only good thing about it is that it is consistent that is consistently bad from the beginning to the end after the film's over i still don't know why milo has returned and how the incidents occur in the three small stories are related to each other or to atlantis itself and all i could remember about this movie was how bad it makes me feel after seeing it the characters feel wooden and lack personality and the drawings look a lot different than that in the first you can tell they're obviously not from the hands of the same animators from the first one as the dvd played on i found myself caring less and less about what might happen to the characters and just hoping the film would end soon besides the story and the characters mentioned above the picture quality is poor in this one too probably one of the worst in those direct to video products that disney has ever released as a fan of the the original atlantis the lost empire i couldn't be more disappointed in <UNK> return which is a total waste of time and money thank goodness i rented it first instead of buying it even so i still wish i'd never seen this crap or even known its existence
<START> i'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because i really liked this film if you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring ben idiot affleck or some other hollywood loser it's an intellectual film you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that however if you are looking for something that keeps you on your <UNK> then this is a good choice warning to parents it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the <UNK> are in bed people who like euro flicks will like this one adam sandler fans should skip it because it will be over their heads and definitely not their style
<START> this film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to make family entertainment meaning something which is enjoyable to people of all ages this particular wallace <UNK> can be enjoyed by everyone from <UNK> who like the colors and cute <UNK> to their grandparents who understand the adult references br br this film has direction as good as any i've ever seen and i mean that literally it is also packed with tiny bits of humor and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that i'm going to have to buy it if only in order to read all the signs and in w <UNK> world br br i plan to see this movie at least twice more in theaters then buy it on dvd you too should see it
<START> i can't believe people are giving bad reviews about this movie i wonder why maybe because of the book i have to admit it really doesn't follow the book for sure the book by dean <UNK> is much better but the movie is also good as well it has the suspense the acting are good especially michael <UNK> whom have given a superb acting in this movie br br come one give this movie a chance there are still lot more worse movie than this like sum of all fears <UNK> the da <UNK> code this are some of the worse movie i have seen really boring if compared to <UNK> which really have great elements in the movie this movie contains great suspense and non stop action i'm looking for this movie but it is really hard to be found on dvd br br by da way i really recommended this movie to everybody watch it you will never regret br br 10 10
<START> i use princess <UNK> to give the film its not quite accurate english title as a <UNK> test for my <UNK> sense of humour it either leaves them cold and <UNK> as it clearly did several other <UNK> on this site or results in <UNK> up laughter huge <UNK> and occasional <UNK> of admiration br br the laughter comes from the film's <UNK> mixture of parodies in contemporary style targets include a <UNK> of japanese and western classical stage drama forms from <UNK> to late <UNK> and spanish renaissance christian fantasy the <UNK> <UNK> of the modern american and european musical as witness a host of random tap and rap dance songs and some very funny banal lyrics all choreographed with loving amateur cliché japanese anime and samurai live action clichés <UNK> <UNK> ritual and the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> i've not laughed out loud so much at this type of film since ken <UNK> outrageous musical <UNK> in the boyfriend br br the <UNK> come from the clever <UNK> <UNK> of the japanese legend told in a traditional 5 act structure reminiscent of the plays of the <UNK> century master as in his work the narrative is advanced in a mixture of song high <UNK> poetry and low comedy relief here the pot <UNK> of the incompetent ninja <UNK> by <UNK> under the illusion that he is a <UNK> in human <UNK> all of this somehow does hang together and even more remarkably does manage to engage the <UNK> emotions through the of cultural references br br in truth princess <UNK> wears its pan cultural <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and that's where the <UNK> of <UNK> come in visually again as with <UNK> masterpiece the film is a treat a riot of colour with its <UNK> backdrops of classical japanese images from screens and <UNK> over the top costumes and stage sets mixed with some breathtaking live action sequences in summer fields and you'll love it or <UNK> it but there's no point <UNK> for being cheese and princess <UNK> stands first and foremost as a <UNK> funny as well as <UNK> put down of our contemporary cultural <UNK> in both east and west bravo
<START> as far as i am concerned this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film <UNK> i am used to viewing 1 the setting is paris france 2 there is 28 minute scene with no dialog br br both make this movie a bit unique at least to english speaking film noir fans actually an american jules shot the film so it's not entirely a european film initially i was disappointed in this after i had watched the first 40 minutes it's an expensive dvd and i was bored however once that silent segment started the actual heist you already know what's it about the film picked up considerably and just got better and better br br in fact i thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist the best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography this is what makes the disc worth <UNK> it's excellent film noir photography and a real <UNK> for those of us who have never seen paris and this is paris in the mid 1950s there are lots of bleak but interesting rain <UNK> paris streets and buildings i found fascinating to view in fact there were many more of those great shots than of london in the much better known film the third man br br the lead actor in here jean i think his name is also is interesting to view someone described his face as a cross between <UNK> bogart and harry dean <UNK> and that sums it up perfectly a warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film this is france not the united states so there is a little bit of both in here i appreciate the dvd offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version too
<START> a bit the movie in the movie case or as the theme is virtual game here which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the real one as any <UNK> there are <UNK> things like the <UNK> and that wonderful idea the <UNK> gun a weapon made of bones and <UNK> that shoots teeth if there are some slower moments the sets designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution can be not liked because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing but it's definitely worth it
<START> homicide the movie proved to be a good wrap up to a well written well directed and well acted series loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season the entire series and especially the movie provided a life like look at life and death in <UNK> a <UNK> unique city with an extremely high murder rate my attraction to the series began long before i moved to <UNK> but once i experienced life here for myself i realized how realistic it was and the movie certainly <UNK> that spirit i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city
<START> the first ever fully <UNK> sound cartoon walt disney's mickey mouse makes his screen debut in the exceptionally entertaining cartoon short subject <UNK> willie mickey is a worker on a <UNK> under the <UNK> of captain <UNK> leg pete or pete as he would later be called mickey boards his long time companion <UNK> mouse aboard the train as they <UNK> about while mickey attempts to impress <UNK> this short was wildly fun and positively entertaining animators <UNK> <UNK> and hugh <UNK> <UNK> walt on the creation of the short <UNK> willie essentially marks the beginning of the success of the walt disney company
<START> especially when looking at the amount of crap that has made it to dvd i found this movie very funny rip torn is classic with his <UNK> rob schneider if hilariously annoying as the over <UNK> <UNK> bruce dern makes a great villain the entire cast seems to be having a blast and it's not at the expense of the audience if you like just plain fun comedy and aren't looking too deeply into meaning you just might fall in love with this one
<START> one of the greatest crimes made against sci fi television was the <UNK> of <UNK> one of the most well written well acted and over all best shows ever to grace the <UNK> it set new standards for sci fi television once the <UNK> highest rated <UNK> show of the sci fi channel it defies <UNK> as to why shows like buffy tremors the series and even stargate sg 1 have lasted as long as they have yes even buffy but i'll save my buffy bashing for another time <UNK> was poorly treated by the sci fi channel continually tossed around in <UNK> reruns rarely shown and never really advertised but while the show has been cancelled all those involved in the production of the show want to bring the show back even <UNK> company <UNK> brian <UNK> there is also an extensive fan based movement to bring the show back overall things are looking far from dark and hopefully fans will get their season 5
<START> all i can say is i really miss this show my wife i just got married around the time this show started up why did cbs take it off the air i think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy it made me laugh it also made me cry but when cbs took it off the air my wife i thought cbs made a big mistake you know what would be so great have a reunion show that would be so cool anybody know if it is on dvd yet on the last season of promised land did cbs show the whole last season i think cbs took it off the air at mid season my wife i will never forget it the opening with that theme song was fantastic this show only comes once in a life time may we never forget promised land
<START> i guess this is in the public <UNK> as its out on dvd first off this is a feel good propaganda movie to be shown to a wartime aussie audience so its not to be considered a serious retelling of <UNK> the first half to 3 4 is very dry stuff set in australia i guess like many american war films where the <UNK> are getting together oh man its <UNK> long than we get to africa and <UNK> pretty bad low budget stuff the battle scenes on the dvd copy i watched were almost completely black see it if you must but be prepared to use the fast forward as i doubt you can take it after a few minutes i enjoyed the cheesy italian battle of el a whole lot more also richard burton did an african theater war flick that was good the desert rats this movie is just a real period piece and should have stayed in that time does not hold up well today i doubt it was highly regarded back then either i say the same thing about my american counterpart war flicks so don't take it personally <UNK> i love australia been there twice
<START> this is the <UNK> <UNK> film tom <UNK> has lost none of his humour and style and is not showing signs of getting tired the film has a very satisfying story with lots of red herrings suspects and <UNK> <UNK> meredith is the good girl of the story she plays it adequately but by no means sets the screen on fire myrna <UNK> is a bad girl and she puts on an excellent face of stone with eyes of and you are just waiting for her to kill as many people as possible to cheer herself up edward <UNK> is back as goldie the sidekick but surprise surprise his manic over acting has stopped and he is actually under control this is a fine tribute to the directorial skills of william a who had done so many westerns he probably was not prepared to take any nonsense from a brooklyn <UNK> the result is that for the first time possibly in his career <UNK> was toned down enough actually to add something to a film rather than try the viewer's patience with the irritating behaviour of a retarded but <UNK> six year old it all goes along very well and is thoroughly entertaining
<START> for once a sequel to the karate kid without ralph <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> did an excellent job playing the orphan julie pierce pat <UNK> the one who plays mr <UNK> worked his way with julie quite different from daniel both daniel and julie <UNK> karate unlike daniel julie was the most <UNK> person <UNK> ever challenged and there was no <UNK> to compete in and there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well i liked the part where when julie came home from school <UNK> went to check on her and saw her change clothes in the process that was very funny and the classic wax on wax off scene was different as well it was funny when <UNK> tells julie uh oh missed spot the set in boston was a far cry from california the <UNK> group in that group was like the <UNK> <UNK> in boston and michael <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was no john his group practically deserted him when julie kicked some serious butt they all paid the price when they blew up that classic what a cowardly act at least they'll find redemption from poison this karate kid sets some morals unlike the last three which talked about honor and respect <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> hot in any movie and everything else she does movie 9 <UNK> <UNK> 10
<START> this is one of the great modern kung fu films a lot of the reviews seem to miss the point that the comedy is based on a quite subtle at times at other times right in your face contrast between old and new china <UNK> <UNK> for instance is called a country <UNK> and gets into trouble whenever she tries to adapt to the new but in the end to save her families honour dresses as an old fashioned heroine in contrast to the modern military style of <UNK> ho gordon liu seems to have played his part for laughs playing off his serious monk persona with silly <UNK> and a guitar the end fight is simply fantastic and ends in a defeat for johnny wang rather than death <UNK> <UNK> moon should be mentioned for his great playing of a thug with simply terrific and <UNK> <UNK> does some magnificent acting and fighting a great film
<START> i always wanted to see this film and when i finally got to i knew i was in for a nice surprise when john <UNK> name appeared on the screen known mostly for his epic films he directed the first conan and wrote apocalypse now put together in the classic hollywood structure this one fits nicely with his <UNK> br br i also can't express how perfect the timing was considering that <UNK> is once again experiencing an <UNK> by monks and students against the military <UNK> run government which is the very same one there has been a change of <UNK> since but it's essentially the same depicted in the movie from 1988 now more than ever this film needs to be aired on television caught it on <UNK> because of recent events
<START> these immortal lines begin the jack directed masterpiece 'the <UNK> <UNK> the plot centers around two blue collar west brothers <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> forrest who commit <UNK> in hopes of using the money to open a <UNK> restaurant what follows is quite an adventure and many comedic events ensue the action scenes are all top notch and consist of some nicely realized <UNK> the latter of which is absolutely amazing and occurs in an abandoned building being <UNK> by a <UNK> ball the film was written by now famous director <UNK> <UNK> and features an early appearance by <UNK> <UNK> all in all an excellent hidden gem of the 70s and easily one of the finest action comedy <UNK> every made hopefully it gets a decent widescreen dvd release soon
<START> this film is definitely up there with the worst films i've ever seen probably in my top 5 of worst films i laughed once and that was when br br <UNK> im building something <UNK> secretary i hope its a <UNK> shop br br that was literally the only time i laughed in this <UNK> awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fan wasn't even that great br br this movie lacked the humour of having god's powers and was more about family bonding id class it solely as a family movie definitely not a family comedy br br seeing a bird poo on someone's shirt is not hilarious neither is a beard that grows back instant br br i didn't even think the special effects were great the animals looked really stuck on it was like watching a film which hadn't been together properly br br 2 10 film avoid
<START> i bought this movie from a market <UNK> three years ago i gotta hand it to you when i sat down and watched it i thought this is gonna be another big action b movie ' obviously i was wrong while watching this film i began to realise that this movie was taking me to another planet full of <UNK> p br br i began to get really bored and fed up with this film although i wanted to see was gonna happen in the end i really felt like it was really getting on my nerves br br the people behind the film <UNK> brought some well known name actors into this project but what were they thinking even these actors couldn't save this film br br at the end of the film i felt like this was a waste of money just buying this low life sucker of film for a small amount of money a few months later i sent the tape off to charity i didn't want to see it again br br sorry but if you're thinking of watching a movie and then <UNK> off to sleep i can highly recommend it you me i'll rather go on pro plus and watch something decent br br disappointing 1 out of 10
<START> even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan i found this film to be beyond awful it was a huge disappointment since it was featured as one of the eight <UNK> films i can only hope the other seven were better i was actually embarrassed for the friends i was able to convince to see this and these are the same friends i made watch the remake of the wicker man it has every cliché in the book in fact it went out of its way to include them let's start with the characters instead of one young damsel in distress we get three the single hot mom with two a <UNK> yet brainless teenager and a cute yet simultaneously creepy little girl that you just know is going to have <UNK> skills including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead the little girl is the same one that was in the remake of the <UNK> horror she was a little annoying but not nearly as irritating <UNK> fanning br br overall these characters seemed like <UNK> from a lifetime movie i thought perhaps horror movies had moved on from scenes where the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark <UNK> their presence to anyone with ears but not this one i also find it <UNK> that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door from <UNK> opening day and night to give you an idea about how <UNK> i was with these characters i spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the set because everyone was in a coat even in their houses and how white their teeth were br br despite all the formulaic plot <UNK> the film does not build any suspense at all except to wonder when it will be over there is more atmosphere at the local giant in the middle of the most mundane of <UNK> <UNK> as for the dialogue i could have <UNK> quotes from ten other films and <UNK> together better more believable <UNK> the gore level the eye candy for a horror fan was minimal at best without their tiny weapons the <UNK> were not menacing at all you could probably drop kick a couple of them across the room br br what really kills it is its <UNK> horror films more than any other genre cannot survive uninspired mediocrity give me a horror movie that is <UNK> inept or outrageously over the top with gore i can even take the new ones with their cringe inducing torture every once in a while i'd appreciate a truly frightening one anything but this
<START> be warned of possible spoilers br br a friend told me to check out this series and i'm glad i took her words for it br br i read the synopsis on the dvd cover and i was immediately intrigued the main protagonist is muslim no way this is a first it's about an fbi agent who is under deep cover to <UNK> a possible sleeper cell in la and get this he is a practicing muslim i was a little skeptical at first half expecting some hero or the antagonist to <UNK> maybe silly gratuitous and mindless <UNK> than <UNK> fanatic let's face it a lot of shows have been guilty of this br br but then i watched the first three episodes and i thought okay this is good it wasn't until episode four <UNK> when i was well and truly impressed i would like to <UNK> on the great writing and also superb performances from the actors i just love how complex every one of these characters they're not straight out two dimensional cardboard <UNK> good guys bad guys michael gives a wonderful and believable performance as the muslim fbi agent al <UNK> the fine line between being the good muslim and being a man with flaws gives his character an interesting depth is not the typical <UNK> middle eastern stereotype but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesn't see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme <UNK> to justify his beliefs he's very charismatic and <UNK> but i would say that it was alex performance that clearly left an impression in me in <UNK> his portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was amazing torn between the <UNK> spoken words of a muslim <UNK> <UNK> him to return to the non aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in god's eye and <UNK> to believe otherwise br br i'm looking forward to watch more shows like this and not some ridiculously high <UNK> one man show series it's clever and open minded
<START> i don't like boxing don't understand the attraction i did like this movie positive portrayals of <UNK> with no drugs sex or street violence the plot actually showed stable loving families the fight sequences are violent as is boxing but not as over the top as rocky films nothing wrong with attempting familiar themes with a different angle and <UNK> it's a good rent
<START> late one night on tom <UNK> tomorrow show i watched tom ask his guest henry morgan what he considered to be <UNK> ' morgan <UNK> anything with glenda jackson and although i wouldn't consider this film to be perfect it does bear out that notion very well i was about to use the <UNK> about hollywood not making pictures like this anymore but then i just saw up in the air another intelligent film about 2 people over the age of 35 who fall in love that's where the similarities end though house calls is just sheer fun watching 2 pros like matthau and jackson hit it off and seem completely natural while they're at it i saw this film in the theater in 1978 at the <UNK> old age of 18 and it took me another 20 years to get all of the jokes any film that can make punch lines out of <UNK> <UNK> great bill and british prime minister <UNK> chamberlain wouldn't play too well at the <UNK> these days one other thought the original theatrical release featured a on the beach fall in <UNK> montage set to the beatles george harrison tune something it seemed a bit forced at the time but that song has since been <UNK> out for a rather generic henry <UNK> music cue for subsequent home video and cable release too bad because that scene just lays there now another victim of music <UNK> hell
<START> i saw this film early one morning in the early 90s when i was about 12 i have been trying to find what it was and finally today i did i remember enjoying it and being a little bit freaked out at the ending when it showed the <UNK> of the young boy and his ghostly face please could anybody let me no if i can get a copy of this as i would love to see it again i remember the kid getting stuck down a <UNK> tin mine and then <UNK> a boy cant remember that the kids were stuck there with <UNK> but must have been the boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who had died while working down there i think
<START> i've felt that rupert has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him so even though i had never heard of this film before when it appeared in my cable tv <UNK> i immediately switched to that channel i am so happy that i did br br i've read from other reviewers that they don't generally like coming of age stories i on the other hand quite do i am one of those who is always coming of age i have been since i was 12 i'm <UNK> now and i will probably continue until i'm <UNK> coming of age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings the <UNK> of the realization the <UNK> of it sometimes throws us into <UNK> if we try to shelter our delicate <UNK> from that then yes i can see how the coming of age can end but if we simply dust ourselves off and settle into the new direction we've discovered then we're all of a sudden on a new path and we're just as alive as we were yesterday only stronger <UNK> and i <UNK> more interesting br br so that's what this movie was about this was a coming of age story all the way round young ben his father father robert and certainly dame all went through a marvelous transformation in fact so too did mr didn't he all did i suspect except in fact the mother in spite of her enormous opportunity so to do provided by the events of the end of the film one is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path she's been on only with perhaps a different supporting cast br br so an excellent film that could not possibly have been made in america which is utterly depressing to think about but thank god we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see i really <UNK> recommend this film so long as you don't mind cringing through those parts of it that are all too familiar to us all and <UNK> through all the rest of it
<START> can't grade this very well because i can't say i liked it but it is the story that bothered me not the realization of the film the acting directing atmosphere music were all good it's just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you can't truly relate to the movie ends it is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings don't need to make any sense at all and still be strong but that's about it br br the plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet dylan thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex girlfriend he is married brings his wife and later the kid while the ex knightley marries some other guy but the tension is there dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of <UNK> add in some pretty <UNK> characters and you have your hands full br br bottom line you have to be in the mood to like this film the hard part is defining this mood i don't think i've ever been in it yet ever so it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about dylan thomas
<START> i must admit that i am a fan of cheesy <UNK> cartoons but this is among the best <UNK> and the star <UNK> is one of the most watchable and entertaining of the <UNK> cartoons and is much better than the tv series i especially like the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> and find it very amusing my favorite character though is who is definitely the most magnificent horse in the universe br br i also recommend <UNK> new <UNK> which tells the story of how came to be have a <UNK> day
<START> i appear to be in the minority on this one but i found one true thing to be <UNK> contrived and generally unpleasant not that the acting was all that bad but the characters seemed little more than <UNK> the bad father oh but wait maybe he's not <UNK> bad maybe there can be a resolution at the end admittedly the woman i was with loved the movie so maybe you'll like it but i didn't
<START> the seven ups is a good and engrossing film it's packed with credible performances by <UNK> and an effective scary performance by richard lynch although most of the characters are card board cut out tough guys character development does not <UNK> at all on the screen the only thing we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad <UNK> from the crime story norm the seven ups manage to throw <UNK> and crew into the middle of a building plot in a unique writing twist locations of new york city and an excellent choreographed car chase highlight the film the only downside of the film is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning they give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are mob related until later in the film had someone <UNK> started watching the film may be slightly confused on the story otherwise the seven ups is a gritty <UNK> filled enjoyable time
<START> the <UNK> adventure br br there are some movies that i could watch all my life and never grow tired of them and this nostalgic favorite is one of them the <UNK> adventure was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the <UNK> of animation this time on the big screen in an age when disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office the <UNK> adventure stands as one of the best animated films that disney didn't produce in the 80's br br the story is simple and <UNK> having alvin simon theodore compete in an around the world race with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however as the <UNK> encounter exotic dangers they are unaware that they are the <UNK> in a major diamond heist br br the <UNK> adventure never was and never will be a film that <UNK> thanks to an engrossing plot and to people who didn't love it as a child the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable yet forgettable animated movie but for me it will always be a little known masterpiece something about the film just <UNK> for me in a way few films do br br every song is fun upbeat and harmless highlights include the in a slightly <UNK> <UNK> dance to calm snakes there's also a very sweet song in which the <UNK> sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major <UNK> throughout the globe one thing about the <UNK> characters is that despite the potentially annoying <UNK> the <UNK> always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating this film is no exception it actually boasts one of the best animated movie <UNK> of the 80's if you ask me br br every joke is cute sincere and amusing the bits between the bad guys and a <UNK> puppy are very amusing and the shock of seeing the nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well the comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they don't miss anything but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained br br it's really just a fun trip that is completely humble in it's ambitions the <UNK> adventure never aims to be anything more then it is harmless fun i'll be the first to admit this is a biased review because i have such a nostalgic <UNK> for the <UNK> adventure that i would never be able to give it a bad review but nonetheless it fills me with such a childish <UNK> while watching it everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows and for me it's this movie and any film that i can watch over and over whether i am 5 12 23 or older is a great film in my eyes br br a
<START> i've never seen a movie get a worse release then this and that's a shame as this is the funniest film of the year you would think an ad with the line from the director of office space would be enough to warrant a big release but there are no ads no posters no website i doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend what is 20th century fox thinking mike <UNK> sci fi comedy is set in but it could come true in about 10 years if things continue as they are luke wilson and <UNK> <UNK> get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of <UNK> zombie <UNK> <UNK> the film reminds me of woody allen's sleeper <UNK> planet of the apes blade runner and network and the late great <UNK> try to see it before fox burns all the <UNK>
<START> a terrific comedy drama about the powers of friendship despite it's a remake of a 1939 film of the same title it would probably be compared to sex and the city i would not compare to it totally the story starts with mary meg ryan who seems to the life most women would envy she's happily married has a good daughter great friends and a great home but perfect life isn't what it seems when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with crystal eve <UNK> from <UNK> mary is puzzled and doesn't know what to do but her four good friends sylvia <UNK> <UNK> edie debra messing and alex <UNK> <UNK> smith try to be there for her in anyway they can i really don't want to give anymore away but i found this enjoyable and i'm a man meg ryan is great it is nice to see her in on the screen again after a series of <UNK> and the rest of the cast are also great including eve <UNK> as crystal just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy
<START> i saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since i have the dvd it's one of drew <UNK> best works and one that is worth seeing more than once br br not being popular in high school was one f the things in the film i could relate to i wasn't quite as tortured as <UNK> was during her real high school days or like but i was never the go to the major party type either the prom scene were the three popular girls fall victim to their own prank as <UNK> pushes way the intended victim is my favorite scene and i <UNK> when i first saw it br br i can still watch this movie today it is excellent
<START> this movie was funny from start to finish everyone in the cinema was laughing out loud throughout the film the best characters were alex fisher <UNK> <UNK> edie cohen debra messing the girl from will and grace and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> they had the best lines the best attitudes etc <UNK> <UNK> playing a lesbian was really funny she really played it well and was very convincing the only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters weren't as funny even though the movie focused around them all in all this is a great movie to go and see with your girls yes guys it's a <UNK> movie through and through enjoy
<START> nbc was putting out a lot of good product when this series came out but none of it was getting viewers at least according to their executives who wisely canceled good shows like star trek my world welcome to it because of low ratings <UNK> <UNK> were getting a bargain from <UNK> ignorance br br this show stands out as the only time james garner wasn't enough to get viewers it is <UNK> as this show had an excellent support cast from stuart <UNK> later angel in the <UNK> files to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> br br it was set in a <UNK> western town garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use violence to do his duties it was small town stuff but it was excellent it wasn't long after this that jim <UNK> brought garner back to success but for my money this show was good enough it just wasn't in the right time right place or given the right opportunity br br the show was so good that most of the folks who worked on it also got jobs on <UNK>
<START> the sad thing about <UNK> is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life what is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny br br the <UNK> team in series one consists of brian thompson bruno lawrence a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets occasionally his stunts to achieve these ratings see him run in with his line producer emma thompson alison a woman who hasn't lost all her <UNK> integrity and is prepared to defend moral <UNK> on occasions the same cannot be said of reporter brooke <UNK> jane kennedy a reporter who has had all the substance sucked out of her so much so that when <UNK> ben <UNK> she needs to be <UNK> to laugh her reports usually consist of <UNK> celebrities with whom she has or hasn't with before or <UNK> <UNK> reports that usually <UNK> martin de <UNK> is the reporter with whom the team relies on for <UNK> and dignity as he has the <UNK> of 21 years of <UNK> behind him his doesn't have principles so much as a <UNK> of what makes a good <UNK> story though he does draw the occasional line <UNK> over this chaos in name is mike moore rob an <UNK> naive reporter who can't see that he's only a pretty face for the <UNK> <UNK> he often finds his morals being <UNK> simply because brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest br br <UNK> is the sort of show that there needs to be more of because it shows that while in modern times happiness safety and deep political insight are interesting things it's much easier to rate with scandal fear and <UNK> celebrities
<START> hey community my question is about the song the pizza man wants <UNK> to play right after smoking that <UNK> not his <UNK> song but the <UNK> one thanks br br this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing br br hey community my question is about the song the pizza man wants <UNK> to play right after smoking that <UNK> not his <UNK> song but the <UNK> one thanks br br this page wants me to write 10 lines of text to be allowed to submit my comment i don't know what else to ask but i'm just writing writing writing
<START> i only wish there was a grade lower than f to give it i scored it a 1 in the vote <UNK> i am <UNK> this not even as a regular film but as a t a film and this is the worst <UNK> <UNK> and most awful movie i've seen the acting story and music are all terrible not to mention there isn't even any nudity for the t a it's about a male <UNK> and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers avoid this piece of trash at all cost this is the worst of bad 80's teen cinema
<START> i wanted to like this movie but there is very little to like about it it starts out with jean <UNK> and a randy newman song in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i guess reminiscent of norman cold turkey which was one of the best movies ever made according to people on imdb so far so good and the idea of the <UNK> michael living at <UNK> motel on earth well give it a chance it's supposed to be a comedy okay so far so good but michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had the other characters in the movie don't have much appeal either michael brings a dog back to life and we're supposed to be in awe of that the people make up corny country songs in the end <UNK> dances with travolta big deal if she was smart she wouldn't even be in this movie when it was over i thought gee what a stupid tasteless boring corny <UNK> movie it's not fit to be seen by children or anyone else
<START> i bought the dvd to get julia <UNK> well i got that in <UNK> she was lovely in the romantic scenes too bad bill paxton was flying on <UNK> for the whole effort i almost lost my lunch when he popped his big fat white behind out of his flight suit to shall we say with julia br br i realized julia was very <UNK> in french while watching her in <UNK> i watched <UNK> with the french soundtrack to see if julia dubbed her own dialog they used someone else in any case julia was chosen for this dutch film over a native french <UNK> with sufficient english to communicate with the american <UNK> perhaps they wanted at least one familiar name for the british american market to my unfamiliar eye <UNK> features could pass for <UNK> br br the whole film had an odd nature it was a dutch film about <UNK> in world war 2 i would imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic dutch resistance to the german <UNK> the <UNK> were much more passive during the <UNK> period than were the french or <UNK> the most savage fighting of all came in the <UNK> where <UNK> communist <UNK> gave the germans fits br br i noted in another review that believed julia <UNK> to be an american instead of the actual british <UNK> perhaps <UNK> acting skills were great enough to carry off that impression br br after watching this film several times it suddenly <UNK> on me how out of season the film is it is set on 16 1944 when the american plane crashes in <UNK> farm country the trees look to be in mid fall with lots of leaves and the weather is warm people walk about in light clothing and the grass is still green there is not the smallest trace of snow or ice this must have been the <UNK> winter in <UNK> ever br br the actual plot of the film was a mess where to begin for anyone interested in world war 2 history the film came across as farce the <UNK> plane used was a huge 4 engine converted <UNK> such aircraft did exist but they would have required massive fighter <UNK> to have any chance of survival in reality smaller and aircraft were readily available and would have been far more suitable for the task the vital code books in the film would never have been carried on the plane the crew had no need of this information to complete their mission while compromise of this information would have been a huge intelligence defeat even given the premise of the film the first items to be stripped from the aircraft would be the code books they would have been on their way to berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of german troops at the crash site br br the home where <UNK> took <UNK> was a farm where no one had the least interest in <UNK> food would have been very <UNK> in <UNK> at this time the germans would have required substantial <UNK> of <UNK> produced food to support their forces the family truck would have been long before the arrival of the american <UNK> there would not have been any fuel available to run it anyway br br the plot twist where <UNK> turns in the american out of jealousy is pathetic he would have had to reveal all he knew about the resistance in order to be allowed to live he would have had to function as a double agent to <UNK> any effective opposition the woman with the secret radio would have never survived the war br br <UNK> was caught in <UNK> clothing toward the end of the film that made him a spy under the laws of war and <UNK> for execution with no defense he would not have <UNK> <UNK> to face <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> convention better to force them to kill him and spare his friends if possible br br i have not read the novel upon which this film is based if this film is a faithful adaption it shows an abysmal lack of development in the novel regardless of the novel the screenwriters could easily have produced a superior script that would not waste this opportunity to deliver a much better film
<START> someone commented that charlie <UNK> character should be court <UNK> for doing whatever he wanted you may be right but that is how truly are i served for several months with a seal team out of <UNK> <UNK> actually i should say they used our ship to <UNK> themselves around europe for a couple of months i was the <UNK> clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we <UNK> one pass to one person each day a different seal would come up pretending to be someone else well after the third time i said no to them until i had proof who they were they went nuts i thought they were gonna bust through my cage gag me and then steal the mail luckily i had not only the president on my side the navy but the federal government us mail that was the only time i saw the <UNK> stopped from having whatever they wanted they were allowed <UNK> shore leave where we had to be back on ship at a certain time they killed and tortured a woman in france and the two only got a 1 week <UNK> on ship whereas a <UNK> was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a french wine shop and he got a court martial is it any wonder why the <UNK> rate is over 85 as a seal you are god so this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a seal acts and thinks unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake
<START> despite decades of tax <UNK> in terms of international <UNK> the canadian film industry still <UNK> behind most central african and <UNK> states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native <UNK> and <UNK> france aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other <UNK> failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising there's certainly a rich vein of <UNK> material in <UNK> history as the french and english <UNK> over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blink and you'll miss it scene of characters saying <UNK> is dead or <UNK> france is no more before getting back to the soap but while this isn't a history lesson it isn't a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of <UNK> by a half dozen re and one <UNK> shed the town square that is all we ever see of <UNK> is a rather obvious <UNK> lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean <UNK> to offer much in the way of long shots or even <UNK> what you do get for your money is a simple but drawn out <UNK> romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that <UNK> doesn't turn up in the cast it's the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging <UNK> or <UNK> br br an <UNK> canadian french co production that doesn't so much <UNK> once <UNK> nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the <UNK> this massive box office disaster was clearly intended to be <UNK> titanic though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that <UNK> to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the <UNK> mirror described it as so bad that one can't even find the strength to mock it that's rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a below par 80s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps <UNK> husbands <UNK> you'll never see your handsome lover again honor you'll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and gasp witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in <UNK> moore's version of the scarlet letter throw in british <UNK> <UNK> slaves and celine <UNK> singing at the end and you've got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that <UNK> hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his <UNK> inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the <UNK> technical incompetence br br leading man david la <UNK> seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly <UNK> the al pacino revolution look <UNK> with the clean <UNK> <UNK> style before turning into a younger ted <UNK> as his character ages while his opening scene where he <UNK> to news of his father's death with an expression that looks like he's waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor who's <UNK> into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and <UNK> he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isn't there <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> leading lady doesn't exactly set the screen <UNK> either despite <UNK> center stage as the <UNK> girl who is the prey of <UNK> vincent corrupt and perverted le <UNK> that really is the character's name the <UNK> drunken <UNK> <UNK> and saddest of all gerard <UNK> <UNK> revolutionary dirty old priest in a <UNK> grey haired wig it's a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he <UNK> through the motions looking like he's not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldn't be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very <UNK> <UNK> small wonder he talked of <UNK> around the time of the film's brief release br br some brief comic relief is provided by jason <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> mode who <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> rather like an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played by timothy dalton on speed while tim <UNK> william pitt stands on the <UNK> with the occasional <UNK> smile of one who's being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like <UNK> <UNK> benjamin franklin they're both in the film for less than three minutes <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene <UNK> looking for all the world like a young <UNK> <UNK> are all <UNK> good and deserve much better
<START> it's impossible to make a film based on such a book as the brothers by f m br br richard brooks is a great director but that film is on a very low level br br the worst part of the film was the ending well let's think of the book in the end we have the guilty <UNK> afterwards they sent him to <UNK> in the end the famous of the friends and family making a plan to save him but that's it a <UNK> now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of and i think just from the moral point i'm sure that would finish the book with an open end because one the one hand he is not guilty is the real murderer and so he have to be a free man but on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him so he has decided to commit the crime that's a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open end well for real it's just not full open br br william shatner as <UNK> i'm sorry no br br the others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great actors in front of course a superb performance of <UNK> as i think that there are not many actors who can play this part in a better way br br but as i said in the beginning this book is <UNK> it never should be film in two hours that's impossible i think that there are some films so maybe they could do the right thing but i just keep the opinion that this book can't be adapted br br so 3 points br br a point for the great director richard brooks br br a point for a superb performance of <UNK> <UNK> br br finally a point for one of the greatest writers of all time
<START> when it was announced the king of pop was dead at age 50 a month before he was to start a series of live comeback shows at <UNK> <UNK> it was a huge shock to millions of people around the world he was and will forever be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry and he will be missed terribly i decided to remind myself how wonderful he was by watching what is considered by many to be not only jackson's best video and possibly song but the greatest music video ever made from director john <UNK> an american werewolf in london the film opens with michael and his girl <UNK> ray having their car breakdown and after giving her a ring the moon comes out and he turns into a werewolf we then see michael and his girl watching this horror film in the cinema she is scared and walks out and michael soon follows her singing the iconic song soon enough the voice of vincent price comes on and zombies start <UNK> out the earth and open <UNK> from the graveyard and michael and the girl are obviously surrounded she turns away and michael has become a zombie himself and with all the other creatures they do the iconic dance before he turns back into his normal self at least for the chorus the girl runs into the near creepy house <UNK> the <UNK> but zombie michael still manages to break through and when he touches her she screams to see normal michael say what's the problem the film ends with him taking her home and looking at us with evil eyes michael jackson was number 14 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons and he was number 6 on the ultimate pop star the thriller album was number 4 on the 100 greatest albums and this video was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest scary moments and it was number 1 on the 100 greatest pop videos very good
<START> spoilers ahead br br it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be br br such a disappointment i thought this was full of silly clichés and br br that it basically tried to hard br br to the american guys out there how many of you spend your br br time jumping on your <UNK> bed and making monkey br br sounds to the married girls how many of you have suddenly br br gone from to overnight but not with your br br husband to the french would you really ask about someone br br being <UNK> la when you know they don't speak french wouldn't br br you use a more common word like br br i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understand br br europe and i love it but my german roommate and i found this br br pretty insulting overall it looked like a movie <UNK> by the br br european <UNK> and it tried too hard basically it had all br br sorts of differences that it tried to tie together not a bad thing in br br itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous too br br many <UNK> that wouldn't really happen then the end of the br br movie the last 10 minutes ruined all the rest why doesn't <UNK> br br talk to the <UNK> students he meets back in paris why does br br he just walk off why does he just run away from his job is that br br freedom and in the end is the new europe supposed to rest on br br a bunch of people who smoke up and <UNK> all day is this what br br it's made up of br br besides the acting was pretty horrible i can't believe <UNK> br br role and acting why was she made to look like br br <UNK> <UNK> so much at first i thought <UNK> was ok but br br with retrospect i think he was pretty bad br br and that's all really too bad because technically opening credits br br scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really br br good except for sound editing around the british siblings and the br br soundtrack was great too so the form was good but the content br br pretty horrible

<START> honestly when i went to see this movie at the rave theater in indiana i did not expect much i went to this movie only because i figured hey it's a wwe movie it'll be good for a laugh then i sat down and watched it and saw why they chose <UNK> <UNK> kane to play <UNK> <UNK> he is probably one of the <UNK> guys on the big screen much worse in my opinion than freddy or jason and has one big advantage to other movies that <UNK> me to a horror movie it shows <UNK> <UNK> as someone who is human he has a heart no matter how twisted and creepy it is he feels pain something that jason never does or appears to show he feels sorrow and pleasure though again both of them insane which you will notice if you see the movie all in all a different experience in my opinion than many slashers and it surprised me in a few ways as in who lived in the end
<START> a man arrives in a strange beautiful <UNK> city where no one feels any emotion and <UNK> instead about interior design the essential of his days is reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> the strange <UNK> in and out of this world more remind one of <UNK> john but truly this is a <UNK> movie a piece of self satire that is also <UNK> in style the tone is <UNK> and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight daring you to laugh at the absurdity to my mind the combination isn't wholly successful there aren't enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties of taking the piece as pure drama it certainly is original perhaps my problem is that the world that it is not one that i <UNK> perhaps i should move to
<START> why did they have to waste money on this crap br br warning contains spoilers br br the plot down to earth good kind girl meets a rich <UNK> ignorant guy her boyfriend gets jealous and with the guy they burn down a <UNK> over an ugly girl guy has to stay in town to build a new <UNK> perfect for the love story to begin but <UNK> the girl is dying isn't that a surprise boys and girls but she teaches him love life and enjoy it he's sad she is dying she dies he is sad but has now learned to love life br br what's the moral of the story when dying teach another person to love life br br like every other love movie ever made br br <UNK> this movie was the thing i have ever seen did the director want to try to make this plot original <UNK> and the <UNK> girl would not die it took her a half hour i felt no pity for the and the love story died the first hour of the movie br br 1 10 br br don't watch this movie unless you want to be bored or get a head <UNK>

<START> this is indeed a spectacularly bad film but it is the rare kind of badness that is endlessly jaw <UNK> entertaining i want to add to the other comments on this film br br the rock band on the plane look like three skinny <UNK> from casual labor wearing bad <UNK> br br watch for the severe continuity problem with the kid's stuffed tiger it turns into a lion a <UNK> and back again it's filthy or clean depending on the shot br br spoiler the stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the kid and the writers br br the sight of little jimmy floating down the amazon in a coffin <UNK> his stuffed tiger and away will stick <UNK> in your memory br br listen for one of the most inept sound effects ever late in the story when the priest is setting out to find jimmy the guide demands his <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> the priest drops on one <UNK> in a moment of <UNK> <UNK> and there is the sound of a bell not the deep of a church bell but the <UNK> of a bell from a boxing match br br this is an absolute hoot to watch
<START> what was the quote by <UNK> <UNK> at the end of the film about a person's past this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed br br everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony br br live and let live br br if anyone knows the quote please let me know thank you br br this film should be shown a lot more <UNK> as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later
<START> so many bad reviewers it made me wonder what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director did you all expected a super hit flawless movie no way you already can see raj kumar loves multi <UNK> movies all of his earlier works where multi but no one was flawless take the first <UNK> <UNK> for instance so many flaws but still good fun anyways sticking to the movie the movie <UNK> <UNK> is a hindi fantasy film about a snake who can take any form which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover on the people who caused it its quite good with a great star cast but i think it could have been much much better for instance take the script can't say its flawless for example take the ages br br do 40 48 <UNK> old still study in university br br there are many many more i won't list more but there are dozen more a solid 5 5 is good for this one br br 75
<START> if i'm to like a movie i need to care about the lead characters and what happens to them in this waste <UNK> of a film i found myself hoping that they would all die in the end none of the characters are people that you'd ever want to meet they all made me sick if not for a few nude scenes i would have given this wretched movie a 1

<START> this film starts as it ends and ends as it starts what is in the middle is a collection of comedy philosophy music observations <UNK> mini stories colour and lots more it looks at the world and our lives and tells the <UNK> story from the view of the group members themselves it also looks at television and film and makes a visual commentary it shocks also with scenes of war and shows how we are just <UNK> in a big game it says all this and much more but if you don't look at it <UNK> you won't see much more than scenes strung together to join up the music it's the sort of film that can never get boring because it's so cleverly done
<START> in love and war is a simple feel good tv film and should be viewed as such br br possible spoiler br br it is the story of a wwii british soldier captured with his <UNK> by the italians and imprisoned in a former <UNK> as the italians surrender to the allies the <UNK> is freed and attempts to flee however the germans arrive and the <UNK> is captured again only injured remains at large the rest of the film <UNK> how he is hidden and <UNK> by the <UNK> and his survival br br end of spoiler br br based on a true story in love and war is a <UNK> straightforward film half comedy half romance the story is simple and <UNK> the is warm and sunny and the various stereotypes the desperately <UNK> or romantic italians the serious stern looking germans and the <UNK> and <UNK> british although unoriginal are still humorous <UNK> <UNK> musical score also adds to the <UNK> <UNK> br br although it is far from being a tea with <UNK> or a la <UNK> e <UNK> in love and war is a sweet simple film that will put a smile and maybe even a little <UNK> on your face
<START> if you are a weirdo who thinks it's romantic and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother get her pregnant and then have sex with her again once she's had an abortion and not tell her that she is related to you then you would like this movie br br <UNK> the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home it makes it even more disgusting and <UNK> that he has no conscience as to what he's doing he can't do right by his job his family or maria he's a loser there is nothing romantic or positive about this movie it is vile and incestuous br br it moves slowly and it leads nowhere for over the first half of the movie i couldn't even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a <UNK> i'm glad we didn't waste our money in the movie theater on this one 0 10
<START> i saw it last night and i was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie the whole audience was bruce campbell has made a damn funny movie i don't want to give anything away but when the film turns and gets wacky it gets really wacky just one funny scene after another my hats of to mr campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget bruce was there to introduce the film and do a q and a which was a treat a lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame but bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic he was great anyway loved the film i'll be looking forward to seeing this on dvd later this year b sure to check it out on the sci fi channel this fall i highly recommend this one
<START> bruce willis as usual does an excellent job br br warning may be considered a spoiler br br while my friend thought it was good i kept <UNK> at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end after seeing such great flicks as the <UNK> and chicken run i was really disappointed in disney's the kid br br willis plays a middle aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on people's images he's an image <UNK> an unknown kid shows up yes it's him but younger and even lily <UNK> can see him at this point i'm reminded of a cross between a poor quantum leap episode and a bad time traveling flick br br kid and willis go through trying to figure out why he's in that time period they figure it out they meet willis when he's older <UNK> that it never goes into detail how old willis them between time periods and gets them together to begin with how he got that knowledge to begin with how he came to the realization that he needed to do this and so on br br basically it's a very tired unoriginal uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it the good news is that the kid actor is nowhere near as annoying as he's presented in the trailers on television
<START> when i first saw stella on comedy central i thought god this is horrible but i loved wet hot american summer so i knew something didn't make sense there was nothing left for me to do but search out for the stella shorts which i had heard contained more <UNK> than any other comedy <UNK> out there when i found them not only were my <UNK> expectations met but i found probably the greatest comedy scenes i've seen in years the set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs not only did i laugh my ass off the first time i watched them but continued to laugh harder when i watched them over and over again it's really a shame comedy central had the <UNK> of cable television for the stella series it would have <UNK> much better on hbo or showtime their brand of humor can't be <UNK> by censors or popular culture given even if it was on hbo i'm sure the masses would have voted it canceled in a season or less but still it would have been fantastic needless to say i'm now in love with stella and all it's individual members any stella fan should check out david <UNK> site with all his short films they are equally as enjoyable as stella itself so my hat goes off to michael michael ian black and david <UNK> for the unbelievable comedy they have made with stella i hope to see much more of the <UNK> in the future
<START> weird this is a tv movie yet the rating on the box says it's rated r there's nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for an r rating aside from that though the movie is very slow and pointless i mean the idea was good but nothing was done with the storyline it just wasn't developed it's mildly creepy and the acting is actually quite good better than the movie deserves i don't see myself watching it again anytime soon if ever there have been other movies dealing with the same concept which are better made than this one i haven't seen too many wes craven films so i can't really compare it to any of his others as for this movie itself though i think it is poorly conceived and poorly executed for me i can't give <UNK> a higher rating than 3 10
<START> oh boy films like this really bother me if this movie is supposed to close to truth then i assume that <UNK> knew hitler for a time before wwii started in the movie <UNK> mentions how hitler had changed from before well i can't imagine that <UNK> wouldn't have known something about hitler's government <UNK> so <UNK> must share some guilt for the german atrocities with that in mind i have a problem with a movie that makes life at the end a tragic one he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him i can't do it i also can't buy the theory that if the more competent <UNK> were allowed to fight the war the allies would have had more trouble winning it if more competent people were in charge wwii may never have started in the first place from a movie watching aspect the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles leo g <UNK> has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents but other than that not very essential
<START> hey <UNK> look there's anna great american improvised new wave or independent you want to call it that not as good as godard or <UNK> and not flawless but hey such realism style warmth and humor i love that ny accent you don't know nothing forget about it just like the french new wave it's about young people <UNK> falling in love or just hanging around <UNK> <UNK> is so cute she's adorable wonderful ben also good reminds me of <UNK> a film you won't forget br br a steady 26 5 out of <UNK>
<START> from what i understand mr <UNK> abandoned this project before <UNK> and rightfully so if i were him i definitely would have made sure that every copy was burned and if anybody in the future ever asked me about this film it never happened it never existed end of story br br despite some great sets and good photography this is one horrible film is it supposed to be scary not in the least is it supposed to be funny <UNK> <UNK> a total waste of time and i really don't like to have to say that
<START> if all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be <UNK> death in <UNK> would have to be it it is a <UNK> in movie history much criticized for being slow boring and too obvious in stating it's point an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is <UNK> destroyed first mentally then physically we should appreciate this movie for what it is a was shot over 30 years ago and it portrays a period even further back at the beginning of the <UNK> century br br life was slow then compared to now people were supposed to behave in a certain way hiding their true emotions even from themselves director visconti and <UNK> <UNK> the leading actor admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer von discovers his romantic interest in a young boy for a man like von in his time this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with we see his inner struggle mostly on the face of <UNK> against the beautiful backdrop of <UNK> and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed by <UNK> br br this movie is slow there is no denying it no special effects car chases or fights to keep the audience <UNK> to their seats no perverted sex scenes either the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen <UNK> from <UNK> and the occasional smile br br so basically nothing much happens in this movie not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum if you want them to be played like the strings of a <UNK> in a romantic <UNK> this is the movie to do it
<START> first of all let me just say that after watching this movie i felt like i'd been sold a bill of goods mind you it's not the movie's fault that imdb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second although i don't know how that's entered maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in being a fan of the horror comedy genre i checked it out based on that and i'm so so sorry i did where to start first of all to touch back on my beginning there's no comedy in this movie it tries once or twice but never gets more than a chuckle at best my reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny also there's no horror here not a second of tension can be found you think i'm <UNK> i am not no tension very little blood and not much violence on screen sorry but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul hell there's even zero nudity call me a <UNK> or juvenile i prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot premise and that tired as all hell reality tv show gone wrong thing it's been done before and a lot better like wrong turn 2 or <UNK> whatever that movie was called with edward <UNK> that's how bad this movie is i don't even remember the name of that movie but it was better than this i also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because reality tv is taking over did someone from the past post that with a time machine are you freaking kidding me this thing is trash and not in a fun way
<START> as you may know <UNK> is the most developed country in the world regarding to human development <UNK> this film <UNK> reveal our future to us our future would be that of <UNK> since we are all <UNK> to achieve the best and offer the least the life that was shown was maybe an exaggeration yet comparing today's concerns with those of our <UNK> it is not far from reality reasoning br br watching this film free from all of our pre <UNK> we can find both of our faces the one that is laughing at the brilliant scene of <UNK> <UNK> her girlfriend and the one that is searching through magazines hours and hours to choose some stupid chair among stupid <UNK> br br the idea of the hole with the hope of <UNK> was another magnificent idea of the film the slight glory yet the only one and the effort that was put to reach it makes us feel closer to <UNK> br br although i was attracted mostly to the idea and production of the film played pretty well and the atmosphere of the film was quite
<START> ladies and gentlemen be sad or be glad we are in the disgusting <UNK> t v series era now count with me and our luck br br <UNK> crime scene investigation <UNK> miami <UNK> ny <UNK> crossing jordan da <UNK> even the <UNK> mysteries didn't we already have enough br br from the late 1990 till the late <UNK> we've got almost the same sick series about the genius <UNK> with a partner or a team who go to solve crimes by <UNK> the <UNK> and what a nauseating mission to do so you will have for sure lots and lots of <UNK> scenes where we see clearly accurately and awfully the most horrific shots in the history of t v br br oh god once we had the great days the good cop or detective era such as columbo <UNK> <UNK> and simon simon or the good old sci fi era like the six million dollar man the <UNK> woman knight rider and oh boy we've got also the hot sexy such cover up the love boat <UNK> even a flop as thunder in paradise br br all of those were unforgettable original had good real good thoughts action women till the x files came and then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact the catastrophe br br x files undoubtedly was one of the greatest but there was a few slight <UNK> we had have agent dana <UNK> medical doctor and fbi agent at every episode doing an <UNK> and of course her lap as the series succeed became part of our living room so the <UNK> for money producers loved it with all the physical terror the exciting hunt for the truth therefore they tried to repeat it in another not too far <UNK> the <UNK> br br but it became so ugly full of and very <UNK> just like bones plus the <UNK> present of emily <UNK> and <UNK> as david <UNK> he was much better in angel and all of these corpses to the extent that every time i've watched it i found my self screaming what a terrible gross br br <UNK> it please you've canceled before real good shows such as the lone <UNK> or a man called <UNK> here it's a bad one so please little mercy and enough with the bones era or we'll drop dead ourselves of <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this is an incredibly fun action exploitation 80s rocker charles bronson rules as paul the villains are hilariously bad the soundtrack by jimmy page is laughably bad alex winter bill of bill ted is great as one of the street <UNK> who gets wasted by bronson and crew crew oh those are the <UNK> <UNK> who team up with bronson to win back the streets the whole movie is enjoyable with the last half hour or so exploding into non stop action and mayhem 9 10
<START> o boy was this really bad br br i saw this on <UNK> br br in scenes that had soundtrack music it was hard to hear the dialog when people were on the <UNK> it was hard to hear the person on the other end it appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used because the colors and focus sometimes <UNK> drastically between edits and there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional br br one <UNK> of the budget one of many was when a news report comes on tv there is just a news flash title card badly <UNK> with a video effect onto a tv screen and a voice over by a <UNK> they couldn't shoot footage of a <UNK> and then actually show it on the tv br br the movie starts off with a killer wearing <UNK> <UNK> and mask wielding a <UNK> supposedly he's a paranoid <UNK> who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a <UNK> performed on him br br students are let out of school for a break and three young women decide to have a <UNK> party three guys decide to crash the party and a geek named science decides to crash it too the <UNK> party is pretty boring and the guys just keep showing up randomly wearing masks taking the masks off and then disappearing the mother and father the surgeon who was to do the <UNK> of one of the girls keep showing up too the killer knocks <UNK> people's throats without anyone really <UNK> the apparent lead of the movie more or less <UNK> through the movie perhaps that was bad acting or maybe it was intentional since much of the movie is a nightmare and some of it a nightmare within a nightmare br br the ending is really horrible too br br the best thing about the movie is the cheesy united home video vhs box art which was <UNK> for the dvd release a double feature with terror at i honestly can't tell if it is a photo or a painting or a combination of both the women <UNK> on the cover are not in the movie and the clothing they're wearing is way more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore the throat <UNK> on the cover is scarier than the ones in the movie where people tend to affect a goofy pop eyed look for that matter that's what the killer has most of the time head <UNK> and eyes <UNK> out <UNK> for the camera frequently the <UNK> was held up close to the camera in focus while the killer's mask covered face was in close up but out of focus in the background
<START> excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal it is rare for me to be <UNK> aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because i try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing in the case of full ride the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story i was too busy during first and only viewing <UNK> between laughter and <UNK> br br fortunately for most individual members of the cast pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting <UNK> smith and meredith monroe are at least well matched physically finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters br br unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes smith and <UNK> <UNK> lack of talent on the positive side they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not <UNK> br br better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age the basic story is not particularly original just another variation on an officer and a gentleman but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of teenage actors br br then again what do i know i'm just a child
<START> walter matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner jack lemmon from the fortune cookie to the odd couple ii but people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films a female partner this was glenda jackson the english double oscar winner who demonstrated her comic abilities against <UNK> first in house calls and then in <UNK> role was slightly larger in both films because his characters were more central to the plots but the chemistry between them was quite good if you ever want to see two pros <UNK> how sexual <UNK> can be <UNK> funny watch walter and glenda as dr <UNK> nicholson and ann <UNK> <UNK> to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor never has sex been looked at from such a <UNK> and mechanical point of view br br <UNK> charlie has just been widowed before the film began he has only had one woman in his life his wife so now he's the <UNK> bachelor he also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of but the chief surgeon is dr <UNK> art <UNK> <UNK> is apparently <UNK> there are moments later in the film that show he turns his <UNK> on and off see the scene where he <UNK> richard <UNK> car <UNK> is up for re election charlie is his closest <UNK> for the post if he wants it however <UNK> manages to convince charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self <UNK> br br one day charlie notices ann in the hospital she has had a slight accident and is <UNK> in bed but <UNK> has put her into a cage like <UNK> which charlie remarks has not been used since about <UNK> he gets her out of the device and soon is <UNK> her she joins the staff of the hospital but she is critical of charlie's <UNK> to <UNK> to <UNK> and she is critical of certain selfish <UNK> she sees among the doctors in the hospital br br <UNK> causes the death of a wealthy <UNK> of the hospital lloyd <UNK> who owned a baseball team his greatest <UNK> being separate admission costs for double <UNK> tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner delivering the <UNK> at the burial service the line in the summary above is the line of the <UNK> however she is still determined to sue her lawyer <UNK> david says the hospital is the most incompetent he's ever seen so <UNK> suggests that charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive <UNK> but how will ann react to this the film is quite amusing and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for jackson and matthau it led to a television series as well
<START> after watching this movie on tv i looked it up in the imdb and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 7 6 this is not a good film especially bad is the editing the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction it's not very <UNK> done i do agree that the acting was fairly decent especially kelly and that the story was intriguing enough
<START> first off let it be known that i came into this movie not for the music actually i find it <UNK> really i was interested in the psychology of the punk <UNK> on this point the documentary did fairly well one <UNK> aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the hyped up band and <UNK> crowd are shown running amok if you've seen the first such scene you've seen them all this is party made up for by <UNK> lyrics for some of the songs with these the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band the lyrics are of far more interest than the <UNK> of sounds <UNK> from the <UNK> i don't know why all the lyrics were not <UNK> scenes without lyrics slow ironic eh given the many references to the speed of the music the flow of the movie also insightful were the interviews with fans and bands though there is a letdown when the latter <UNK> interviews prove to be not nearly as enthralling or humorous as the first two overall a good movie that i'm glad i saw i'll check out the follow ups if i ever get a chance br br favorite quote he tried to hide the fact that he couldn't play by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over himself and breaking glass br br broad punk <UNK> though their lack of <UNK> and <UNK> and drug induced is often hilarious in the end it is understood that <UNK> are just pathetic <UNK> who rebel just for the sake of rebellion as seen through <UNK> lyrics and naive attempts to <UNK> and <UNK> black flag who are slightly less misguided than their peers
<START> a strange relationship between a middle aged woman and a <UNK> who gonna be a woman soon charlotte and both trapped by their <UNK> lives and don't know how to get out of them charlotte is an owner of a beauty clinic she has broken up with her aggressive ex husband moved into an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except her big bed <UNK> lives <UNK> with her poor dog she's sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother's visiting and the bad relationship with her dad her only hope is that the upcoming <UNK> operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine all she can do now is waiting for an <UNK> <UNK> br br then these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved into other's lives there are some <UNK> between them but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do eventually the ending is quite satisfying and leaves some imagination for us to think about it br br the director's great work gives me an great impression she handles the development of characters very well the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense also i am so obsessed with the gloomy lights all over the apartment but full of desire br br two main characters are played by and david they are amazing in their roles a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing br br this swedish indie film is about <UNK> and change no matter you're homosexual or <UNK> male or female the <UNK> of life exists everywhere whenever you fall across it you'll be hesitate and <UNK> but at least don't be afraid follow your heart and choose the right way
<START> ok let's start with the good nice scenery <UNK> <UNK> is easy to look at amanda has nice hair that's about it how much of this movie went on the editing room floor probably the plot action good dialogue and point terrible acting horrible choppy dialogue let me tell you how bad it is my friend who always cries at movies got to the part that was meant to evoke tears and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying the movie seems to want to take a stab at too many issues war loss <UNK> cancer but fails so miserably to cover any one topic <UNK> make sure you have something to <UNK> on and your cell phone to return text messages
<START> this short has all the elements of a great movie every time i show it to friends on <UNK> they love it too the dialog is so <UNK> the acting is superb while the effects props weren't as convincing by themselves taken with everything else in the shot they are expertly placed used the music is so haunting perfect for this kind of film people who hold dear their beliefs and thoughts are <UNK> to their core about what they see in this movie most go <UNK> it ' but in the end they <UNK> with new understanding and leave the movie with one word to describe it br br <UNK> the beauty of the film is also skin deep i love the fact that there aren't any <UNK> views no other voices and the voices that you do hear are <UNK> with each other no conflict but at the same time there is one and the ending made me love it more harsh reality sometimes is more film worthy than any plot device or twist br br wasn't joshua leonard the guy in blair witch project movie by a <UNK> dead guy great
<START> this is a film about passion the passion it depicts is largely <UNK> even for the leading man but <UNK> lies the incredible power of this film it shows us that what we believe can be <UNK> by nonsense and can even lead us to do things that are destructive to ourselves or others moreover those who try to escape from <UNK> passion watch the <UNK> who visits the studio also risk self destruction br br the world needs to hear the message of this movie more often
<START> where the rivers flow north is a well told story about two <UNK> fight to live their own lives in the face of progress and development besides enjoying the movie as entertainment i also learned quite a bit about life in rural new england back in the late 1920s br br the cinematography captured the raw beauty of northern <UNK> and set the stage while the music brought the movie to life very well done for a low budget <UNK> produced film i found michael j <UNK> character the weakest in the film but rip torn and <UNK> turn in two of the finest performances i've seen in a long time i was <UNK> she did not get a nod as best actress that year i assume the film was too small a film to be considered
<START> amidst all the many problems that make this a dire piece of celluloid is the stupidest plot device in recent cinema history richard gere <UNK> who the real target is through some form of revelation he does not work anything out it just comes to him when in doubt he's going after the first lady this film blows <UNK>
<START> i expected a good movie what i got was an even better movie the chemistry between james and smith is just incredible glad to see him in a major motion picture for once br br the movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly will smith is fantastic with his never ending charm kevin james is hilarious and eva <UNK> well let's just say she plays that bitch sweet annoying role to the best of her ability br br what i loved about the movie was the fact that will smith didn't even have to try to be lovable he just was the date doctor had all the right moves said everything in the most perfect of ways and never ever went over the top br br the funny parts are hilarious and the cute romantic parts are unforgettable br br i totally recommend this movie and no it is not a chick flick
<START> the only time i seem to through imdb comments is when i've seen a duff film i guess i'm looking to find <UNK> that it's not just me for me then <UNK> jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which <UNK> on <UNK> and <UNK> towards a cop out hackneyed conclusion so i check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like jim out on a <UNK> <UNK> as page after page of multiple star ratings and <UNK> leave me <UNK> my critical <UNK> yet maybe i should check the settings for the comments presentation since after a while the <UNK> dies down and i'm <UNK> to see that mirror my own i feel <UNK> it is a rubbish film it doesn't hang together and it does <UNK> a wasted evening sitting through it praise be to <UNK> spirits
<START> this is one of the best films i've seen from the silent era sad to say i've yet to see too many with the exception of chaplin keaton stuff very visually brilliant with insanely influential style in editing and composition really unique especially for its time camera angles and extremely <UNK> editing definitely a must see for the film nerd br br the downside is that it is a bit too in your face about its politics i have no problem with politics in film as long as they are subtle or at least somewhat as a <UNK> to the story also it's not an entertainment film which is fine but it's not something i'm going to watch a billion times this is art plain and simple like it or not br br worth an a for influence alone but based on personal enjoyment i give it an a
<START> when i was younger this movie always aired on friday night in the summer on channel 40 this was the years before fox was a network and took over the programming i always looked forward to it i'd go <UNK> shopping with my parents then sit down with my tv dinner and a lady lee <UNK> the only time of the week i was allowed to drink <UNK> and enjoy sure the script is predictably late 70's like little <UNK> but it's a fun movie and i loved <UNK> and bill murray <UNK> with little effort in the movie but he is charming gotta love <UNK> and those taped glasses pre revenge of the <UNK> chris <UNK> is pretty much the same character he played in my bodyguard but he does it so well
<START> this is not a good film br br i can usually sit through a van damme movie if i have to as they are usually a bit of a laugh and don't require much thought this one has no redeeming features br br it has a distinct lack of plot humour acting direction etc etc a real stinker on all levels br br i have never walked out of a cinema during a movie although i came damme close here br br avoid at all costs
<START> i have just wasted my saturday night watching this crap i saw the names of chris <UNK> mr big from sex the city robert patrick from x files the <UNK> elliot <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> on the credit a very reasonable imdb rating 5 6 and many good reviews in imdb for my total surprise the film is horrible the characters are badly constructed the story tries to be funny but it is totally silly the character of <UNK> <UNK> is amazingly stupid for a professor of <UNK> so i decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews and i found that most of them are made by imdb users with only review therefore relatives or friends of the cast and crew or people hired to promote this garbage my vote is three br br title brazil without return
<START> the forgotten aka don't look in the basement is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror movie br br the story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited about br br the patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughing br br now the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesn't really deserve its place on the video <UNK> list br br overall if you aren't looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then it's worth a watch
<START> how could a film dealing with illegal mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull well border incident is br br no wonder that song and dance man george murphy's career ended not long after this terrible film came out politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slowly paced film the film stereotypes the typical mexican <UNK> farmer worker as <UNK> and awfully dull br br the film only picks up in intensity once the identities of murphy and <UNK> <UNK> have been discovered as federal agents for the u s and mexico respectively br br disappointing at best we see similar problems in our very own society today
<START> business executive is kidnapped made to wander miles and miles in a <UNK> for days and days <UNK> dialog with his <UNK> and we have got to listen to all the nonsense br br meanwhile his <UNK> wife and family are at home with the fbi wondering what to do at no time does she seem concerned about the fate of her husband except when it comes to the <UNK> a love story give me a break br br the plot is ludicrous and almost every scene is filled with an air of expectation that something significant is going to happen but it never does br br the result of the kidnapping is predictable and stupid and it becomes even more silly when we learn the fate of the <UNK> br br this is garbage br br 2 out of 10
<START> the poet <UNK> disappears <UNK> he disappeared with <UNK> and is followed by the judge <UNK> the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he <UNK> understand and he <UNK> want to it´s a long way from the wonderful les <UNK> du <UNK>
<START> the good things first i agree with another viewer who said that gene raymond has a marvelous drunk scene he does i was <UNK> to finally get a chance to laugh and there were other moments i found amusing parents in the bathroom with the <UNK> <UNK> and the scene in the restaurant with robert <UNK> trying to make carole lombard jealous by <UNK> sweet <UNK> to a stranger br br but overall i was <UNK> i love carol lombard and most of hitchcock and i understand the <UNK> laid on productions by the <UNK> code but this was embarrassing and awful to watch of course i knew they'd end up together this is a romantic comedy after all but it made no sense it happened too fast plus i can't believe the <UNK> of love when confronted with such <UNK> behavior both physical and <UNK>
<START> this movie has been done when hitler and <UNK> who is as well in the movie was at the top and many politics and even the roman church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of <UNK> especially in usa there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in germany and europe charles for example it would be as today a big actor would made a parody of <UNK> or chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and imho a great <UNK> he was a courageous man the movie is funny and deep the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated i think this movie is one of the best ever done
<START> a wonderful film ahead of its time br br i think so in the it was all about winning greed is good remember that one i have seen this film more that 20 times to me this is a real desert island film i keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that i just love jessica <UNK> and <UNK> are simply wonderful also beverly <UNK> beau bridges come in at a close second don't get me wrong there are many more great in this film and it is also the way it is written that made it for me and i hope you a film that you will want to see over and over i think tv shows like exposure and now earl owe a lot to this film but remember it is not a tom cruise film
<START> years ago when darling <UNK> played on tv it was always the pan and <UNK> version which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an <UNK> dvd of this julie andrews blake <UNK> <UNK> i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all br br boy what a terrible film it's so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it's obvious to any fans of movies that blake <UNK> created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary <UNK> sound of music thoroughly modern <UNK> etc but also because andrews was <UNK> from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself <UNK> my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this <UNK> effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre <UNK> of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling <UNK> suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing br br mind you the version on the dvd is the director's cut or in this case let's salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd <UNK> cut 19 scenes 19 from the original <UNK> theatrical version into this more <UNK> and yet remarkably <UNK> version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going what kind of spy is <UNK> how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone's death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to <UNK> her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some <UNK> to the <UNK> proceedings there's no <UNK> in this story br br one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that <UNK> and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by <UNK> and <UNK> previous <UNK> the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest <UNK> <UNK> sound of music it's no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment <UNK> of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews <UNK> other films the endless scenes of <UNK> is inspired by the much better modern <UNK> the musical moment i'll give you three <UNK> was created just to make fun of <UNK> mary <UNK> persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a <UNK> in the act the ending <UNK> eye view of julie running towards <UNK> plane is another <UNK> at sound of music br br the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on <UNK> they talk and talk and then julie suddenly off in mid sentence i'm like what happened here br br the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where's peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train <UNK> <UNK> shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing <UNK> in the process brilliant what's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his <UNK> reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that's one slow moving train there br br the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but it's effect is <UNK> considerably because it's repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scene and julie <UNK> too the girl in no man's land is ok even if it's bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because <UNK> sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured <UNK> by the result of her <UNK> br br the whole project is <UNK> and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks <UNK> like she's on <UNK> but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy <UNK> desperately wanted to <UNK> the mary <UNK> syndrome his wife and believed that playing a <UNK> was a good career decision as much as i like julie she's no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in <UNK> <UNK> funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as <UNK> and cute br br how bad is darling <UNK> even after <UNK> years since its release blake <UNK> felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release
<START> i saw this mini movie when it first aired and loved it it kinda funny to see how far people will go for money it's also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be whipped whipped enough to kill i think the cast was great especially the character <UNK> without her smooth talking and <UNK> looks the movie would have not been the same br br i never use to watch usa but now it is one of my stations br br
<START> jack lemmon was one of our great actors his performances in days of wine and <UNK> the apartment some like it hot missing to name the first ones that come to mind were all worthy of best actor nomination his only win was for save the tiger and that's a shame he gets melancholy down to a science but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character he actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one note <UNK> <UNK> ross br br as for the movie wonderful supporting work by jack <UNK> as <UNK> partner and <UNK> david as an <UNK> go for <UNK> because the rest of the script is a muddled <UNK> of cliched vignettes angst neurotic nostalgia and pointless <UNK> worth seeing once as a time capsule into 1970's style experimental direction by
<START> well <UNK> is not awful but it comes close production values are decent and the main actors do a pretty good job except for rosario dawson in a wasted role but the story is just pathetic i don't know if the <UNK> leonard book had such dumb characters since i haven't read it but i'm guessing that the book was supposed to be at least slightly humorous the movie has no <UNK> humor after the first twenty minutes you'll be yelling at the screen oh come on <UNK> that stupid in a nutshell and without any spoilers everybody acts in a manner convenient to the plot which makes no sense anyway a very frustrating and unrealistic movie which may account for it sitting on the shelf for as long as it did
<START> i know it's a movie but when it comes to portray real life in any matter it should be as faithful as possible i'm sorry but el isn't as accurate as it seems nor is the <UNK> republic depicted as it really is in fact it shocked me to see that the filming location for <UNK> <UNK> was actually cuba and incredibly enough movies with cuban themes <UNK> the lost city bitter sugar the godfather part ii were actually filmed in <UNK> <UNK> so what happened here why did they shoot the movie in cuba instead of the d r the spanish dialogs with the cuban accent are horrible those are not <UNK> on the historic level would have never been <UNK> he might as well been shot decapitated or died from the <UNK> torture he'd been receiving then thrown his body in the <UNK> sea but would have never ordered death by <UNK> his sick mind wouldn't have allowed it br br acting isn't delivered as expected harvey keitel looks like he's just expecting a paycheck i prefer the leading actress in deep blue sea the rest of the cast would have been excellent in some cuban movie and the same goes for the selected shooting location br br i suggest la del <UNK> the feast of the goat from <UNK> author mario vargas <UNK> directed by his cousin luis <UNK> it's a bit more realistic with <UNK> history the character is very well portrayed and the incident is treated very briefly in this movie
<START> black day blue night was actually good modern noir three young <UNK> on the run from their own lives team up on something of a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere as most modern noir does one woman finds that her husband is cheating on her and after finding him in a hotel room decides to head off and start <UNK> strangely enough she travels with her husband's mistress who is <UNK> given that the <UNK> never told her he was married and together while driving in the <UNK> rain they meet a third very mysterious young man with a <UNK> full of secrets while they're <UNK> and free and all suspicious of one another the cops back at town have them marked as suspects in the death of a policeman br br black day blue night starts out with immediate confrontation and throws in a pretty good story with all it's twists meant to <UNK> your <UNK> of one character after another leading to a very unusual ending that is the movie starts with immediate action confrontation and once you think the story is solved you are immediately thrust into yet another turn in the plot revealing just a little more than you expected before the movie is over br br but as some viewers have written the ending is slightly confusing and a bit of a let down the killer is not who you would immediately expect and once revealed becomes somewhat confusing due to a rather <UNK> explained flashback which reveals all of the necessary motive to solve the mystery but actually there is a finale beyond that which i would think is the most interesting of the film because modern noir always involves a circle of criminal suspects almost always all of them guilty of something it is also a genre that always involves money and thus the question in these movies always becomes how far are the characters willing to go for money br br if you like this rendition of modern film noir i would suggest watching red rock west it's also got j t walsh and some going <UNK> in the <UNK> desert
<START> thomas <UNK> controversial novel is the basis for the film a death in <UNK> although in the book the hero is an author in the film the director <UNK> visconti who also wrote the screenplay transforms him into a composer as such the author composer <UNK> von <UNK> <UNK> on the verge of mental <UNK> is a burned out <UNK> after a long and successful career now seeks the peace and <UNK> of a less <UNK> life he decides to go on vacation to <UNK> where he hopes to <UNK> his <UNK> ambition however while staying at the <UNK> <UNK> resort he captures the attention of a beautiful young teenage boy who eyes him with curious interest and is immediately smitten by him although <UNK> is captivated by the wondrous youth he nevertheless must find some private time away from the boy's <UNK> nora <UNK> while having to cope with a <UNK> plague which seems to have <UNK> the city the movie dialog like the novel remains subtle as are the few brief encounters between the boy and the artist in the end the audience unlike the book is <UNK> with <UNK> and imaginative <UNK> of fancy their affair is never given wing substance or opportunity and were it not for the brief resolution in the book the film allows only the possibility of <UNK> if ' nevertheless one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a <UNK> peace to obtain that which is forbidden <UNK> but definitely criticized by <UNK> eyes great story and a <UNK> classic
<START> please if you're thinking about renting this movie don't if you're thinking of watching a couple of <UNK> clips don't if i had my way nobody would even have to read this summary br br the acting despite being one <UNK> the high points of the movie was still pathetic the director was <UNK> a <UNK> the witty one liners were something you'd expect from a room of highly paid anti social 7 year olds that eat paint <UNK> for breakfast br br the problem with this movie is that it tries to be a movie like evil dead 2 do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies in that it's so bad it's funny but it also tries to be funny at the same time and fails so <UNK> to do so that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag <UNK> in an to save itself br br i could go on for much much more <UNK> just how awful it really was but i think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it if you need me i'll be off trying to <UNK> myself so that i might feel clean again
<START> the cover of the vhs says it all without doubt the most powerful movie of its kind since the texas chainsaw massacre i'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and i have to say i agree 100 the characters are believable the actors have an excellent charm especially george kennedy as the forest ranger there's the twisted atmosphere that only tcm has an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror this has to be one of the most beautifully shot horror films of all time jeff as a director of this 1981 low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works blue sunshine wrong turn added he must be one of the most underrated directors in the today
<START> after seeing the <UNK> so <UNK> and thinking it was nothing more than average i was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another <UNK> <UNK> this time i was much less disappointed than i was with <UNK> and i must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of george clooney well done mr clooney make more of these and less <UNK> movies you can act and you showed it here br br 7 out of 10
<START> 1st watched 10 <UNK> 2006 4 out of 10 <UNK> john <UNK> mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight work in world war i as england entered the war they are told not to go in the <UNK> of the <UNK> mansion which of course they do over and over and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down this is the it referred to in the title created by the jim <UNK> group and voiced by eddie izzard the problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from this part of the movie is not done very well because it's obvious the children primarily the <UNK> character do not learn from them but instead keep going back to it to solve their next big problem it is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian eddie izzard really not given much opportunity to <UNK> and kenneth branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle although he is the best character the children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers so all in all this was an ok film but could have been much better
<START> as the above suggests i was ultimately <UNK> with this movie it is lovely to look at the scenery is lush but the detail of the story in particular the characters are totally unbelievable films don't have to be believable but films like this with a political edge and social commentary do br br similarly i have no problem with <UNK> as such but once again films like this shouldn't be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw this is absolutely the case with sutherland who is frankly rubbish as doyle his accent was far from authentic but he fell into the biggest trap of all his accent is his performance and we end up with a caricature of with no personality outside of his <UNK> i find it totally implausible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job all in all this is a clear case of commercial interest over quality and when you're trying to be the mission this kind of thing <UNK> your chances of success br br speaking of accents there were a couple more problems one being the striking <UNK> of boy's accent which acted to <UNK> the feeling of being transported to another time more surprising was samantha <UNK> much <UNK> irish accent which was <UNK> to say the least her voice <UNK> between strong north and soft south even in the voice overs where i would've expected any such <UNK> to be picked up br br however these are minor <UNK> compared to the motivation and actions of sarah she never seems at home with the english and almost instantly at home with her son and his tribe the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she if offered just seems like a no <UNK> perhaps a lot has been lost in editing perhaps this was meant to be a three hour film or a mini series where these things could've been fleshed out but i can only judge what i've seen br br now the biggest problem <UNK> <UNK> relationship with doyle sutherland is incomprehensible the fact is that her affection for him is not conveyed in any way until her having to choose between him and her son the conflict she goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me br br as you may have guessed this movie didn't work at all for me but it is top notch to look at you really won't see anything more stunning in terms of scenery there are some good performances and my wife liked it
<START> i remember seeing this film in the theater and liking it i happened to stumble upon it on fear net last month and watched it again and found it better with age first of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you <UNK> compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it <UNK> quite well if <UNK> up against films in its unique horror sub genre which i would term action horror as opposed to psychological horror such as the shining or the exorcist br br furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods or in this instance bad the film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous <UNK> house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door the film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have if you compare nod to contemporary big budget horror films such as i am legend the vincent price version was much better this film really stands out modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by cgi most have no plot or character at all and are completely predictable the special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are plastic if this is 80s horror cheese i'll take it over 95 of current entries in the genre br br on a closing note seeing nod again made me remember the beautiful jill and wonder why i have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise jill on the odd chance that you read this i think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films lastly if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot
<START> an <UNK> man known as bill lives in a small dreary flat with a poster of marilyn monroe on the wall and his <UNK> for company only the man can't think of anything to write he wanders around the streets following people just to see where they go maybe this will give him some inspiration to write he begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag he follows him for a few days while in a <UNK> the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of bill and <UNK> why bill is following him the well dressed man says his name is <UNK> <UNK> then surprisingly informs bill that he is a <UNK> and even starts to take bill with him into houses to steal things although <UNK> insists he doesn't go into other people's homes to just steal he says he likes to let people know he has been there and interrupted the things they take for granted he puts <UNK> from another <UNK> into a man's <UNK> for example br br the film is told in flashbacks at times too the director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature <UNK> bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit on the advice of <UNK> he meets a blonde lady in a club who used to date the owner a bald man who is very dangerous she says we see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the blonde <UNK> flat these are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion
<START> i thought this was very different compared to most modern interpretations of shakespeare and enjoyed it thoroughly it would not be useful for those studying it at school etc as it does not show the traditional shakespeare character interpretations i e miranda is portrayed quite <UNK> compared to your traditional shakespeare lady but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch it does not include also the correct format as in the <UNK> of acts and scenes as i am currently playing miranda in a production and most of her lines had been cut and some scenes split and mixed around but it is very useful and i would definitely recommend it as a must see even if just to say you've seen it shakespeare fans would love this
<START> this movie is so bad it's worth seeing this movie will have viewers <UNK> in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes it all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a <UNK> being <UNK> and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast however they know it's been done before many times so to make it different let's do it very badly major masters has his name <UNK> from 80's movie to live and die in l a from character played by willem dafoe that saved 10 minutes in writing and production time the plane is supposed to be a <UNK> that plane has a unique <UNK> even in the dark with its characteristic forward <UNK> on the top just ask the late ronald reagan who <UNK> this point when them shot down <UNK> <UNK> in the eighties yet when the plane takes off it's clearly not a <UNK> looks more like a this well <UNK> film also forgets to include the seat in the <UNK> and <UNK> it with two <UNK> <UNK> seats no need for a flight engineer on this complex plane heroine is played by <UNK> <UNK> gloria <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> up the <UNK> despite several bus loads of people on this <UNK> jet nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them he's just forced to <UNK> himself br br the crippled plane <UNK> fuel from all the <UNK> <UNK> won't make it back to hawaii so masters will try to land at an air force base located on an island only the 300 feet too short four army guys with little the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse <UNK> to the back of your <UNK> are gonna clear a 200 foot wide and 300 foot long <UNK> through the jungle in 20 minutes no need for a <UNK> here where can you find guys like this these guys could make a highway between los angeles and las vegas in 3 hours <UNK> only with <UNK> a <UNK> and a duck br br after that <UNK> <UNK> is fixed masters will try to land the plane as heroine <UNK> away <UNK> <UNK> to himself and <UNK> gets free to make more trouble he is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that i can't tell you but can you say <UNK> dick br br there are so many retarded scenes in this movie the wounded captain is <UNK> prone on the bar on the plane while masters who supposedly can barely fly puts the plane into 60 degree banks and 20 000 feet per minute drops the pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts but doesn't <UNK> an inch br br i think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts this moving could have been way better if we need a <UNK> heroine in the movie why not pick better known actress <UNK> peters who seems to be <UNK> <UNK> as well besides she can sing and the <UNK> well aging peters could feature some gratuitous <UNK> shots now with the singing angle this could be a <UNK> let's land the plane movie musical cast <UNK> pavarotti as the pilot they can sing a <UNK> in the <UNK> prior to the <UNK> and there's no way that <UNK> <UNK> would fly up to the ceiling as masters works his magic on that big bird in keeping with the musical theme masters could then be played by <UNK> that peters can sing with as he lands the plane not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of english now that's a plot think of the edge of your seat conversation between masters and the air traffic <UNK> br br <UNK> sir please <UNK> back to <UNK> <UNK> set to 25 degrees maintain heading br br what br br <UNK> sir arm spoilers now confirm <UNK> pressure at 250 maintain descent at 500 br br what br br the <UNK> could have been played by the late great rodney <UNK> who can <UNK> a <UNK> of his one liners as he sits tied up and <UNK> i get no respect my wife is into group sex yeah she screwed me in front of the judge and jury get the idea br br missed opportunities the movie has your standard crying and <UNK> passengers that are never developed woody allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues she said i was great in bed i told her i practice myself a lot now this is a movie br br also according to similar movie executive decision where lazy eyed steven segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance have massive up top the plane was introduced in 1969 so who knows what has <UNK> in almost 40 years up there my uncle has old clothes a <UNK> magazines and all sorts of stuff in his wouldn't it have been cool if masters opened the trap door and saw a <UNK> eyed chevy chase in a woman's watching old super 8 movies of his childhood just a recommendation br br so give it a chance and as u <UNK> in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if i had my hand in it
<START> this movie was so bad it looked like a home movie in one scene the camera very slowly and gradually <UNK> down then moves back up into place again the sound is and occasionally fades out then in again in another scene the camera man is just visible in a mirror br br then came the scene with <UNK> how to put down a <UNK> which believe me went on for ages and was completely irrelevant to the plot most scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant either in my opinion these were just to fill out the movie and make it longer even with these scenes added it was very short br br the only good thing about it was the severed head which did look quite realistic
<START> how can anyone dare say anything bad about this film <UNK> mel brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it br br the first time i saw this i cried from laughing so hard everything about it is funny br br while robin hood men in <UNK> is not my favorite comedy that spot is taken by real genius it ranks way up there in my book so go see it if you don't spend the whole time laughing then at least you'll spend the whole time <UNK> over cary <UNK>
<START> i just watched this an early harold lloyd short film that featured his glasses character on <UNK> <UNK> dvd of the harold lloyd collection he's actually a con man with <UNK> <UNK> as his partner who gets discovered by <UNK> daniels who herself performs fake what she discovers is that lloyd and <UNK> <UNK> many customers by dropping fake rings that are lost i'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when harold and <UNK> enter the place <UNK> works and encounter some creepy <UNK> and put on costumes like <UNK> trying one of outfits not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny so on that note i recommend are crooks <UNK>
<START> this new movie by is awesome check it out and you'll be amazed the story of emily waters once a girl from a broken home whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her until one night her drawings <UNK> into reality and saved her and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away the music is incredible as well it really the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict directed by jesse and animated by <UNK> starring the beautiful <UNK> with music by <UNK> <UNK> daniel collins jeff matt and support this film and support he is a very talented guy go see his film shades of grey as well
<START> since the plot like vertigo or brian <UNK> obsession till to the score by peter chase that reminds the sounds of bernard <UNK> this little pearl seems to be sight from <UNK> remarkable playing by and vincent <UNK> in a <UNK> paris portrayed from the famous <UNK> a little cult it is a pity that the only version available on dvd are the french one and the english directed by a controversial artist as <UNK> it could be considered a little homage to the cinema <UNK> it is a french movie and as all of them not for all we could say a cinema even if not so <UNK> it could be remembered for several reason
<START> overrated poorly written badly acted did the academy even watch this i guess not the political content guaranteed it an oscar nomination <UNK> <UNK> border a little boy terrorism anything with the word terrorist gets attention in br br this post 9 11 world its like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an oscar nomination <UNK> of their merits br br and please cinematography does not mean shooting landscapes which are pretty in the first place you have to be a rotten <UNK> to screw up making the desert pretty at least this didn't win the oscar they got that right at least would have been a travesty
<START> house of dracula is a good sequel to house of frankenstein there isn't as much action but the acting is just as good <UNK> stevens is the <UNK> doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from dracula via a <UNK> dracula was actually receiving the <UNK> to overcome his <UNK> but he puts a spell on a <UNK> nurse and then his blood into the doctor it turns out that dracula really didn't come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse dracula is destroyed and the wolf man is next in line for a cure which is successful in the meantime <UNK> monster is discovered and <UNK> briefly before burning to death don't worry the same trio came back in <UNK> and <UNK> meet frankenstein john carradine again plays a sinister dracula baron is his <UNK> at the start of the film and in house of frankenstein <UNK> <UNK> is the sympathetic wolf man and glenn strange returns as the frankenstein monster lionel <UNK> again plays an inspector which he often does in the universal studios monster films a keeper for your collection
<START> this movie over does it on the cgi i mean sci fi really they over did it the original <UNK> is better it does not use cgi like the sequel in this movie its the simple people running from mutated killer bats and really bats in afghanistan the plot involves u s army soldiers finding a terrorist and being attack by bats and dying but the reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because the way the camera <UNK> in on the soldiers the acting is bad and this doesn't even look like a horror movie in all this movie is a fairly good tv movie for sci fi channel but if like sci <UNK> movies you'll like this movie because you just like channel <UNK> oh and if you fall asleep during the movie don't be surprised oh sorry i think i give it 2 stars instead
<START> i must admit i wasn't expecting much on this movie i was surprised i truly enjoyed it as much as i did the script wasn't oscar material but it wasn't horrible either the acting was great by mark <UNK> jennifer aniston had a great supporting role and looked lovely as ever what made this movie for me was the music if you do not like 80's <UNK> metal or hair bands then you probably wont like this movie its all about being a <UNK> some <UNK> were present but didn't bring down the movie at all i would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to stand up and shout 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music br br jason
<START> great music great dancing a sexy star <UNK> and actual sexual desire shown by a female character a very unusual event you rarely see female characters who are motivated primarily by lust and it is a nice change i also think the movie captures very well what it is like to be a teenager <UNK> with issues of class and of having ideals suddenly come up against reality of course it is sappy at moments it is after all a movie musical but all in all it is a real pleasure a fun romance and also politically <UNK> this movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines i carried the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is probably jackie chan's worst movie since the <UNK> in 1985 yes i know that nobody watches his movies for their stories but the plotting of this one is unusually lame even by his standards and while the fight choreography is up to his standards the fight scenes the whole two of them are ruined as others have mentioned by the frenetic distracting <UNK> even the most serious jackie chan fans shouldn't really bother with this <UNK> <UNK> stunt and plug filled garbage anita <UNK> cute and <UNK> performance is one of the few redeeming virtues for a good serious jackie movie i recommend crime story 1 2
<START> this story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner something which sets it apart from most films with this plot mr <UNK> <UNK> cheung has a relationship with <UNK> <UNK> who was also so good in <UNK> in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation he is married for 20 years to <UNK> the great anita in her last role before she was <UNK> taken from us and it appears to be a loving relationship when <UNK> offers to care for hers and mr <UNK> former teacher <UNK> and mr <UNK> have the opportunity to be together what makes the film so good is director ann pacing it takes a while to <UNK> the secrets of the and it all makes sense the movie is very dramatic and touching you don't feel any <UNK> about the teacher student situation something that <UNK> this film above many with the same plot it is slow moving but stay with it also <UNK> in ms wonderful <UNK> but beautiful performance she was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time it is worth the time to witness and just be there with her
<START> br br spoilers br br i'm going to be as kind as i can about this film some people including directors can get quite upset when reviewers speak their mind so br br there is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and that's it everything else bites the big one all the acting is appalling the script is embarrassing the special effects look like they were done by school children on cheap computers all in all this film has serious <UNK> shoe <UNK> br br as a horror film it's not very scary and if it supposed to a thinking man's horror film well it succeeded on some level i kept thinking that the end of this film is an awfully long way away it may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and i'm missing the point but i somehow doubt it br br this is a complete car phone warehouse of a film and i could not recommend it to anyone and it does pain me to say this as i eagerly <UNK> the <UNK> of british horror br br if you don't agree with this review that fine it's just my own opinion and i'm sure someone out there will love it the director's mum for instance
<START> so i was <UNK> during my snakes on a plane weekend after the movie we <UNK> some more why not snakes on a train how bad could it possibly be its snakes probably killing people on trains the snakes were supposed to be first off me and my buddies thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheesy <UNK> sound clip we actually sat through the entire thing completely ready to turn it off we're too lazy to walk over and hit <UNK> next thing we knew we don't know what the heck was going on but something amazingly funny happens at the end it's one of those endings that you'll <UNK> a few times just to squeeze the laughs out because you suffered for so long br br last 10 min a 8 rest of the movie a 2
<START> this film is an <UNK> poetic take on the immigrant experience a <UNK> look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with these are aspects not often considered in movies about <UNK> to america in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the <UNK> and enthusiasm if ignorance that poor illiterate <UNK> immigrants have in anticipation of their <UNK> to the united states br br they have some fantastic unrealistic notions about the united states which are <UNK> on the trip over one is that the rivers run with milk an image which is depicted in the movie to poetic <UNK> effect the film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the <UNK> of the ignorance the locals have about life in america or if not ignorance of it a vision significantly colored with <UNK> and fantasy br br that said the movie depicts with <UNK> realism the boat ride to the united states and the <UNK> process which <UNK> at <UNK> island had to <UNK> the boat ride is imagined as rather dull which surely it was much of the time the quarters in which the <UNK> residents sleep is depicted as extremely crowded with <UNK> <UNK> four or five <UNK> from one another and lacking much light which it was surely the case below deck br br again the film is not <UNK> with <UNK> music or <UNK> bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagining of what it was truly like for people to the united states the villagers may not be <UNK> but they are quite reasonable and the interaction with the <UNK> of the <UNK> with the <UNK> officer who insists on particular results are quite bittersweet <UNK> as they are not <UNK> or <UNK> for the benefit of a <UNK> conclusion and one sees the <UNK> of the realism of <UNK> with the extensive <UNK> which guide life in the united states br br the immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of cold eyed realism and the magical fantasy of <UNK> <UNK> make for a <UNK> vision of the beliefs held by or any people with little <UNK> education moving to the united states the acting is similarly <UNK> it is not at all <UNK> or <UNK> but seems the more realistic for it that said all the main performers in particular <UNK> <UNK> vincenzo <UNK> the clear leader of the group is excellent while never smiling his character's actions speak much <UNK> and it is clear that thankfully the other members of the group his two sons and the above mentioned elder the <UNK> grandmother have faith in his <UNK> abilities and respect his clear <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his character with great decency and and it is a testament to his abilities that his character appears so capable and confident while his character betrays very little emotion br br one <UNK> of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious <UNK> the excellent and <UNK> mysterious charlotte <UNK> who speaks italian and during the entire film we wonder why she is going to the united states or what connection she has to the otherwise <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> group at the end this is finally revealed and the revelation is done typically realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or <UNK> br br the film is directed by <UNK> who has a firm grasp on the realistic if sometimes <UNK> world view his characters inhabit and presents it competently and <UNK> it is in fact fantastically confident given how <UNK> the realism and <UNK> might have combined in the film it is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience
<START> if you want an excellent <UNK> of <UNK> history done in colorful fashion this is for you this documentary would also be excellent for <UNK> who are teaching about roman or medieval history this documentary is divided into three portions first dealing with the fall of the western roman empire the rise of christianity and the beginning of the <UNK> empire the second video deals with <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> controversy the third and final video explains the decline and fall of the series is shot in several countries and beautifully <UNK> <UNK> history into the realities of the modern world showing the place of this civilization as part of human civilization in general do take the time to watch
<START> frank sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best if i had to name the best thing he ever did though it would be his performance as frankie machine the heroin addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved just barely by the love of a good woman played by an exceptionally kim novak the cold turkey scenes between sinatra and novak are terrifying and heartbreaking the movie is very nearly perfect in fact from <UNK> title graphics to the ground breaking jazz score by elmer <UNK> it might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s but it's a must see nevertheless
<START> as i watched this movie i felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head the acting was horribly <UNK> and it was bad acting the most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid out in state in a coffin i felt nothing but relief when it was finally over i was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath all around it was stupid no beginning no climax no ending just rambling on and on and the plastic bag kept getting worse let's get real here this is an awful movie
<START> this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today horribly predictable obscene usage of slow motion photography cheesy story lines chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service <UNK> is really annoying his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment i will give the series some credit though it does get entertaining at times but not enough for it make any difference with all the negative points this series has i still prefer it over reality tv it can't really get any more worthless than that
<START> slasher fare which feels overly long at 80 minutes years ago a bunch of <UNK> who lived in the <UNK> of a mountain were burned up in a forest fire years later <UNK> are going missing from the area of the fire a bunch of horny kids are of course en route to this area for a camping trip of there own despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger jackson <UNK> the kids <UNK> up to the mountain any way before long the kids start to get picked off by the monster who remains unseen to the very end of the movie probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad no surprises to speak of they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies <UNK> leaving the final girl to <UNK> for herself although in a <UNK> downbeat denouement the final girl ends up imprisoned and <UNK> by the monster br br the story itself couldn't hold the weight of feature length so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of <UNK> and insects which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release on the plus side the <UNK> footage is rather nice also among the highlights are <UNK> talking to a baby deer a decent rock climbing death sequence ok gore and the great jackie <UNK> in his final film role as the bumbling local sheriff this is a far cry from charlie chaplin but it was still nice to see him this is for slasher <UNK> only
<START> i really liked this movie number 5 the star robot of the movie gets hit by lightning and some thing happened to his <UNK> he act and thinks more like a human the robot repeats commercials he learns after watching tv he then applies these <UNK> to his circumstances number 5 is quick witted and funny the character <UNK> voices of stars tries to dance like john travolta in staying alive and a lot of other things he has a saying for most of his circumstances that he <UNK> the actions of the robots is really good number 5 wants to drive cook and please with all the characteristics of a human the way the robots move and line up is really hysterical i am disappointed that the writers could not keep this clean for all viewers this movie has a ending something you would not expect i hate movies that have swearing in them even though i like them i give them a lower rating this movie had swearing words jesus christ was used as swearing word which <UNK> me it is used a least 3 times g d d m bull sh t etc it could have been a wonderful movie with out all this offensive language there is no sex in this film some violence like robots blowing up cars and machines
<START> this movie is full of pseudo deep <UNK> and it's <UNK> in its <UNK> that includes a <UNK> ham voice over and some unbelievable dialogue dialogue that is <UNK> and tone deaf the way spike sometimes not always is when writing certain characters for those that like nonsense films like pieces of april and one hour photo this is another one for you br br that said this comment is nothing against ryan <UNK> who has shown his awesome chops in the believer a film that proves that movies are a director's medium and when a movie is rotten it's fair to say the fault lies there and not in the actors
<START> this feeble attempt at <UNK> your typically bland japanese horror movie more towards a creepy cult hit did not have the <UNK> needed to keep the viewer involved throughout translated to <UNK> is about just that an irrational and tribute to the strange <UNK> spiral into <UNK> that has seemingly captivated a whole small town into <UNK> obsessed <UNK> while this certainly makes for a <UNK> b movie on the surface the <UNK> tiresome acting direction and script will have all but asian horror buffs shaking their heads in <UNK> what could have roughly translated into japanese equivalent of an early david lynch piece instead <UNK> out it's <UNK> <UNK> before it even has a chance to explain itself which of course it does not aside from a few clever techniques employed the movie rarely <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> with the dull script ultimately coming across as a cheap exploitation into the cult genre <UNK> hollow imagery for genuine substance when the movie had ended there was hardly anything that was gained from any of the interactions save a tiny few scenes or images that rose above the one note film i do applaud the makers for at least trying to take the genre into more supernatural <UNK> <UNK> and understand the rough <UNK> lost in translation but with zero substance to back any of it's up this will likely be <UNK> to obscure <UNK> <UNK> ridden <UNK>
<START> yes maybe there are parts of this film which require <UNK> belief a little but that doesn't take anything away from the film's charm and wonder it was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the <UNK> favourite which is not surprising the subject matter coming together in a race torn though post apartheid south africa is highly <UNK> and the treatment of the theme is inspirational of course as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter <UNK> these shortcomings i saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children a film to watch <UNK> discuss and act upon
<START> possible spoilers warning br br you never know the guy keeps telling he's an alien but <UNK> seems to be the most human in the whole story arrived from distant planet said weird things advanced the <UNK> science <UNK> the doctor or was it just a crazy dream you never know better see k <UNK> for yourself think br br great acting of all the cast don't forget to notice the music it's right in a place lot of fun some sadness 8 of 10 after all
<START> while the romance in this film is an important aspect it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern indian all of the major characters were well fleshed out and had their own inner life i recommend this strongly
<START> while sleeping mr <UNK> is assigned by his brother <UNK> in a dream to go with john locke to <UNK> the meaning of the symbol with the <UNK> of chasing henry mr <UNK> brings john with him and they find a second <UNK> called pearl underground the question mark symbol marked on the field where a video explains that the other <UNK> is a psychological experiment and people behavior <UNK> the buttons of the computer every <UNK> minutes are actually subjects meanwhile jack <UNK> tries to save <UNK> br br in this episode john locke loses his faith in the island when he finds that they have been <UNK> in the <UNK> the disgusting michael sees the <UNK> <UNK> wishing that she was dead while <UNK> jack kate and <UNK> are suffering her pain in a deep emotional contrast my vote is eight br br title brazil not available
<START> overall a well done movie there were the parts that made me <UNK> and there were the parts that i threw my hands up at but i came away with something more than i gone in with br br i think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition without spoiling it let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in <UNK> is way beyond what this movie stands for the <UNK> is an epic not a 200 page book that puts down women in india the movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive indian family while the basic <UNK> of the <UNK> laws of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative india let me assure my reader that i having lived in <UNK> for 12 years found entire parts that just did not ring those <UNK> i mean some things and some actions are very true but some other stuff is just way off the mark especially today br br <UNK> is complicated india is complicated the director tries to <UNK> both and fails pretty miserably at that br br why in english can you imagine a movie about american indians in english or the french speaking in english seriously jarring even the servant spoke in <UNK> <UNK> english albeit with a hint of <UNK> in the language for believability br br but the chemistry between the leads is <UNK> if you like it hot this is a movie for you i think that is the biggest saving grace the development of a true real life love story br br if this film was about <UNK> and <UNK> then it would have got full marks from me and in being about them it could have made a subtle statement but this movie goes out there to say this is what india is and this is what indian society is like and in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails just take everything you see with a <UNK> of salt the dark secrets of india are not being revealed just two girls are falling in love just like it happens everywhere else
<START> part of the bbc filming of all of shakespeare's classic plays this version of hamlet does nothing to <UNK> my particular impression that it is one of shakespeare's most over rated plays and hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character i feel no sympathy for him and i didn't after watching this br br even when you have great actors like the great derek <UNK> in the role of the <UNK> and patrick stewart as <UNK> and jonathan hyde as <UNK> it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline and when a good actor like <UNK> <UNK> passion into it he <UNK> the entire role incomprehensible i just could not connect his of the character to what he was saying and this killed it for me that said he does get the to be or not to be speech right as his actions with a <UNK> make clear the character's <UNK> intentions at that point in the play br br the supporting roles to me better written and consequently better played are enjoyable notably <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and stewart's well detailed interpretation of <UNK> br br at four and a half hours it is very long and best watched in bite sized <UNK> check it out if you're interested but be prepared for a long watch
<START> this columbo is unique in that we don't really know the exact outcome until the very end our favorite dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers of killing their rich uncle each points the finger at his brother in a mystery series in which the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama this twist could reasonably be used only once or twice and this was <UNK> time other than that <UNK> this episode fits in well with others of the series it has a lighter tone than some with a very funny performance by <UNK> nolan as the <UNK> and loyal <UNK> who takes an instant dislike to columbo
<START> like almost everyone i am familiar with the music of ray charles who hasn't heard georgia on my mind and the mess around and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie but about the life of ray charles i was sadly ignorant until watching this i have to say that jamie foxx brought ray charles to life brilliantly his performance was powerful right down to the mannerisms and voice <UNK> the movie also offered a no holds <UNK> account of some of the trials and <UNK> charles dealt with over the course of his life and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into <UNK> perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin <UNK> scene which was painfully realistic the movie portrays <UNK> growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement culminating in his <UNK> to play before a <UNK> audience in georgia which led to a <UNK> on him performing in the state his drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented the movie revolves around a <UNK> from his mother when he was a child don't let anyone or anything turn you into a <UNK> the point is that drugs did just that and to honour his mother's memory he had to beat them there's not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point this is really powerful stuff 9 10
<START> first <UNK> runs town and country and now this the difference between that stinker and this pink <UNK> rip off is that town and country was watchable this isn't br br i can only <UNK> that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else's dime belushi is especially irritating his scene with candy doing a z grade dom <UNK> was torture speaking of torture five minutes of the talentless shepherd and i bet the prisoners at <UNK> would crack like <UNK> br br the real crime besides this being green <UNK> is <UNK> character a <UNK> wife who takes a <UNK> <UNK> casino for a half million bucks if you buy that i have some <UNK> property in arizona you might be interested in
<START> ok film like <UNK> last few films once again goes beyond the knock 'em down kick 'em in the <UNK> shoot 'em in the face get revenge against the bad guys for hurting my sister's <UNK> cousin stuff seagal was into for a while steven started thinking and using his bucks to make movies with actual ideas in them sure there is plenty of action in this flick but also some thought and heart it's not an oscar flick but well worth the effort unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second it's worth a rental or two
<START> anybody who goes to the manhattan hospital center is taking his life in his hands that includes the staff of the hospital br br i had never seen the hospital before and i was intrigued at how similar the characters and situations of the plot were to that other <UNK> masterpiece network there are elements in george c scott's character that have both al <UNK> and howard br br he's the <UNK> of the hospital and he's mad as hell and not going to take it any more he's completely estranged from his wife and kids it takes a faye <UNK> type character in the person of diana <UNK> to make him snap out of it one roll in the <UNK> with her and he's shocked back to reality and the fact he still can contribute in the world br br but first he's got a real problem someone is out killing hospital staff four of them in a 48 hour period and the nice part is their deaths can be attributed to in large part to the general incompetence of a medical <UNK> that's where the comedy comes in br br there is an actual howard <UNK> type character in the person of <UNK> hughes diana <UNK> father his end is not quite as dramatic as though br br back in my working days it was part of my job to pay medical <UNK> some of them could be as big creeps as you'll find portrayed in the hospital the black comedy satire had some real bite to it for me br br george c scott was nominated for best actor but having won and refused to accept the previous year's oscar for <UNK> he wasn't about to get a second chance he lost to gene hackman for the french connection still his handling of the role is unforgettable br br try viewing the hospital back to back with network and see how many similarities you spot
<START> typical story of an evil kid going after people i suspect that antonio <UNK> <UNK> bear on <UNK> and <UNK> and vincent <UNK> didn't want to stress this junk on their <UNK> actually <UNK> left this life with a mostly good resume sometimes i wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month note that comment is not to be taken seriously i just think that slashers have lost their touch br br anyway this is one movie that you'll do best to avoid it's ninety minutes to two hours that i'll never get back
<START> the fifth collaboration between marlene <UNK> and director <UNK> von <UNK> blonde <UNK> is a film that looks great while it's playing but fails to <UNK> the viewer the plodding storyline of <UNK> being torn between two men becoming a <UNK> <UNK> star and fighting for the custody of her child is <UNK> and often feels like bits of three separate films half baked together <UNK> is <UNK> cast in a rather passive <UNK> role for much of the film and her character remains <UNK> from viewers while herbert <UNK> is unconvincing as her ill <UNK> husband and cary grant is largely wasted as a suave <UNK> who <UNK> in and out of the picture the film does contain some intriguing set pieces the hot voodoo number is the high point that are <UNK> <UNK> for this era in hollywood although it proves to no <UNK> in such a dull incoherent film
<START> nostalgia isn't always the best reason to watch a movie more often than not the movies you loved as a kid will disappoint you as an adult while there are exceptions to this rule it's hard to justify <UNK> a dvd of <UNK> regardless of how many insightful the director's commentary may be but stay sharp gen x because the dozens of <UNK> <UNK> your trip down memory lane might stop you from stumbling across one worth <UNK> br br one surprise film worth another look is joel <UNK> the supernatural thriller starring 80's popcorn <UNK> <UNK> sutherland kevin bacon julia roberts and billy baldwin you would think that a <UNK> comprised of this cast the flamboyant flair of <UNK> and the <UNK> slick eye of cinematographer jan de <UNK> would result in something <UNK> <UNK> but aside ain't half bad even though it's production design is inexplicably over the top and the photography is <UNK> over stylized <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> streets <UNK> endless <UNK> of steam still manages to be an effectively dark and compelling thriller if there's an explanation why was forgotten it might be because 1990 saw the release of another far superior supernatural thriller <UNK> ladder br br had been released a year or two after <UNK> ladder it's likely <UNK> flashy thriller would have been <UNK> as a toned down <UNK> rip off of adrian <UNK> nightmarish masterpiece but with these films being released in the same year enjoyed a different fate take at the box office despite being a watered down version of a similar premise the passage of time hasn't been as kind to it has been lost <UNK> a dated heap of throwaway 80's brat pack dreck while has <UNK> its reputation as a timeless classic <UNK> aside is <UNK> terrifying and it manages to keep audiences guessing right up until the last frame whereas falls victim to over <UNK> and hollywood <UNK> that drag down the final act into a predictably <UNK> denouement comparisons between the two movies is unfair and ultimately <UNK> ability to represent the 80's at its quintessential best released at the end of a decade of shallow excess will always be dated by its <UNK> and clothing styles but in fairness it should also be remembered as a well executed movie at or at least near the top of its particular heap of dreck for <UNK> and purposes it's an entertaining walk down memory lane
<START> i was looking forward to <UNK> contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from showtime but this was easily the worst of the bunch it's really too bad part of this may be due to the poor if odd choice of source <UNK> why joe didn't just write an original i have no idea instead we get this <UNK> episode where the message <UNK> the script the characters the staging everything and by the end i was just wondering whether it could get any worse and i won't spoil it but it ended up getting worse what a stinker by such a talented creative team skip this one and buy the john carpenter one instead it manages to balance all of the elements horror humor character vision and it's fun <UNK> is about as fun as having a bear take a dump on you while you sleep
<START> as i expected would happen too many reviews of this film from professionals and amateurs alike have focused as much if not more on the film's ideology that's because the sea inside aka <UNK> is a film about <UNK> specifically it's a true story about an infamous named <UNK> who fought for many years for the right to <UNK> suicide who was denied that right by the spanish <UNK> court and who well i don't want to ruin the ending of the film for you br br the real life <UNK> a national debate on <UNK> in spain now with producer director writer composer editor <UNK> <UNK> los <UNK> 1997 and the others 2001 biopic the sea inside another <UNK> aid has been provided in the international debate on this hot button issue br br but as i keep saying to deaf ears your opinion pro or con on the film's ideology shouldn't affect your rating of the film you're not supposed to be rating the philosophical or political messages that <UNK> wants to make you're supposed to be rating the film as a film maybe that's a bit too idealistic as none of us can likely completely divorce our <UNK> from our <UNK> <UNK> but idealistic or not that's the goal br br so forget about the philosophical and political issues for a moment as a film <UNK> has turned in one of his most elegant and mature works to date he does not focus on societal <UNK> he does not focus on legal political struggles he focuses on as a man living out his days confined to a bed in his brother's home br br played here in an amazing performance by <UNK> <UNK> was a as the film begins he has been a for 26 years that condition was brought about as <UNK> shows us through <UNK> shot flashbacks by a diving accident was distracted by a beautiful woman <UNK> the water <UNK> in <UNK> his neck and almost drowned as a he eventually began writing poetry some of which was published in a book entitled el <UNK> letters from hell in real life book became a best <UNK> in spain perhaps taking artistic work as a cue <UNK> has created an <UNK> poetic film br br most of the sea inside is set inside bedroom the focus in these scenes is complex and sublime performance as a <UNK> is limited to moving his head and talking he has <UNK> subtle changes of expression and <UNK> to convey a deep character with a <UNK> intellectual approach to life <UNK> and <UNK> have often <UNK> philosophical in understated speech but there's always a combination of a wicked sense of humor passion for the aesthetic including music and women and a sadness and even occasionally <UNK> not far below the surface different underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the ocean br br the people <UNK> with most frequently <UNK> this in complex ways these others include his sister in law mabel <UNK> who has been his chief caretaker since accident his brother <UNK> who is one of the vocal <UNK> to wish to die and with whom there is an underlying <UNK> issue it seems like maybe <UNK> was the one to save from drowning his nephew <UNK> who is perhaps the most understanding towards him a right to die <UNK> clara a pro <UNK> lawyer julia <UNK> whom he wanted because she had a <UNK> disease cerebral <UNK> with and and would thus by more <UNK> and who he falls in love with and <UNK> lola a local woman who works at a and <UNK> as a dj who heard about him from the media who wants to convince him to desire to live and who falls in love with him br br the bulk of the film consists of these characters <UNK> with in his room there are also a few other <UNK> characters including father who remains oddly distant and a notorious and media conscious priest <UNK> francisco <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who does his best to change mind via philosophy <UNK> in a scene often <UNK> <UNK> as comic it has an attendant comic element but the scene is primarily very serious br br that most of the film takes place in room <UNK> gives the couple significant changes in setting greater impact room has a nice big window which he says he is satisfied with as an observation point on the world maybe even more importantly he regularly <UNK> the window as a <UNK> pad through which he flies across the <UNK> to the ocean which he always loved and which has been the most influential force in his life it provided his living when he was younger and took his <UNK> away <UNK> gives us a <UNK> sequence of imagining one of his <UNK> to the sea it is beautifully shot with low angles presumably from a helicopter of the hills <UNK> by until we follow a stream to the wide open ocean which in this film represents freedom the <UNK> and natural forces br br the other significant change of setting arrives with finally taking to a wheelchair he otherwise refused them saying they <UNK> his <UNK> to make an appearance in court to help <UNK> his case <UNK> gives us a poignant melancholy <UNK> shot <UNK> of viewing life and the world in action from the car window br br whether you agree with <UNK> or not it's difficult to deny that this is a well acted well scripted and well constructed film you may not believe that it's a ten and that's even more unlikely if you disagree with <UNK> but it's still worth watching as a fine example of artistic sophisticated film making
<START> this movie is a perfect example of <UNK> cinematic gifts to the horror monster genre i thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of the <UNK> and comic books or actually the comics may have come second i forget this movie was made for barker fans it helps to have read the book beforehand but isn't that important if you can follow a film i saw to anyone who is on the fence about this film read the book then re watch the film you might find a new respect for the movie i came to this movie a big fan of barker already and having read the book prior loved the film instantly there are great cameos makeup writing directing etc in this film this movie does something that most monster horror movies fail miserably at show the monsters they are there in full color not hidden in shadows and taking most of the screen time unlike other films that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature this movie <UNK> the grotesque and casts them into the <UNK> as the good guy two thumbs up clive we're waiting for the thief of always
<START> for the people who have compared this trash to the brilliance of david lynch etc please listen to your <UNK> when they say dont use other people's pc without their <UNK> br br this is complete and utter poo there is no art here this is some person trying to make a name for himself with a <UNK> of gross out ideas which he was not clever enough to <UNK> into one main idea so instead he went for the easy option br br any one with half a brain could sit at home and <UNK> up some controversial images to shock viewers but it takes a person with true imagination to be able to make it into a movie people want to watch br br i am a lover of shock cinema i have seen or own pretty much all you can get and i can strongly advise to anyone who loves the world of movies to steer well clear of this garbage br br this one is only for people who like to over analyze what they are watching or for the 17 year old first time <UNK> who dont know any better br br 0 10 br br
<START> spoilers <UNK> enough i have actually seen the film that this horrid film was a sequel to it was called <UNK> the fighting eagle and i saw it when i was just 8 years old it made such an awful impression on me that i never forgot it i've been an mst3k fan for a long time so when came out on tape i bought it i was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the wretched <UNK> movie that i'd seen so long ago costume has somehow gotten ever <UNK> than the last time i saw him how can he wear that tiny little bikini doesn't he care that it shows off the fact that he has no <UNK> package and poor <UNK> he gets no lines and no girl and has to follow that <UNK> haired <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> around all the time has anyone else noticed that miles <UNK> walks like a woman no wonder he's not interested in the pretty if somewhat lackluster the evil but bad guy is more to his taste i'm sure i loved cardboard <UNK> painted <UNK> helmet and the way he spent all his time trying to touch some part of <UNK> the fight scenes are so badly choreographed that its a wonder that the swords ever manage to connect the dull old guy spends all of his time standing around looking depressed <UNK> drinks from a cup given to him by a guy who hates him and then looks surprised that they drugged him he must be pretty smart though he invented a hang <UNK> in the space <UNK> five minutes then flew it into a <UNK> in the space time <UNK> so that he <UNK> briefly into <UNK> century <UNK> that was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet of course and saved the post <UNK> while she sat around doing absolutely nothing the real hero of the movie was <UNK> who saved <UNK> several times from his <UNK> and killed the evil in the bargain kudos to <UNK> the only competent person in the whole film
<START> the credits at the end read all directed by <UNK> that's a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several projects were thrown together somehow barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work it more felt like one of those music clip things that are <UNK> as feature films to cash in on those video commercials just that here we have the <UNK> music and the live performances missing except for one scene which may as well be <UNK> as a weird music video clip in japan whatever br br it makes zero sense visually it isn't too special either although it has its moments for example the female creature with the death <UNK> who is <UNK> onto a bed base and some <UNK> sh t throughout and it certainly has an industrial y feeling to it usually i'd call the effects <UNK> but what this film offers in this regard is <UNK> more than anything else you remember those cheap video effects from 70's and 80's music videos that make them look so dated like a picture within a picture flying through the screen there is quite a lot of these kind of effects in this and without any apparent reason the most half <UNK> seeming effort comes in the form of a picture <UNK> the pictures sort of look like album covers whatever br br i don't know what's up with the subtitles of the version i saw the chinese ones or whatever those <UNK> are sometimes seem to show up when nothing is even said and the english ones often show up without the chinese ones the english <UNK> talk much about life without death is it possible and a mind without a body which provides what comes closest to a <UNK> conflict between characters in this film one guy a scientist dude says that life without flesh is death while another guy a <UNK> dude who claims his mind is beyond his body now that he got the death <UNK> blown into his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and <UNK> <UNK> dude is <UNK> p <UNK> off about the scientist <UNK> claim whatever br br <UNK> the end all written by perception de ambiguity
<START> i saw this on mystery science theater 3000 and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures of course you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old but i've seen <UNK> that were better the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes the cameraman apparently doesn't know what a <UNK> is and had too much coffee or something harder maybe because the camera is always shaking around i couldn't even follow the plot but suffice it to say this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life br br update i saw epic movie a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2 it's not the worst movie i've ever seen anymore
<START> i loved this film almost as much as the <UNK> version what teenager doesn't go through what going through wanting to find independence by getting more and more distant from your family the songs were nice to and the character designs were great lady and tramp look almost exactly like they did in the <UNK> feature they did a good job on the voices of those two too considering the fact that the <UNK> voice actors are probably dead however i do think they should've given more lines to lady <UNK> <UNK> and daniel oh well at least they had the common sense to keep the same scenery from the original film
<START> i have to be honest i really had a good time watching she's the man despite it being a typical teenage comedy or if you will the switching of the <UNK> movie it had some pretty decent laughs that i think anyone could get adults and teens alike would over all enjoy this movie br br amanda <UNK> is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a guy and when she is turned down to try out for the boy's soccer team she decides to take over her brother's appearance to prove herself worthy of being on the boy's soccer team of course love shows itself when she meets another guy who thinks she's her brother she also has a girl who is chasing after her well the tag line says it all br br this is a fun little teen drama that i think will be remembered for a while amanda <UNK> did prove something in the film it's really hard to really act like a guy d well it's true br br 8 10
<START> the bridge the sound of is one of the best music documentaries that i have seen lately and is more than a film about music it is also a musical love <UNK> about a fabulous city one of the greatest city in europe and the world one of the most important cities for europe history and for islam the city that may bridge in the future europe and the middle east or may <UNK> once again as is already happened in history the <UNK> between two worlds br br then there is the music the interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music and we hear a lot of good rock and rap in the first third of the film an then like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots to turkish traditional music to commercial romances and to the exotic <UNK> that are basic elements in the landscape of turkish music in such a complex and conflict ridden country as turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the <UNK> especially the <UNK> one one of the best musical moments is actually provided by a <UNK> singer with a fantastic voice singing in a <UNK> shaped turkish bath br br one gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film i have never been to <UNK> but after having seen this film i am sure that i want to visit this place soon
<START> two hands is a hilarious australian gangster movie set in really <UNK> sydney i bet tourists never sydney and <UNK> to look like it did in this film all <UNK> bodies oppressive <UNK> and gangsters in shorts and heath ledger plays an amateur boxer with an eye on becoming part of the local king's cross <UNK> gang he looked rather magnificent in his green wife <UNK> and blue <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does become him i always had him down as a home away boy and he has been in that soap which is a little <UNK> than the insipid <UNK> the film is really worth watching for its combination of <UNK> humour and nasty violence the drowning scene is expected to give me nightmares soon <UNK> awards country girl love interest city brother and <UNK>
<START> stay alive stay alive stay alive i am called the attention it was the trailer and not the <UNK> br br the topic of the movie <UNK> on a video i play that was created by a <UNK> to kill the people and to live <UNK> is acceptable br br first that quite bad movie of horror the blood sees more or less <UNK> spread <UNK> these scenes is <UNK> they are the more bad br br but actually indeed that bad is this movie very very bad but bad in all the aspects br br i do not recommend this movie to anybody trailer well movie bad br br i do not deal since as like they spend <UNK> money and time doing these senseless movies and too bad
<START> <UNK> de only reason for existence is it's local popularity it has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years and still counting br br it deals about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis amateur every storyline deals with the same subject some <UNK> that takes ridiculous and predictable proportions to get resolved in the end br br the show's been running for over 15 years now and the production probably decided not to change a winning team which means that the show has had minor changes over the course of years besides a couple of actors getting replaced they nearly all left by themselves rather than being thrown of the show the humor hasn't changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it first aired in the first place br br i guess you have to be <UNK> to get this and over 60 years old to enjoy such an old fashioned tv show as this
<START> a real <UNK> soap opera here as spencer tracy <UNK> the role of an illiterate until the age of 20 he marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition and his drive leads him to success br br success but no happiness here a do well son and a <UNK> marriage leads to disaster and tragedy tracy buys a <UNK> and succeeds only to be subjected to a disastrous <UNK> strike and the death of workers br br the film appeared at the beginning to be uneven but is <UNK> thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here br br a double separate suicide here we know that <UNK> can't buy happiness but this is a little too far fetched nonetheless we have riveting performances by tracy and <UNK> moore ms <UNK> as the 2nd wife is also quite effective
<START> favourite from the first run of season 10 and also one of my personal favourites features the adventure of al gore before going on global warming and before the movie it was similar a adventure certainly al gore was also trying to aware the world about something that can change the earth something really dangerous this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig al gore had only one thing in mind to aware everyone of and to kill it al gore here is more than hilarious everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish doing <UNK> since nobody believes him but he is just a f demented bastard basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of al gore but certainly he don't have that in his mind there's not space for any other subject is just what concerns al gore those four kids are <UNK> kenny kyle and stan basically stan felt sorry for al gore and the four boys were just playing in al <UNK> game never <UNK> that gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill hilarious scene they are just children damned so at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for al gore and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious <UNK> episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of <UNK> after he finds a treasure inside the cave certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick <UNK> in both senses he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us and in the end al gore does killed this character is a fantastic one and i'm <UNK> terrific fun in this episode a highly re watchable one 10 out of 10
<START> this movie probably isn't the funniest i've ever seen and it certainly doesn't have much redeeming value in fact it is really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose plot however this make it up as i go along attitude actually works to the film's advantage tommy boy succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that the snl skits <UNK> and spade starred in succeeded their well timed <UNK> silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their <UNK>
<START> i know one is not supposed to comment on other comments but i will say that a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew quite a lot about the manhattan project and were annoyed at things that were left out from his book in it appears the original screenwriter bruce robinson is another such i knew very little before watching the film however and found it dwight <UNK> is absolutely <UNK> as <UNK> a truly <UNK> charismatic presence an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why he isn't given better roles and more leading parts john cusack and paul newman are excellent as always one could <UNK> with various script or direction choices but as it is the film is extremely intense and horrific at times and overall i give it four stars out of five
<START> joe was first released in the us in the summer of 1970 despite respectable notices reasonable box office and an oscar <UNK> it <UNK> shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the 1980's before being <UNK> <UNK> somewhat <UNK> in the us in the late 90's thanks to this lengthy its reputation has gone on to see it placed inexplicably alongside the likes of michael <UNK> original death wish although revenge is a theme a film about <UNK> this most definitely is not br br the plot isn't worth <UNK> its a <UNK> hammy and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that <UNK> out of it that relationship and the largely class based quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature these two and their situation bear absolutely no relation to reality br br almost everything about the film is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> which makes the whole thing completely fascinating hippies are depicted as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around <UNK> with <UNK> on your face and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly its very much a film of the 60's rather than the 70's so why some industry <UNK> have begun to include it in <UNK> conversations about the <UNK> of the hollywood new wave is a complete mystery martin <UNK> of all people even got involved though probably only to give a nod to the <UNK> <UNK> of the grim urban cinematography which almost certainly influenced taxi driver four years later but joe seems very much like a furious <UNK> against the likes of easy rider and bonnie and clyde rather than a <UNK> of that same <UNK> cinematic <UNK> br br it isn't a film of any real artistic significance despite <UNK> fury at everything in his world it remains a story about absolutely nothing but its value as a cultural museum piece is <UNK> shot on and around the streets of new york city during the darkest hours of the vietnam war and at a time when america and significantly its cinema was being <UNK> to the horror of the old guard the film ends up in its own completely oblivious and accidental way saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly to capture it br br but as a film despite a really surprising and effective shock ending this is basically a michael winner film but not as well made how does that <UNK> your fancy incidentally if you are like me a fan of <UNK> <UNK> background then check out harold <UNK> at 1 22 11 in the <UNK> art gallery
<START> we are taken to a <UNK> store where nick is looking at <UNK> in his hand <UNK> if he can get the special a <UNK> cents 20 ounce cup of coffee that comes with a free <UNK> he decides to go for the larger size which of course is more expensive plus it doesn't qualify him for the cake he tries to argue with the indian clerk at the register who keeps her ground with her it's a matter of principle well nick gets irritated not getting his own way and proceeds to kill her br br the tone of the story is set from the start the people we are about to meet are not nice guys there are nick his girlfriend dallas and their partner billy hill they are drug dealers nick decides to visit <UNK> his friend and former partner in crime in <UNK> he wants to do one more <UNK> and then go to paris with the <UNK> from selling the drugs he is bringing what he doesn't realize is that <UNK> has gone straight he is an architect married to christine and wants to adopt a baby br br <UNK> doesn't appreciate his former friend bringing drugs into the house he decides to get rid of the stuff by <UNK> them down the kitchen drain the <UNK> arrival of ice a pizza delivery man takes <UNK> by surprise this man has been sent to kill him but before that <UNK> brings out some <UNK> to share with ice who has a talent for <UNK> br br it is at this point that dr <UNK> the man from the <UNK> agency arrives <UNK> <UNK> shows a two year gap that he can't justify <UNK> begins to doubt about the <UNK> father at this time dallas makes an entrance she is a woman that asks questions point blank like when she demands to know whether <UNK> enjoys watching porn <UNK> who is <UNK> ends up leaving in a <UNK> dallas has decided to seduce <UNK> at all costs there is a surprise in store as billy hill enters the picture and he doesn't like what he sees shooting dallas in the process billy hill has also come to off <UNK> but he is <UNK> br br <UNK> gets the visit of who wants to get his money from nick in his absence he'll take it from <UNK> gives a <UNK> and <UNK> makes up his mind to <UNK> all these low lives he has all the parties come to his house at an <UNK> hour and the different <UNK> will take care of themselves in the end <UNK> has a better plan that includes taking christine for a stay in paris br br never having heard about <UNK> we were drawn into it because of the talent in it skip woods directed his own material this seems to be a film with good intentions at times the film remember others of the same genre not a sin by any shape or form which seems to be the main <UNK> of the negative comments left here in the imdb site for starters <UNK> shows a witty skip woods that has gone to write other films notably <UNK> the screenplay is divided in chapters with suggestive titles <UNK> to the action denis <UNK> does wonders with the mostly interior photography br br thomas jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his <UNK> although hard to imagine he has beat the odds and made something out of himself this actor seen recently in the television series hung is one of the actors we don't tire of watching a dark haired aaron is a welcome addition to any film he is a <UNK> criminal that shows no redeeming qualities or anything close to <UNK> and doesn't hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme james <UNK> has nothing to do same goes for a gorgeous creature that is only a distraction or an <UNK> to add a sexy angle we enjoyed glenn plummer who appears as ice he does a mean audition on the <UNK> michael <UNK> and mickey rourke also appear
<START> having a close experience with one such patient is probably the best reason why i had my heart <UNK> throughout the entire film intense sensible moral and revealing and don't forget to check out the marvellous sound track really good
<START> i remember watching this series <UNK> and being so disappointed when it came to an end over the years since then i have tried to find out if i could obtain a copy of it on either video or d v d to no <UNK> however i was delighted to find this website with details of it only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase that the videos available will not play on english <UNK> this production was so wonderful being absolutely accurate with novel taking the storyline through after the end of the war with joe and subsequent life together absolutely marvellous and i just wish i were able to see it again as since it's original screening there have been no repeats of it on british television
<START> i watched this movie or part of it in hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was but it soon became clear that this was just plain silly for one you have the worst acting ever the lead actress <UNK> is terrible uninspired and hardly even attractive and she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt but she does and whats with the feminist attitude it's plain <UNK> for one her family was killed by a women then she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn how to fight men she then joins up with a fat servant and his child king whose city was destroyed by those two characters are just plain stupid and destroys the little of atmosphere that the movie managed to create after this i could not take any more of <UNK> painful acting and the stupid clichés and lack of some real action br br <UNK> as was the only part of this movie which actually made it remotely watchable br br i liked the conan movie but this is pure crap
<START> this is a delightful they don't make em like this anymore kind of film well performed by everyone and <UNK> with interesting character actors an intelligent witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor holds up for repeated <UNK> viewings br br warning the re make of this film with the same name directed by arnold is an unbearable mess painful to watch without a <UNK> of the charm and wit of the original
<START> okay sure this movie is a bit on the hokey side it's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility dolph lundgren as the <UNK> anyone but this tries very hard i've never read the actual comic book but that doesn't really matter i suppose i judge a film mainly on its merits not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea unless its a film based on a true story that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating because it tries it tries very hard in my book that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film br br many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus it seems everybody has their take on vampire <UNK> be it the cross the silver the <UNK> the <UNK> to <UNK> whatever some of those ideas are included here the storyline is familiar a group of vampires <UNK> to take over the world with one person mainly standing in their way blade wesley snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the <UNK> masses who have slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with <UNK> for the most part the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them the vampires have even taken <UNK> people who <UNK> to be vampires and do the <UNK> dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned br br now that i think of it there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the <UNK> <UNK> film they live a hidden enemy hidden group of people plotting against them the fight to save human kind all that is present in blade as well br br the acting isn't the best here snipes is at best only slightly better than some of his other roles wright a relative newcomer isn't too bad kris kristofferson is forgettable as <UNK> sidekick he's to blade what chip is to the <UNK> stephen <UNK> does the best job of the whole cast here as the head vampire you just love to hate br br i don't know but i just loved the special effects in this film from the blood <UNK> vampire style rave all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film the special effects aren't half bad there's certainly enough blood and gore to go around but after all this is a vampire movie right the various <UNK> and sorts of <UNK> blade uses are fairly unique and not generally used in contemporary action films snipes has more flair with a <UNK> out sword than he does with say a machine gun plus there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away unless of course you are indiana jones br br overall this isn't the best action film ever made but it's not half bad either as a bonus the musical score soundtrack are pretty cool too tell me in what other movies can you hear super like source direct or br br my rating 8 10
<START> this little known comedy from the hit play by ruth gordon is a delight the script based on the play is <UNK> rich and completely <UNK> <UNK> the cast but i must <UNK> the work of the leading lady irene dunne irene is simply superb as usual and lights up the screen with every frame she's in and she's in it a lot thank heaven in addition director <UNK> has given her some unusual close ups that are mesmerizing what a gal i know of no other hollywood actress from any era who has her <UNK> and is so convincing in every film why she remains so little known is a mystery i have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise even for a solid id fan like myself see it everyone
<START> just got this in the mail and i was positively surprised as a big fan of 70's cinema it doesn't take much to satisfy me when it comes to these kind of flicks despite the obvious low budget on this movie the acting is overall good and you can already see why <UNK> was to become on of the greatest actors ever i'm not sure how authentic this movie is but it sure is a good contribution to the mob genre
<START> writer director <UNK> takes a universal and potentially <UNK> subject friendship and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce despite a list actors fine cinematography and elegant production design it's all in the plot and the plot is laughable teach me how to be likable art dealer <UNK> daniel <UNK> tells a random stranger <UNK> and that about sums it up we learn next to nothing about friendship and daniel <UNK> may be a fine actor but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut throat <UNK> the script depends on him to be just as we hope the travesty is over pulls one of his usual <UNK> third acts fast <UNK> from damage to disaster like <UNK> greek <UNK> everyone and everything in this movie is a fake only asset is julie in the part of business partner catherine looking <UNK> and sexy despite a major <UNK> of a <UNK>
<START> it's always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat <UNK> for the future of an actor in this case i was intrigued by edward g <UNK> statement to barbara stanwyck i promised you the valley as he <UNK> the lone hold outs to his attempt to control all the land in ten years later stanwyck would star as the <UNK> of the <UNK> family on the big valley somehow i thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture i guess all those bright <UNK> and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out one's youthful side br br as for my summary line above that's lee <UNK> of john <UNK> glenn ford one of those hold outs mentioned earlier shortly after <UNK> uses his knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of hands after they raid his ranch and torch his home i liked the way the film explored his character starting with the way he dealt with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> richard <UNK> in a <UNK> showdown the set up for the <UNK> was also a clever <UNK> <UNK> opposed to the <UNK> of <UNK> the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing for that <UNK> also had something to say never meet the enemy on his terms br br the violent men is a good title for this film and was probably at the head of it's class in the mid 1950's though by today's standards doesn't come close to the blood letting one will find in a <UNK> or open range where the bullets exact a nasty <UNK> but it's shaped by fine performances from the principals with a sub plot exploring infidelity that seemed almost ironic considering it was <UNK> character who was cheating
<START> if you want to see the true vile nature of communism watch the movie dark blue world <UNK> it <UNK> how the brave czech pilots who refused to surrender <UNK> to england to join the fight against the nazis after the war the <UNK> feared they had picked up dangerous western ideas about freedom so they had these heroic czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison where some of the guards were the same nazis they <UNK> their lives to defeat br br if hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat they should compare the character drama portions of pearl harbor with this movie in dark blue world you really make a connection to all the characters in pearl harbor everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person br br there are <UNK> instances of brilliant writing in this movie one funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character <UNK> is being taught english by a rather <UNK> <UNK> when he can't <UNK> a word he <UNK> the lesson in typical stoic english fashion the teacher <UNK> but <UNK> confronts <UNK> and <UNK> him into behaving br br the <UNK> battle sequences in this movie are amazing and they help to keep the movie lively i read that it cost 11 000 an hour to rent the planes but it was worth every penny br br ladies you are expected to cry at sad movies but guys beware this movie would make general <UNK> <UNK> and if you are a dog lover you'll use up half a box of <UNK> don't say i didn't warn you
<START> this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen br br i hated it so much i wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was normally bad movies are no big deal but something about this one if you hated it you really hate it br br if anyone liked this you probably enjoyed baby geniuses i thought i could never find a movie that was worse then that one i guess not
<START> the slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights there was a certain <UNK> ex <UNK> <UNK> to the resolution of the cliffhanger but it was a good start for all that as is now common with this doctor the moral <UNK> and emotional <UNK> of his actions were centre stage they were always there in the classic series but they were a side issue to be <UNK> over when the doctor was in the heat of battle this <UNK> even says sorry to a during the battle this episode finally shows mickey <UNK> the heroic side that had been hinted at in previous episodes his journey from zero to hero is complete and it has been an utterly convincing one with scares humour and scenes that brought a <UNK> to your throat this episode had everything after much consideration i can finally say that the new series <UNK> the classic series in every single respect coming from a die hard you can get no better recommendation than that
<START> this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen me and my husband own over <UNK> dvds most of which are sci fi and horror b movies that aren't top quality but still entertaining dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities at all the writing was horrific and the acting was even worse it took us a 3 tries to get through the entire movie because we could only tolerate it in 30 minute <UNK> we thought surely it must get better we were wrong i would rather watch a corpse being <UNK> than to have to sit through that again when it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like uh is that it the ending seemed like there was supposed to be more but they ran over their apparent 500 00 budget and were like oh crap we are broke end it now quick roll credits
<START> i was ready for a <UNK> tiger style movie and all i got was the worst movie i've seen in years it was almost as bad as baron von dead script dead acting dead everything br br granted there was some good fight scenes but the positive side ends there if this movie arrives in your house run to a phone and <UNK> <UNK> and say please help there is a movie in my house meant to force people to commit suicide
<START> inane awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to <UNK> or better uses non <UNK> to <UNK> his <UNK> fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to after viewing this junk you will see why br br what a ridiculous name south <UNK> <UNK> of technology you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the <UNK> of this school of nonsense problem with these type of films is that in the end the non <UNK> becomes the accepted mode br br let's step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is excessive manipulative junk
<START> this film is bad it's filled with glaring plot holes characters who are ruled by stupidity bad acting and above all a poor script which has been done before in many many films only better i feel sorry for donald sutherland i just hope he had to do this film rather than wanted to miss it
<START> so <UNK> <UNK> earned like nine bucks and free food for this so that is a victory in and of itself br br more importantly this movie tells a very interesting tale about a group of salvage guys coming across the broken down i should warn you i'm <UNK> <UNK> around through this review real quick so <UNK> up first <UNK> first <UNK> plays a guy named likes drugs finds a bunch of <UNK> on board and now i don't know anything about the future but maybe they <UNK> drugs in <UNK> not <UNK> say that was the <UNK> thing in this movie later on the vampire gets out of his <UNK> filled coffin and then the real hilarity begins first although this movie has the word dracula in it he is actually not in this movie i have a theory though out of the blue you see the salvage <UNK> ship leave without them my theory is that dracula was on board with his retarded brother dracula told he'll be right back dracula got the hell out of this movie before he could be seen leaving to play the vampire for the six or so minutes he is in the movie the best part of this film and for those of you that have seen this you know what i'm <UNK> say is after gets <UNK> <UNK> whatever he has this huge monologue about <UNK> on various parts of erika body and other super cool stuff <UNK> seriously you are the best thing ever br br some other stuff happens in this movie too like casper van dean gets some work screams a lot and loses his arm and then we kinda lose track of him for the rest of the movie and thank god really we find out <UNK> character is a police <UNK> as the movie comes to a close we find out that the ship is on a course to ram into the sun the police <UNK> and one other surviving character are doomed rather then avoid certain death <UNK> police <UNK> reveals she's also a whore <UNK> and they decide to screw each other and die before they die in the sun they die for no reason yep that's right their ship blows up for no real reason br br this movie got the amazing rating for one reason <UNK> my god if they gave academy awards to black <UNK> then he'd be the first to get one the only reason this didn't get a perfect ten is because there was not a drop of nudity now i know what your thinking how can you judge a film by whether ladies show their goods or not well easy a movie like this pretty much requires it its part of the process gore gore monsters nudity gore end of movie final shock at the end its the formula this had some gore the monster was awesome because he sucked so hard he actually did us the favor of staying off camera that was <UNK> of him and i respect that nudity not a drop even though there was a length conversation about well see the above statement and as for the shock twist i certainly didn't see the end coming that counts br br i hope hollywood doesn't think <UNK> gave this film his all and has nothing left he deserves more work well until dracula <UNK> i'm out
<START> if you watch this movie you'll be <UNK> it and referring to it for a long time to come it's been years since i saw <UNK> and i still quote it to this day it's a true classic it is so mind numbingly awful that it makes a hilarious view every terrible line of dialogue is totally amazing every <UNK> shot a work of art and every punch and kick so woefully executed you won't believe your eyes it's all i can say if i really get into how mesmerizing this movie is i won't be able to stop and i'll go way over the imdb 1000 word limit br br please please watch this movie you'll be in <UNK> either 1 10 or 10 10 depending on your sense of humor
<START> if this is <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> of london then the producers must be on different planet br br it is the most depressing <UNK> dark <UNK> <UNK> on tv br br everyone is fighting everything has nasty under tones running through it nothing is done for genuine reasons br br if you want a real life picture of people in london or the uk then this programme is by the <UNK> from reality br br there is not one good word i can say about this programme the only <UNK> is that will be a great big fight over christmas dinner br br even the characters are totally unbelievable
<START> i saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends its reputation had <UNK> it and though all my friends were also of legal age i alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it we gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend though we sat in close <UNK> to each other we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence as it turned out the film both <UNK> and did not merit the <UNK> shame we felt it did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content but it disappointed in every other way br br <UNK> attempts to <UNK> genres by combining a historical epic with a <UNK> porn flick it fails miserably in its ambition <UNK> the audience to the worst of both worlds the film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real graphic sex but in setting this sex in the context of <UNK> <UNK> reign it <UNK> the act even less than the average adult movie sex without context might at least be physically <UNK> for the <UNK> adults involved but pleasure and perhaps even <UNK> are largely absent from the world of <UNK> in it sex at best serves as an <UNK> <UNK> and at worst as an <UNK> of sadistic <UNK> in the present day it is somewhat common to hear words like sin and <UNK> used to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives <UNK> takes the viewer beyond the <UNK> by depicting true <UNK> and <UNK> that no joy or pleasure comes from it br br the historical portions not only fail to <UNK> the sex they fail to entertain <UNK> intrigue or interest the viewer in any way they only provide lengthy stretches of <UNK> tedium rarely has a film proved so boring the sex after the initial shock and <UNK> fades only contributes to the overall <UNK> of the picture br br rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence while many films more violent than <UNK> have been made few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence <UNK> <UNK> as well as hyper <UNK> sexuality <UNK> <UNK> the violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex br br a review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it i understand why someone would want to see this film after all i myself <UNK> to the same curiosity i simply hope that my review by <UNK> describing its lack of redeeming value will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not my high school criminal justice teacher described police work as hours of boredom <UNK> by moments of sheer terror this statement perfectly describes <UNK> you have been warned
<START> not only that the vhs and dvd cover at least in europe show a scene that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie the acting is so bad that the movie is crying out for being made fun of if you have nothing to do you are with some good friends and you want to have some laughs about a movie that is supposed to be serious watch and peter <UNK> a man who will teach you how to knock over bad guys with empty <UNK> boxes shame on dennis hopper following example by starring in his very own battlefield earth for those who want to watch a good movie about the earth being destroyed by a terrible force please do not choose but do yourselves a favor and watch <UNK> for he 20th time
<START> carson <UNK> has to be the only late night talk show host that isn't a comedian what was nbc thinking he's not funny the writing is horrible to all of the sketches are painful to watch the current new <UNK> isn't funny at all especially since he tells you what they are going to sing before they sing it the <UNK> interviews is just stupid and needless to say not funny at all all he jokes especially during the monologue are the least clever dumbest not funny jokes ever put on television i mean anytime he makes a jessica simpson joke he ends it with because she's stupid which <UNK> out any that was in the joke which was already very low any 3 year old could have come up with any of the jokes and sketches they put on this lame excuse for a show seriously don't watch this show unless you're on the edge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge
<START> i couldn't agree more the book is one of dean best novels and this film is a total travesty i watched about half of it then threw the tape in the bin in disgust i have no idea what the idiotic director was thinking making this piece of crap but i would rather poke my eyes out with a sharp stick than watch this useless movie again everything about this film is just wrong first the main character is changed from an ex marine to a high school kid why second the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie <UNK> i bet <UNK> would have something to say about that lol the dog is cute enough and the best thing in the movie and completely <UNK> everyone else also a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the movie there really is nothing good to say about the film except that at least it's relatively short at an hour and a half or so if anyone hasn't seen the film yet do yourselves a favour read the book it is so much better than this worthless waste of time
<START> it is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see the english patient again after anthony death most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point the endless moral struggle of those who <UNK> walk a very thin line in the talented mr <UNK> moves away from patricia amoral tom <UNK> to give the murderer a conscience in breaking and entering gives jude <UNK> character the need to confess and the <UNK> are <UNK> moving here in the english patient the characters in love are never too far away from their <UNK> feeling of guilt ralph and <UNK> scott thomas are extraordinary they strip their characters from every <UNK> in a compelling <UNK> with us the audience juliette <UNK> is quite simply spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful andrews are filled with a sensual innocence anthony gave us films that were one way or another that <UNK> mix of art and <UNK> he was true to himself but thought about his audience he knew how to push our buttons without <UNK> his own there is something clear honest and startling about <UNK> i miss him already but i'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind
<START> all i can say about this film is to read the back of the video case and then put it back on he shelf and pick anything else i mean anything a blank video would be better than watching this
<START> even though this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes good <UNK> its plot was terrible its horror wasn't really that good its sci fi was even worse but its <UNK> were excellent <UNK> may was extremely beautiful too
<START> skip this hollywood version a real piece of garbage a cheap insult to the brilliant original <UNK> or by the english title also called the <UNK> it completely misses the mark in typical grotesque hollywood fashion usually due to a bunch of talentless corporate bean <UNK> who haven't the <UNK> idea about anything artistic they just look for the successful formula and want it applied to everything to <UNK> a profit much like the awful the scarlet letter made in 1995 which twisted the original story around so much to suit the crowd that it became an <UNK> not even a <UNK> but a pile of <UNK> that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original except that movie at least had gary <UNK> who is interesting to watch in anything he does this dog has nothing going for it even the usually very talented jeff bridges is an embarrassment great tragedy is not nor never should be the feel good movie of the year but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition br br do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a dutch french collaboration in 1988 that is a great film this is a horrific mess
<START> someone once defined what is the definition of an intellectual as being a person who can listen to the william tell <UNK> without thinking of the lone ranger in this we <UNK> <UNK> it surely would be a tall order to accomplish this and one that leopold <UNK> or leonard <UNK> would all find <UNK> well impossible to do br br and in this there is no disgrace the radio series and the television series along with some movie serials feature films <UNK> newspaper comic strip and comic books all did their part to make the masked man of the <UNK> and his faithful indian companion <UNK> a deeply <UNK> element of our collective psyche and of our literary <UNK> br br as with most legends it all started gradually first with a series of radio plays written for local use in detroit over radio station the creator was one george w and the principal writer on the series was mr brother in law mr <UNK> <UNK> the year was 1933 when the ranger first <UNK> out to <UNK> <UNK> of the early western united states the lone ranger <UNK> and the radio series all successfully guided depression era americans through the mid and late <UNK> up to and through world war ii but the post war era found the country in the midst of a super <UNK> explosion of invention and technology there had been a new <UNK> medium standing ready in the wings but unable to go forth until both <UNK> day and <UNK> day had been achieved once these were accomplished and the world and america was ready to settle down to both peace and <UNK> the new technology was of course was television and we would surely need something else than roller <UNK> and wrestling from <UNK> to fill up the broadcast hours and while at first the time that a tv station had anything on except that portrait of that <UNK> chief test pattern <UNK> very soon and with post <UNK> the networks began <UNK> their existing natural resources their existing programming virtually all would be <UNK> for adaptation to the tv screen br br so the folks over at lone ranger <UNK> were very interested when producers jack <UNK> harry <UNK> harris and jack all approached them with a deal to put the masked man and <UNK> on the television waves as well as the radio br br immediately they went to work and gave us the first season which made use of the considerable back <UNK> of radio dramas all potentially <UNK> to tv dramas they cast <UNK> moore a fine supporting actor in many a feature film and with about a dozen years experience he also had done some work in serials over at republic <UNK> thrill factory which would be <UNK> experience in doing the lone ranger cast as his faithful indian companion and partner in bringing justice to various parts of the frontier we had sheer perfection in character supporting actor jay we must mention that there was that <UNK> in about when <UNK> moore walked and was replaced with john hart after a season or so mr moore was back in having been missed so much now back to our story the first years of filming gave the episodes a look and a sound all of their own they made good use of off screen narrator which gave these shows a feel of authenticity and an individual stand out one of a kind series the actors employed were all veterans of the movies of the late silent era thru the 1930's and 1940's a lot of them had been just about exclusively cowboy movie players a good example of these is the casting of glenn strange bartender sam on <UNK> as the vicious murderous gang leader butch and it was the <UNK> massacre of the texas rangers that led to the origin of john reid thought to have been <UNK> with the other texas rangers as the lone ranger br br in addition to the old <UNK> in the cast you will find a lot of new and up and coming talent then in the cast we see people like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> denver <UNK> and others in the cast from week to week all of this along with an always calling for fair play justice and peace in a western world br br the last couple of seasons brought some big changes first was the use of colour filming that made no difference as a colour tv set was still a long way off for our household the second was a new set of musical themes and <UNK> other than finale from u no the new music was never a big deal to us as we preferred the old radio stock stuff br br with this series and two feature films done during this period the lone ranger warner brothers 1956 and the lone ranger and the lost city of gold united artists 1958 the character has been <UNK> and <UNK> impressed in our identity as a people we americans
<START> films <UNK> to the film noir genre usually contain similar elements a <UNK> ex <UNK> plot twist that drives the main character <UNK> into <UNK> a pretty but psychotic girl a handsome but psychotic thug lots of money lots of brutality and usually a denouement in the desert think high <UNK> or white heat br br there is plenty of hard boiled bad film noir out there but when film noir is good you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives br br it is this latter tradition that blind spot belongs to the film follows danny <UNK> a troubled teenager superbly played with depth grace emotional integrity and downright by james franco who throws himself completely into this role who has fallen in love with the rough edged <UNK> br br from the beginning you know this is going to be bad br br <UNK> invites danny to his house but the house is empty and for sale and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor danny is robbed of his clothing and <UNK> but uses the check to track down the <UNK> april other lover when they reach real home they find wayne a thug hunting <UNK> down for the money he's stolen together the three manage to locate <UNK> in a dusty run down motel in the desert but that's only the beginning of the tale as plastic <UNK> drugs gun running a creepy funeral home <UNK> <UNK> and a lonely half finished house in the desert bring events to an explosive head in an alley outside a <UNK> <UNK> in los angeles br br this film contains some of the best noir cinematography i have seen in years in one scene danny races on foot through the desert to the half finished house in the desert where he believes <UNK> may have been taken that evening by <UNK> a very long shot with sharp lighting effects shows danny arms and legs <UNK> <UNK> fear <UNK> on his face visible even at this distance dust cloud <UNK> behind him as the wind <UNK> in his direction racing across the desert <UNK> toward the house the loneliness the desperation the despair danny feels is shocking depicted there are many such scenes in this film wonderfully crafted by the experienced this is oscar winning material br br the editing too is just astounding the film contains little moments where the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation bits of time where memory and feeling come <UNK> back at these times quick montages of images flash across the screen this is superb editing by director writer editor <UNK> in one early montage danny describes the wondrous feelings he has now that <UNK> has entered his life quick images of <UNK> diary flash across the screen the words 4 life lucky and safe stop <UNK> while page upon page of words the <UNK> of a human heart race across the screen out of focus too quick to read it's like the <UNK> of emotion danny himself feels br br the <UNK> of images reveals something else about this film just how beautiful <UNK> <UNK> production design is <UNK> home is the perfect match of high tech and <UNK> a tribute to the of set <UNK> <UNK> foster the stunning desert house scene is just outright creepy the ruined motel where <UNK> hides out can be found in any abandoned small town in america the creepy and <UNK> lit funeral home where the plot takes a horrific turn mixes <UNK> with the <UNK> of death hanging over the entire film it's too bad the film's lighting director is not credited this film has a superb production design one that enhances every single frame and every actor's performance br br that's the fourth element of this film which makes it grab you and hold on to you the acting james franco is a superb actor even in spider man where he was given practically nothing to do franco showed that he understands human emotion like no other actor of his generation he's no pretty boy <UNK> on his good looks like brad pitt franco portrays deep emotion with full force his performances contain pure human heart consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home where danny <UNK> after telling april and wayne that <UNK> is dead lesser actors couldn't carry off the complete emotional breakdown of a human being franco does br br shawn <UNK> in her first film simply blows you away with her performance as the <UNK> april deeply in love with <UNK> suffering from massive depression after having to bury alone her unborn child after the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> box in the woods her life of luxury and perfection now a <UNK> april is one of the best drawn characters on film that i have ever seen while <UNK> relationship to <UNK> is slowly <UNK> out during the film <UNK> nervous breakdown is revealed only to the audience neither danny nor wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being <UNK> despair when she realizes danny has also been lover is poignant and potent even if it is <UNK> by the character's complete inability to feel any emotion for very long now <UNK> brings to april a pathos that puts your heart through the <UNK> br br mark patrick <UNK> is given the hardest job in the film having to make something human and real out of the thug wayne at first wayne is simply one of any number of violent foul mouthed obsessed drug <UNK> gun <UNK> that appears in any number of films from <UNK> cop to beverly hills cop 2 <UNK> does very well with what he's given but he doesn't quite get to where you feel much for wayne it's difficult to say whether this is <UNK> problem or the <UNK> there is one moment where wayne who is brother although neither danny nor april know this reads <UNK> diary and realizes the sexual and emotional link between the two men where you just know that wayne is going to go <UNK> on <UNK> ass but the explosion never comes thank god trite plots are death to film noir once the revelation about the siblings comes at the film's end the audience is fairly <UNK> to realize the depth of love and compassion wayne truly felt for <UNK> so deep that wayne accepted <UNK> homosexual love for his <UNK> brother but this all happens off screen <UNK> is never given a chance to act out wayne's feelings it must have been very frustrating for the performer br br the story is rather inventive although the <UNK> device seen at the end of the film is likely to remind viewers of <UNK> are forever yes james bond a traditional narrative voice over which proves franco is as great a voice talent as he is a physical actor provides terrific atmosphere although it does tend to flow over into <UNK> a few times toward the end of the film providing some unintentional laughter terrific locales play key visual roles in the film kudos to the location <UNK> for finding such astounding buildings the end of the film struck me as a bit rushed not pat but a little too firm for my film noir tastes br br now i've seen audiences either hate or love blind spot modern film audiences exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence often have little appreciation for the subtleties of film noir my suggestion is to take a small group of friends who don't see despair emotional collapse desperation or depression as laughable take them to a small theater where they can glory in the spectacle of the film's vision but where their viewing won't be ruined by a crowd of people who won't recognize good film noir get them some popcorn trust me they'll be so <UNK> they won't finish it get them a <UNK> and let them be overwhelmed go some place bright and <UNK> afterward to wash the <UNK> and out of your soul because this film is so good at making you feel you'll need that
<START> it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie i have to say it is really hard to make a good and or realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money also i think this is an <UNK> way trying to get a bad reputation on first the <UNK> look a lot like an <UNK> second you got a stick third using computers to control <UNK> via fly by wire when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was don't fly with <UNK> <UNK> like use <UNK> instead they have a direct connection of <UNK> and br br all i can say bad story horrible acting most of the actors worst film trick ever
<START> a film to <UNK> its viewers just criticism points at its <UNK> pace over used snap <UNK> and <UNK> lingering <UNK> between the protagonists <UNK> point to <UNK> mighty performance and <UNK> de <UNK> photography of <UNK> br br taken altogether this might suggest an indulgent <UNK> for the <UNK> of homosexual love at a time 1971 when it was becoming legal in fact visconti has succeeded in making a <UNK> more complex film than such a single issue vehicle he has <UNK> his ideas <UNK> and all into a <UNK> paced arc br br inside this does indeed sit the central performance of rather than a <UNK> johnny come lately gay he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in his <UNK> <UNK> around an increasingly <UNK> <UNK> after the boy is a straight metaphor for the <UNK> <UNK> for truth in the teeth of the <UNK> mob and it is <UNK> cut with such a flashback br br music is possibly a little over used although it is well <UNK> the italian <UNK> is a wearing <UNK> but thankfully the acting doesn't suffer too much 7 10
<START> super original really great movie james franco and <UNK> miller really do go so well together on screen i sure hope it comes out soon i first saw this movie at a screening because of my age and gender i was asked to stay for a talk we all got to comment on the movie and a lot of people didn't seem to like it i really loved it and i don't know why so many people didn't think it was that good go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself one thing that you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go into it not knowing anything about it i had not known anything when i went to the screening other than it was called it really is worth seeing
<START> hitting the ground running the film begins with three murders in a row no plot no characters no motivation the second murder happens off screen and that <UNK> severed head is actually used to quite <UNK> <UNK> the third victim to death this is a high point but the are obviously smart enough to lead with strength soon they're covering up <UNK> dialogue scenes with detective voice over and shooting endless snappy <UNK> in ugly wide shot by now this <UNK> <UNK> horror atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an insurance <UNK> vibe with the monumental and rather endearing <UNK> of the leads <UNK> things further in that direction cop <UNK> meat <UNK> guy <UNK> repeat <UNK> early with a memorable severed finger in the <UNK> gag only how the hell did the fingers get in the <UNK> and wasn't the blood <UNK> purpose to collect the <UNK> they severed when the gore stops making sense you know you're in trouble and without spoiling the big nonsensical twist ending just take my word for it the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep <UNK> tube <UNK> <UNK> the basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get on with your life
<START> harrowing series about life in oz an experimental prison where they try to <UNK> prisoners there's gay sex rape torture <UNK> killings <UNK> tons of male nudity all in your face and going full force br br it also is easily one of the best written dramas ever put on tv and almost all the actors are just great since this was on cable there were no <UNK> on what they could say or show there's plenty of racist comments flying in here but it's for all races in fact the white characters come off pretty badly especially the <UNK> and the black characters come off better the peace loving muslims the <UNK> don't have a strong role and there are no asian prisoners at all all the prisoners seem to be back and willing to kill anyone at a moments notice but you still find yourself <UNK> with some of them even the guards <UNK> and doctors at the prison have serious issues br br i <UNK> recommend this but rent it don't buy it i have the whole collection and to be totally honest i don't think i ever want to see it again it's incredible tv but so grim dark and depressing guess i gotta sell it all online br br i give it a 10
<START> the movie has an excellent screenplay the situation is credible the action has pace first class direction and acting especially the 3 leading actors but the others as well including the mobster who does not seem to be a professional actor br br i wish the movie the director and the actors success
<START> when patricia <UNK> is attacked after witnessing her <UNK> murder detective <UNK> the city for her killer <UNK> the murderer after an <UNK> <UNK> patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country for the case is closed or is it blood relatives is an overlooked masterpiece donald sutherland plays a cop and it's nice to see donald <UNK> in a small role as a child <UNK> the conclusion is pretty disturbing still blood relatives is more of a mystery than a horror film so fans of gore will be disappointed a must see for fans of old fashioned mystery movies 9 out of 10
<START> man is this lousy it doesn't deserve much in the way of comment so keeping it brief rebecca is a highly <UNK> police psychiatrist who falls for latin lover antonio <UNK> in a wine store he of the <UNK> and jail house when she cuts loose she really cuts loose other than this <UNK> affair she's having and we must admit the affair has its speed <UNK> she's a pretty cold fish her broke <UNK> father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out she's also <UNK> at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor dennis miller at bay and there's prisoner harry dean <UNK> who's trying to <UNK> her into giving him a <UNK> of multiple personality disorder so he won't have his <UNK> nailed to the wall for the serial murders he's committed br br all these people and perhaps more are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her somebody sends her dead flowers somebody does <UNK> things to her pet cat the next time i see a household pet turn up in a <UNK> or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot i'm going to <UNK> so who's doing it guess no power on earth could force me to reveal the ending but maybe a hint will help childhood abuse br br the abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself far more interesting than the movie what does childhood abuse mean do we mean sexual abuse physical both how about <UNK> a kid over the back with a wooden cooking <UNK> hard enough to break it that's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids just as similar things happened to all the other <UNK> boys in the neighborhood sexual abuse that never happened to any of us as far as i know although i'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation in the <UNK> village i studied for two years there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl the girl's family beat hell out of him the boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village an <UNK> that lasted two years by the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone including the child by the way the little girl we see here is under five so it's unlikely that she'd remember <UNK> night time visits in any case since long term memory isn't really established until about that time experience leading to her mental disorder can be called the social construction of trauma it's not there unless we put it there enough of the psychiatric lecture that will be fifteen cents br br you want trauma i'll give you trauma the film absolutely forces us to identify with rebecca character right from the beginning then when she has her first <UNK> with antonio <UNK> and <UNK> score is <UNK> the <UNK> into our heads the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare antonio <UNK> over us with his hairy chest now that's traumatic it makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the <UNK> room at the california men's colony in san luis don't get me wrong i don't dislike antonio <UNK> it's just that i'm not in love with him there aren't enough nude shots of rebecca body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety br br here's an engaging way of surviving this movie instead of just sitting there <UNK> try picking out the scenes that were filmed in toronto and <UNK> them from the ones shot in <UNK> it's a challenge really and may for all we know <UNK> your sanity
<START> if you've ever listened to any of the james lee burke books on tape or cd and the reader was will <UNK> you may agree with me that will is the <UNK> of dave r br br tommy lee jones is a native <UNK> or so i've heard and no one portrays a <UNK> better imho but he's not a <UNK> his delivery is all wrong i lived in the state for several years and i can still hear the strange <UNK> that a <UNK> accent contains doesn't have anything like that br br i thought marry was a good choice for but i missed seeing <UNK> who will be cast in this role the rock mickey rourke whoever he'll have to be big br br overall i thought the movie was only a 4 the plot <UNK> around like a fish out of water and didn't have the normal interesting yet non linear continuity that the book typically has br br hopefully hollywood will try another <UNK> book last car to fields would be a good choice we'd get to see some of the best villains from <UNK> ever
<START> like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick we <UNK> the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on leaving no dark haired ghost lady <UNK> we had good reason to do so the asian market had <UNK> such terrifying wonders as <UNK> dark waters the grudge and a tale of two sisters by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in 2003 the market seemed to be <UNK> up leaving it open for mockery and <UNK> despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead now don't get me wrong there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made the likes of and <UNK> to mention but two will stand as minor genre classics some day but the haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party and was time to take that success drunk tramp home to bed then along comes a film like the curse a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it's roots yet throws the out the window whilst doing it what i'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all the film is a documentary about one of <UNK> top <UNK> <UNK> as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door yet there is no baby there apart from a middle aged woman and her son these two disappear <UNK> when the reporter <UNK> his nose around but strange other <UNK> start popping up a psychic young girl a mentally ill <UNK> a pretty young actress who had a strange vision a lot of dead <UNK> and a very sinister demon by the name of leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town br br to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit the film is shot in fashion and <UNK> footage from tv shows and news reports and the <UNK> via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night the comparison ends there really br br what is refreshing about is how it doesn't <UNK> to modern horror audiences if you are expecting ghost ladies to pop out of the attic look elsewhere the film's strength lies in it's slow <UNK> build up of terror a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it the climax is pretty damned freaky but just when you think the film is over you get treated to the <UNK> ending when the credits start to roll and sweet holy f <UNK> is it a killer in terms of acting it is mostly convincing you get some <UNK> relief from the crazy tin foil covered <UNK> but that soon <UNK> up half way through the film the film also has a slightly feel than a lot of asian ghost horror as there is a violent streak to some of the events too br br overall is one to watch on your own late at night not since my first viewing of <UNK> ten years ago have i been so delightfully <UNK> out watching a horror film it is one that will <UNK> away at you until it is too late then it is under your skin just let yourself go to this one completely and not a haired ghost lady in sight no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan let alone had an american remake <UNK> up yet check this one out if you can essential viewing in my books
<START> roger corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic <UNK> in his <UNK> low budget career <UNK> over 300 movies while few if any would call him great his <UNK> obscure connections to underground culture via reference tribute or influence have <UNK> him a <UNK> legacy of sorts throughout his career he has also developed a bad habit of <UNK> his own films <UNK> <UNK> from the deep the black <UNK> etc without <UNK> on them in the slightest <UNK> written and directed by jay andrews jim <UNK> the man behind one of my favorite cinematic guilty pleasures <UNK> mall takes that practice to a disturbing new low regarding <UNK> mid <UNK> <UNK> trilogy br br credits are in quotes because <UNK> isn't a tribute to the <UNK> films and not even a remake <UNK> is the <UNK> films or at least the film's dinosaur induced death scenes <UNK> spliced together with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes many of which consist of <UNK> eye view shots in a lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious the new material was written around the footage instead of vice versa and is totally <UNK> with huge gaps of logic e g two separate teams are sent in by the military simply so footage from parts 2 and 3 where the soldiers had different uniforms could be included which is amazing considering how little logic plays into any of the <UNK> films already the actors' lack of any feeling in their characters though in fairness any character dimension is only presented in the script once maybe twice brings to mind the terribly wooden acting in 1950's b films and it certainly doesn't make anything between the ripped off attack scenes worth watching even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious <UNK> in the physical build between the new actor and the actor in the original scene when the only scene <UNK> any response in a film is the oldest trick in the horror book the spring loaded animal something is seriously wrong br br as it stands this is a despicable practice in two b grade figures who need not worry about ruining their <UNK> because they haven't got one ripping off their own material for the <UNK> and <UNK> of dirty tricks simply because they can why else would anyone feel possessed to rip off a series meant to be a rip off of the jurassic park series there isn't much more i can say other than that this film carries my very highest <UNK> against viewing the only good thing about it besides <UNK> at melissa <UNK> is that now i don't have to see any of the <UNK> movies
<START> <UNK> it's very interesting watching this half the people involved with it are now dead br br anyways it's been a long time since i've watched anything muppet related but this stuff is pure gold i'm a great fan of <UNK> and this movie has them quite well placed but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing it's not really high speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go br br <UNK> the frog is just an awesome character his voice and the expressions on his puppet face are fantastic but above all he points out why he's popular he can sing and make jokes too but more appropriately why he's so endearing he without any effort <UNK> everyone to search for their dreams in the meantime he also has to deal with himself which is an <UNK> theme in family movies br br it also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there some to great effect others to a little less i think mel <UNK> part was just a bit <UNK> do you some parts of the film are just kind of odd but it's highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction br br moving right along br br <UNK>
<START> this is quite possible the worst movie ever made i know people talk about how horrible ed wood movies were plan 9 but this movie makes plan 9 look amazing br br chuck norris makes a cameo for what reason i have no idea perhaps to ruin his movie career aside from chuck norris the movie's cast consists of extras in daytime <UNK> and mike norris that's right <UNK> son br br this director doesn't even have a resume and i have no idea where the plot or screenplay <UNK> this must've been green lit by a horrible southern <UNK> minister that somehow had a 3rd cousin that owned a studio which i'm sure has since been shut down br br i don't really know what else to say about this movie i would like to give you a plot summary but i'm lost there is something about jesus and satan some eternal battle other than that there are indians and a bunch of freaky kids that don't know how to act they're just awkward and should not be on camera i don't know what was going on most of the time but i know the movie was a great laugh mike norris pushes his daughter on her bike into the street somehow but in the shot he's in the middle of the park so somehow she learns to ride her bike with speed equivalent to that of the flash and gets hit by a car or bus i don't know but she's dead this is actually the funniest scene in the movie i know that sounds sick but once you see mike raise his hands in victory and then hold his head and scream in terror you'll understand it doesn't show the daughter getting hit or anything you just have to assume she got hit by some vehicle but the movie's not clear so maybe it was completely unrelated and she died from cancer anyway after that the movie gets really confusing and i have no idea what really happens i am a christian and i have no idea why this movie was made i don't see any value for this movie in a religious or non religious <UNK> this is probably the first thing they show students in film making 101 this is what you don't want to do br br just see it you'll hate it and me for suggesting that you see it
<START> i was blown away when i saw the best years of our lives the acting script and master william <UNK> direction winner of best director in 1946 is brilliant br br this film is about three wwii veterans who come home from the war and are reunited with their loved ones but have to deal with the <UNK> of coming home from the war br br the first man al <UNK> played by march in his oscar winning role comes home to find his wife <UNK> played by myrna loy and children peggy and rob played by <UNK> wright and michael hall are more grown up and different than before he left for the war br br the second man fred <UNK> played by dana andrews has to find a good job and come home to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war he begins to find out that she is not the same br br homer <UNK> played by harold russell in his oscar winning role has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family's and <UNK> played by cathy <UNK> reactions to the <UNK> he has instead of his hands br br all of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes the stories of these men are all <UNK> beautifully together br br this film truly <UNK> the meaning of a classic this unforgettable drama winner of best picture in 1946 is a film that everyone should see br br if i was asked to pick a favorite film this would be it br br out of 10 i would give the best years of our lives an 10 br br so next time you go to your local video store rent this movie you won't regret it br br no <UNK> material a good family film
<START> royal <UNK> 1988 bored me pretty damn good the <UNK> itself is pretty <UNK> filled with mid and a winner that really had no point in winning and why on earth did the young vs the <UNK> main event half the crowd left jessie <UNK> sounds bored through half the thing and you can tell when he mentions he finds the development of hogan vs andre more interesting <UNK> and <UNK> don't have the chemistry of gorilla and jessie br br ricky <UNK> vs ravishing rick rude heavily disappointing match with too many rest holds and too much of a <UNK> pace sink this one when it picks up like crazy in the last 5 minutes it's too little too late <UNK> wins by <UNK> br br 2 1 2 5 br br next is up <UNK> bravo attempting to set a new <UNK> press record with <UNK> <UNK> him horrendous segment with no entertainment value what so ever <UNK> is not nearly enough to carry this segment and even <UNK> admitted it was boring controversy or not i wasted enough time on this crap br br 0 5 br br <UNK> woman's tag team championship br br 2 out of 3 falls br br the <UNK> girls c w jimmy hart vs the jumping bomb angels this is the best match of the night no i'm not kidding very exciting stuff for woman's wrestling and you'll be hard pressed to find stuff this good now a days the jumping bomb angels were way over and the crowd went ape sh t for their title win br br 3 5 br br contract <UNK> between hulk hogan and andre the giant hogan gets a decent pop but there a few noticeable for him probably because its in canada a bit too drawn out for my liking but it was necessary for the storyline it got it's point across and had some effective moments but a lot of the times i kept saying get on with it both sign and andre <UNK> <UNK> head on the table and pushes the table on him br br 2 1 2 5 br br royal <UNK> match very weak royal <UNK> probably due to awkward pacing and the true lack of star power i think vince was testing the waters with this one and it showed <UNK> seems <UNK> and i don't blame him crowd clearly wanted roberts to win yelling <UNK> almost every 5 minutes he was in there and while <UNK> got a good pop i don't believe he was the winner they wanted and where did this take his career nowhere 1st ever royal <UNK> and he made an impressive showing it wasn't terrible but it was quite lackluster and it didn't have enough to make the show considering this was what the show was based on br br 2 1 2 5 br br hogan has an interview with craig standard interview but not with the same <UNK> and outrageous remarks he usually pulls br br 2 5 br br ted and andre get interviewed andre claims he will deliver the championship to mr <UNK> short but effective br br 3 5 br br 2 out of 3 falls br br the <UNK> vs the young crowd is completely dead for this and half of them <UNK> for the it's quite dull and had no business being in the main event jessie and vince seem bored and argue about other things while the match is taking place <UNK> win due to taking advantage of injury br br 2 5 br br bottom line historically important i suppose but there is really nothing to see here this was just a starting cue for great things to come for the royal <UNK> and while you can see glimpses of potential here there is nothing on here going out of your way to see i usually recommend everything once for die hard wrestling fans and considering it's the 1st royal <UNK> event i suppose i have too but prepare to be bored a lot of the time br br 3 10
<START> a long <UNK> concert release rush in <UNK> dvd is both compelling and disappointing this slick two disc set shows rush at their finest after 30 years of <UNK> their unique sound it's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever br br the concert features over two dozen songs a documentary and three songs that feature multi angle viewing <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and a small insert it's <UNK> very well for the amount of material it contains br br i'm a rush fan of the late seventies to early eighties period and this dvd comes through big with half of the show <UNK> songs from that era i won't list the songs in case you want to be surprised if you attended the <UNK> <UNK> tour then you'll know what they'll be playing br br playing in <UNK> to their biggest crowd ever rush is a huge crowd <UNK> here in fact that was one of the first things i noticed that was peculiar about this show throughout most of this two hour concert you hear and see the crowd <UNK> <UNK> and dancing wildly to the music at first it's <UNK> to see the fans give rush a well deserved response but after several songs i was ready to hear and see more of the band and less of the crowd this is in no way a slam of the crowd of <UNK> more power to them it's a critique of the final editing of the dvd br br which brings me to my second and main reason i hate it the video editing is terrible in my opinion save for the multi angle view bonus cuts the entire show is a frenzy of visual chaos it's like the director wanted to see how <UNK> he could make it i count changing camera angles on average between every one and four seconds constantly after about three or four songs my head and eyes were ready for a break which is too bad because i would have liked to have sat through the whole show like i was able to at the concert last year maybe this fast cut editing is the latest <UNK> for concert dvd's but i really think it's an annoyance and <UNK> from the overall experience as stated before i wouldn't mind it for a song or two but the whole visual aspect of this disc is <UNK> or rushed it's really ironic because all the previous concert clips i've seen of rush mainly from moving pictures are strictly straight filmed with little switching back and forth it's almost boring visually speaking this dvd has taken it to the other extreme i know a lot of <UNK> in the <UNK> rush fans will <UNK> disagree with my statements but that's just my impression of it br br the bottom line if you're a rush fan you'll buy this dvd regardless of my review or any other i still would have bought it after i had read my review just don't get expect a normal concert who knows the things mentioned above might not bother you
<START> <UNK> has again tried to <UNK> bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about the story line is ok cinematography is outstanding screenplay and acting are way below average i guess the blame is to the citizens of in india from where her original set was destroyed in 2000 this resulted in a totally different cast i just wonder what a spectacular movie it would have been if it had the original <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> khan the current actors lisa ray who's just good for <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and john abraham are pathetic need basic lessons in acting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and have saved the movie as much as they can the kid had done an outstanding job the editing and the flow of the movie is also not something you would have expected from <UNK> great subject sends out a strong message about a practice which is still pretty rampant in rural india but falls short of the standards <UNK> set for herself in fire and earth watch it once when its on dvd don't bother paying 10 to see it well its out beats the average hindi movie any day
<START> this is an outstanding criminal thriller and with a great cast too spanish language <UNK> best and most popular actors of the past couple of decades victoria <UNK> and <UNK> team up in one of the better spanish language crime thrillers of 2004 5 br br the film begins by focusing on thirty something <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an elegant attractive and slick thief who learned from childhood friend and more recently from <UNK> an old seasoned <UNK> <UNK> introduces <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> an also elegant but more <UNK> experienced <UNK> thief the best in his class br br only known weakness is <UNK> victoria <UNK> his former mistress and partner she suddenly appears and <UNK> a fabulous rip off scheme to her former lover a crime in grand scale which will eventually require the help of <UNK> <UNK> and among others br br the script is full of twists and surprising <UNK> particularly towards the end of the film one criticism about the film i've heard a lot is that there are too many plot twists towards the end but i disagree the film <UNK> the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow in fact these are what make the film outstanding i highly recommend it
<START> not only does this movie have a great title but quite simply is the greatest drama i have ever watched the viewer is drawn into the movie involving 5 young men working together to try and overcome odds sean <UNK> as billy <UNK> is brilliant along with great supporting roles from t e russell <UNK> <UNK> and shawn <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of and characters makes the movie so much better as time goes on the movie keeps gathering momentum and its a <UNK> that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie
<START> ok it's easy not to confuse this with the lame stuart gordon movie called death bed that came out a few years back because this one is the bed that eats and how do i even begin to describe this well for starters obviously there is a bed that eats this is as a result of demon which of course affect most things i guess in a negative way the bed is in some old <UNK> quarters or something and has been responsible for the <UNK> of quite a few people in its time we have a narrator who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting and <UNK> all the non <UNK> <UNK> jewelry etc that the bed passes on he died of <UNK> one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten probably because he was sick he as we see him <UNK> blood into <UNK> <UNK> the thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty deadpan the movie is divided into several acts i guess breakfast lunch dinner just <UNK> for fans of the <UNK> weird and bizarre well this may just be right up your alley all i can say is you have to see this one to believe it it pretty well defies description 8 out of 10 stars
<START> this movie features some of the best ensemble work i've seen in film or on stage the actors play off each other with a skill and that in no way can be achieved through editing br br love jones a good story period but it is also an excellent portrayal of the urban middle <UNK> twenty something african american set that is not often seen
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had an unconvincing plot the screenplay required too much in suspension of disbelief the plot went at a <UNK> pace it started off in an interesting setting but soon <UNK> onto the <UNK> of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence what were the critics thinking this one is overrated even to be described as a loser even catherine who <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> and belle <UNK> <UNK> managed to be simply annoying br br we rented this movie at the same time as we rented another film we watched this one first and found it to be so bad that we sent the other one back unseen at the same time
<START> can't get much <UNK> than this deep dark film had my heart <UNK> throughout the lighting is dark and will get you in the mood for a death <UNK> experience literally <UNK> is in top form as he is today in 24 he's a great actor and he plays a very convincing and shocking role you won't forget for years to come and what can you say for the rest of the cast an all star <UNK> julia is <UNK> than ever will oliver and kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you gripping your seats it's a refreshing sight to see a true thriller with top notch professional actors you won't regret seeing this 2 hour seat <UNK>
<START> br br <UNK> <UNK> takes the wonderful play <UNK> and makes it into an engaging movie br br the war at home has an exceptionally strong cast all seemingly digging deep into their characters the acting here is top notch br br credit must also go to director <UNK> <UNK> the visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth the sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension br br remove all of the <UNK> <UNK> elements from the story and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics a viewer might see this point more clearly by keeping in mind the discovering the old photo scene from the beginning as the rest of the movie is watched br br as a movie i found the war at home to be more direct and to the point than born on the 4th of july a fine effort almost a 10 br br
<START> well first of all it's not a bad movie it is good and i like the characters introduced i also like lady and voices more in this br br however i would like to see lady and tramp more i know it says <UNK> and i love <UNK> and angel to bits but it's a sequel to the original where in my opinion they should of just released it as <UNK> not <UNK> and the tramp ii <UNK> br br tramp did have quite a role but he didn't have much time with lady br br but anyway the songs are quite good and <UNK> and angel are sweet i've seen better sequels but hey it's not a failure br br i give it 7 10 very good but still had flaws
<START> we thought this was one of the worst movies ever i had to <UNK> to watch the end the romance was not believable the characters were not developed the love affair made hardly any sense it was miscast and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either my opinion like the adams family goes on vacation just creepy gypsy and cheesy and the does not look typically like those houses on the surf and who would spend the night in one during a <UNK> if it was not theirs also it was not realistic give you plenty of notice to down the <UNK> br br also the friend was superfluous and did not match the story what did the civil war have to do with the anyway i also have to mention the wardrobe did d lane have to have a <UNK> <UNK> on in every scene it was overdone she looked good enough to not have to hide things without making them obvious like with light <UNK> br br lastly i am concerned with the impact on our <UNK> when everyone has to <UNK> of this stupid and i mean stupid movie don't fall for the hype on this one we did not even watchable
<START> this is one of the best and vampire tales ever i love this movie really the character are great even the locations and the story indeed the picture isn't a big budget production but it is absolutely worth seeing br br ok there are some faults especially the names of the castle and the locations in this movie but such mistakes are typically and are almost in every horror movie br br the scenery fits perfect to the story and is close to reality i can say that honest because i visit them once when i was in romania in my <UNK> br br in my opinion this is the best part of the <UNK> series
<START> very typical <UNK> of the time and in its own way no less funny than many of his later works and why is that there is nothing to be <UNK> or shocked about and i guess any such effect is more <UNK> than intentional no the great humor <UNK> from an underlying almost surreal absurdity that is woven into the scenery the characters' nearly complete lack of taboo it's the same kind of <UNK> <UNK> you find in his later works though you'll find it in a more rough version here he's building up for masterpieces to come but is not yet there br br the sole reviewer who commented on this movie before i did claimed that it had to be a very <UNK> group of people who'd find this movie hilarious i do
<START> i am a fan of slasher movies especially of scream 1 3 but this one is just one killing after another to my <UNK> part ii is far better and you get the whole story of part one <UNK> so don't waste time on this one and move right on to part ii you won't regret it cause part 2 actually has a plot and is quite self <UNK> first part 1 out of 10 second part 4 out of 10
<START> this show is pathetic i can't even begin to imagine how anyone with an iq greater than that of a can of split <UNK> soup that's past its <UNK> date can willingly sit through this garbage for an entire half hour it is one of those rare shows that is so mind numbingly awful in every respect you can honestly say you are less intelligent simply from watching it i <UNK> a study and found that the average person loses 10 iq points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show that is second only to another comedy network abortion 19 <UNK> iq points per second lost and pretty much a tie with girls will be girls keys to the <UNK> owes each and every one of us an <UNK> whenever i watch this travesty of a show i feel sad for society how is it allowed to continue
<START> i remember seeing this film when i was about 10 one of my friends had it at the time it was just a film as i was about and just thought of it as another action film br br when i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb albeit i haven't seen any and don't really remember him too much br br anyway just to say that this film is really bad in all ways it could be i would love to see it again though <UNK>

<START> with all the hype surrounding the stars of the movie this movie left me wanting i expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of murphy de niro and russo but found that the movie fell flat on it's face comedy sequences were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially de niro and russo couldn't save this one br br out of
<START> i remember a time when the only thing that did exist where <UNK> drugs <UNK> and parties this movie came out a couple of years after i started going <UNK> if i had never discovered the side of things this movie may not have made sense to me that night when i watched it for the 1st time with some mates i was completely blown away i had never watched a movie that hit so close to the reality of where i was in my life at that time almost everything i could relate to in some way there was never 1 character i could fully relate to but more a combination of all of them in one way or another my mates where no different and i remember us all saying that they where us or we where them we had all been out that weekend together doing exactly what the crew do in <UNK> we where coming down while we watched and when the movie came down i remember actually coming down a bit further it was actually quite depressing in our room during those low points thats what's so good about human traffic it really <UNK> the whole situation br br its a unique movie in the way its not plot driven but then its not completely character driven although the characters are important it always seemed to be based on the situations situations as a group and as individuals each character is lost in life for their own reasons yet each of them responds to the in the same way work any job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape it all for them its their holiday but the reality is you cant truly escape another situation they all have to face br br me and my mates where no different from these guys we all had our own stuff going on human traffic helped explain to us what we didn't understand about our <UNK> it does it in a way that doesn't talk down to you it made us feel like we weren't the only ones out there like us and that the lessons learned where ones many others from all over the world had gone thru it wasn't until my lifestyle changed from party to career driven that i would fully understand this movie these days i watch <UNK> every now and then as i just have and <UNK> the old days no other movie can do this i was peter i was <UNK> travolta i went to never never land with my chosen family i'd have 200 in my back <UNK> and i wax the lot no <UNK>
<START> this short film and the poem which is behind it is one of the greatest <UNK> i've ever seen br br the poem is beautiful it describes exactly the feeling of a person that chases a dream and can't realize <UNK> but it also tells how to <UNK> it i see the story of the cat and the moon as one beautiful metaphor to the human relationships passion and love br br technically it's done a good work too in spite of being very simple the animation in black and white gives a tone of allegory to the movie and to its message but also of <UNK> and nostalgia br br in addiction the music also contributes to this poetic feeling br br nothing else matters i will wait she will come when she can or when she wants to
<START> the <UNK> is an <UNK> dull and overly child friendly 80's cheese parade directed by kevin <UNK> creator of the much better films <UNK> and night of the demons and starring the incredibly <UNK> patrick <UNK> supposedly depicting a guy with feelings the pacing is really slow the plot feels far too familiar the monster effects are all but <UNK> and the film opens and ends with tedious narrative <UNK> that somehow feels unrelated to the actual subject matter of the film the voice over keeps on <UNK> about wind and creatures riding on wind but what the hell there's no wind in the plot like so many 80's horror movies the <UNK> handles about cursed indian landscapes and all too real mythical monsters hidden in <UNK> and <UNK> and his family move into a house build on what once was the home of native americans but then white people came and turned the land into oil fields half of the script is wasted on explaining the origin of the monster but i can easily <UNK> it for you an ancient indian <UNK> <UNK> the creature which looks like an over sized paper <UNK> rat to <UNK> the white people <UNK> his land but he buried it again because and i quote the <UNK> kills indians as well hugely irritating son accidentally <UNK> the beast and naturally can't convince his parents about the big hungry rat in the <UNK> the allegedly emotional family situation daddy constantly wants his son to love him is very pathetic and redundant and the film badly needed more bloodshed kids' movie or not the youthful hero chris miller is quite annoying but we've definitely seen worse kid actors in the 80's the <UNK> is very much not recommended unless of course you're a fan of cheesy and typically 80's monster designs the big dodgy rat thing is a real hoot to see
<START> i watched this film on <UNK> and i enjoyed it a lot it was very watchable and very funny julie <UNK> and rupert were perfect in their roles julie <UNK> gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch ben's character is kinda shy and stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by rupert i would definitely say he has a future in acting after harry potter br br laura <UNK> is quite good in her role as ben's over protective mother the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too villain y ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother and in the end he is quite <UNK> too the only character i wasn't keen on was she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought br br overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch one of my favourite films of the year easily
<START> i cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low this was one of the most beautiful films i have seen this year it really struck a <UNK> with me i had been <UNK> this film for several months and i thought to myself there's no way it can possibly live up to the expectations i had for it seeing as how i built it up in my head as much as i did well needless to say not only did it meet my expectations but it far <UNK> them <UNK> <UNK> and cameron diaz were excellent in every way their acting superb by far they were both in their element and completely natural for the roles the locales were absolutely gorgeous every shot filmed was perfectly captured and fit the mood and atmosphere beautifully i found this film very touching and took it very close to heart i would even contemplate saying this could be one of my all time favorites at the very least certainly i could see it again and again br br i swear i couldn't find one fault in this film it's hard to say that about any film i would highly recommend this one it's touching it's meaningful and it says a lot about human nature and family br br 10 out of 10 well done by all
<START> through the years i've been very much interested in the life of this teenager who left such a profound <UNK> mark on the world my fascination has also been born of fear as in could this happen again br br and throughout the ensuing years yes i fear <UNK> continues to happen around us and of course <UNK> was happening long before anne the <UNK> of course is can a so called <UNK> society turn on its own or on an innocent country race continent and murder citizens in cold blood on the <UNK> of excuses i leave that question out there br br at the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader <UNK> hitler in that the one profound fact about hitler that is never mentioned was that he was elected <UNK> and all of the atrocities committed were done as the result of a <UNK> <UNK> press and fear <UNK> propaganda played over and over again for a <UNK> population br br one of the atrocities was anne frank who put a face to the death camps by the miracle of her survival br br kenneth <UNK> does a wonderful job on the commentary and <UNK> he has that rare gift of <UNK> his own persona thus allowing the subjects to speak for themselves br br many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in the <UNK> research which i will not go into here as they add <UNK> to the reality and gut wrenching sorrow of the film br br glenn close reads <UNK> from the diary and her voice is perfect for the part she brings a <UNK> and <UNK> to the role br br old childhood friends of <UNK> are interviewed at length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personality br br this is not to be missed a wonderful and <UNK> film about the seldom seen anne br br 10 out of 10
<START> this movie has an outstanding acting by and a stunning by the <UNK> hector this is in my opinion the best brazilian movie ever made the movie was filmed with child from the the brazilian the children weren't actors and were casted by in the city of <UNK> de <UNK> the story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the <UNK> prison that looks much worse than <UNK> the children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman unfortunately this is not purely fiction in brazil it does happen till today a must see for those who like violent movies but take your mother off the room because it is a hard movie
<START> about 5 minutes into the movie you're thrown into this brutally tepid cat and mouse romance between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there the biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are this is what 50 year old producers and out of touch hollywood script writers think <UNK> life is like as if they gave the cast of friends some pot bland dull annoying and completely unrealistic i despise this movie
<START> while studying the differences between religion and cult in college <UNK> rachel <UNK> who is the best student in the class convinces her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> glenn <UNK> alex joel and morgan victoria to research the massacre of <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> by their leader owen robert twenty years ago in california had found an ancient <UNK> in southern china that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls but one woman <UNK> and he is destroyed however after the death of morgan who apparently committed suicide the students discover that has returned and is chasing their souls with his <UNK> br br the storyline of <UNK> is not totally bad unfortunately the screenplay the direction the acting the lines the camera the cgi and the edition are awful i was completely bored and tempted to use the <UNK> button of the dvd but i <UNK> and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never ending crap on a saturday night my vote is two br br title brazil o the secret charm
<START> an intense dark action drama with unusually rich support from <UNK> keith et al many of whom get the best roles of their careers and run with it the film is oddly shaped often the action slows down just to let the characters get caught up in odd but well done seemingly improved dialogues during the almost all of the machine get caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues and reynolds the director deserves <UNK> credit for having reynolds the star step back and give them room and unlike most action films you really get to like the characters which makes the 2nd half when their various <UNK> good and bad unfold unusually affecting the combination of character development brutal violence a <UNK> soundtrack tarantino must be a fan watch this then jackie brown and you'll see what i'm talking about make this occasionally flawed film the bad guys are a bit melodramatic one of the better modern cop films and in my mind superior to many of the overrated modern <UNK> such as body heat such
<START> this horror movie is definitely one of the best ones i have seen in my life and there are many reasons why the storyline is really good it has lots of action and great horror sequences in it the actors are not very good but there are not that bad but kane is definitely the best actor in this but he was always a good actor also the cast is very good such as kane as <UNK> <UNK> christina <UNK> as christine michael j <UNK> as samantha noble as <UNK> etc also i just have to warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing but they are very creative but that just makes it better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore also they look very realistic so i am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a really good movie so make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great br br overall score out of br br out of
<START> this series and gold were being hyped as the next big thing in sitcoms for nbc well they weren't dennis <UNK> was terribly miscast as the father in law he just seemed so uncomfortable and out of place here the term private time was supposed to become the <UNK> <UNK> catch phrase of the 21st century well it wasn't people were asking then as they still are today when his name comes up who the hell is gold i saw him on an episode of the <UNK> this evening i mentioned his name and my girlfriend asked who not funny total waste of <UNK> nbc had really high hopes for this show but it just fell flat
<START> thank god this has not been <UNK> by <UNK> br br this series while popular god knows why has a very simple <UNK> i've found another body behind the flowers <UNK> trees wherever they are working for the <UNK> time this <UNK> plot the dialogue is so simple it's as though this has been written for children talking down to the viewer and explaining every plot point br br they just to be around when someone does something out the ordinary and no one notices them br br every time they look into and investigate someone's murder they get in the way of everyone else messing up the lives of all including those completely innocent br br they break and enter into people's homes stealing items and evidence even <UNK> being <UNK> and getting into people's lives <UNK> on them and going through their stuff they never <UNK> never get caught or arrested and if they do they can talk their way out of it even though another character who does the same gets put in prison br br they always come up <UNK> now i know that this is an easy going series but i think that realistically this should not have made it past the first few episodes put simply it's unrealistic br br i think that they have found enough bodies in the both here and on the continent where they are every other week so i do hope it never comes back br br <UNK> should get some action on the screen instead of all the years of <UNK> been murdered at the village fair <UNK> type series
<START> a <UNK> young man returns west after being <UNK> in the hotel business via boston he quickly learns his friends in spanish <UNK> old california expect him to fill his deceased father's shoes instead that of a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after robbing them colorful but silly m g m production has a great deal of talent before and behind the camera but it never takes off this might have been fun second string material for <UNK> <UNK> but frank sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead combination of <UNK> comedy and musical <UNK> are <UNK> by the poor staging sinatra is photographed singing at one point in a mirror but one doesn't concentrate on his performance so much as <UNK> how odd the star appears reflected in this way kathryn grayson is the <UNK> daughter who falls for frank and her high soprano <UNK> turns her singing scenes into self parody aside from robert <UNK> cinematography and the decent art direction this <UNK> remains from
<START> i can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on imdb of course i've come to conclude that imdb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99 of films are rated from 6 to 7 it's the conclusion and failure of crowd on the internet for this purpose an average is taken of most people and unfortunately most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons but i <UNK> the movie i really don't want to waste my time writing about it let's just say i found it to be <UNK> made for seemingly two groups of people young teens at the age where violent action movies of any sort just hit the spot and <UNK> types that just love to choke down whatever gothic vampire fantasy they can get their hands on if you aren't in one of those categories you will find this movie absurd i did enjoy the first underworld it was fresh at the time and held a sort of edgy quality the second was a bit trying in plot but i did enjoy the direction and cinematography at times but this whole movie felt like a sci fi channel production or even a tv series i found the actors to be over directed their body language <UNK> into un natural idealistic poses that seemed contrived lines were spit out like young actors would spit out lines of shakespeare <UNK> in their own <UNK> glory at being in such a role but in doing so <UNK> <UNK> the role the plot was dry and predictable right from the start i found myself wishing things to just move along as it was so easy to tell what was going to happen i tried to care at first but my brain was forced to shut off by the end climax i actually caught myself falling asleep there were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make sense that it's not even worth listing them all if you're a <UNK> faced teen or a <UNK> <UNK> sure have at it for the rest of us forget it like i'm about to do right now
<START> potential viewers be warned the current imdb viewer rating for tomorrow at seven is an <UNK> of low <UNK> <UNK> it has an interesting premise a killer leaves an ace of <UNK> calling card at the scene of his crimes while <UNK> the victim in advance the execution falls flat however and to say that the movie has it's share of plot holes would be to imply that there actually is a plot br br <UNK> morris portrays mystery writer neil <UNK> <UNK> elements of actual murders by the ace of <UNK> killer into his latest novel <UNK> <UNK> to interview a wealthy businessman for his book but first he has to get past the man's eccentric secretary if you line his relatives up you'd have enough nuts to hold a ford together that line <UNK> him to the daughter martha <UNK> <UNK> who offers to make the <UNK> br br <UNK> meets <UNK> drake henry <UNK> just as the latter is about to complete a jigsaw puzzle delivered by a <UNK> that morning the only remaining pieces as we learn in the following scene form the bold black shape of the ace of <UNK> containing the words at seven tomorrow night now what person putting together a puzzle doesn't use the pieces with <UNK> colors first br br initially i was intrigued by the appearance of frank <UNK> and allen <UNK> in their roles as a pair of police detectives <UNK> to the drake <UNK> generally their characters are colorful enough to offer genuine comic relief but here they're just plain annoying <UNK> <UNK> in particular winds up shouting <UNK> to inane comments made by his partner <UNK> and both usually head in the opposite direction when real trouble might turn up br br now here's a question in light of the identity of the ace killer why would he have invited a novelist and a pair of cops that he just met on a flight to his <UNK> plantation especially when at seven <UNK> all parties would be a captive audience aboard the plane when the first murder is committed it's not drake however who's dead but his secretary austin winters grant mitchell the early suspicion falls on pilot henderson <UNK> <UNK> following a lights out scene but henderson still hasn't reported the murder to his <UNK> until well after he arrives at <UNK> plantation with everyone else can you imagine anyone trying to get away with that today unless your name was ted kennedy br br with the cause of death yet to be determined the local <UNK> is called in but the first one that shows up a <UNK> <UNK> is a phony yet when the real <UNK> shows up he simply disappears immediately after in a second dark out scene a letter from the murder victim austin winters is about to be read it winds up missing when the lights return and because it may point to the murderer it becomes a clue that must be <UNK> so where was the letter <UNK> daughter martha grabbed it and placed in on the <UNK> of the living room how much thought was put into this br br obviously the entire affair is so inane that <UNK> character <UNK> the case rather easily even though the film comes in at just about an hour it becomes almost a chore to watch with all the nonsense going on there's really only one humorous moment worth repeating while aboard the plane the detectives have this exchange <UNK> hey <UNK> how often do these things fall <UNK> once br br except for <UNK> and <UNK> i can't say i've seen any of the other players in films of the era though i'm a fan of most b grade mystery movies from the <UNK> through the <UNK> fortunately the pair <UNK> much better backing up <UNK> bogart in a goofy 1938 gem swing your lady where the laughs are intentional the best i can offer about tomorrow at seven is a quote from martha winters about <UNK> though this turkey this is just a silly waste of time
<START> review is of the original 1950's version not the restored 1980's one in a land where the king likes no one and no one likes the king a <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> from two nearby paintings come to life and run off a portrait of the king who loves the <UNK> kills the real king and takes his place a huge bird the of the title acts as a hero of sorts and helps out our two lovers br br this is a strange strange movie no surreal very very very surreal br br the style of the background is very european while the characters are meet warner but early arty warner of the non major characters they move in both realistic and cartoon like manners br br this is an odd movie and it takes a bit to get into it but peter ustinov as the bird is a riot his kids and the puppy are wonderful there are cops in rubber <UNK> and a bear design that makes you smile br br and there is deep philosophy in the film about the existence of a world out there out beyond a metropolis <UNK> city br br this is a really neat movie there is something just so odd and unique about it that <UNK> you if you stay with it for the whole ride its not perfect but what the hell br br this is a movie to search out if your local bargain dvd bin has the version paired with alice in paris buy it it should run you under ten bucks probably around five and the price is absolutely worth it especially when you realize it comes with two full length cartoons two short cartoons and several neat commercials and other fun things
<START> vhs i have watched this over and over and loved every minute of it so much so i have now ordered the dvd i only wished the film could have lasted longer i never worry about what other people think i prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever make up your own mind and don't let others put you off i have all jane <UNK> bbc series but this is my favourite i see there is to be a new <UNK> <UNK> released in 2007 which i will buy when it comes out but it will not stop me watching <UNK> <UNK> released in the 80's
<START> firstly let me make it clear that i love aircraft and usually any film with them in is worth watching and i've sat through some shocking ones however the same is not true of this film james stewart is an excellent actor but he is wasted in this <UNK> air command <UNK> film the acting is mediocre and the direction is weak i had to stop watching this awful rubbish about half way through this was despite some really good maybe even the best <UNK> photography the trouble is even for an <UNK> nut like me making something out of the shocking aircraft featured b <UNK> and b <UNK> just <UNK> on the nerves too much it's a shame that the film wasn't made when the b <UNK> appeared then the <UNK> used for the aircraft in this film would have been valid then i might have been able to sit through it perhaps i'm missing the point of the film which may be the angst suffered by loved ones while their beloved are on active duties in any case it could have been done much better recommendation well worth missing
<START> during the brief golden age of the super 8 <UNK> sound home movies we purchased a <UNK> for 00 on close out at a downtown chicago camera store it seemed that was getting out of the camera <UNK> business although they would continue with their other <UNK> such as the former <UNK> master 3 dimensional color slide viewers br br little did we know nor <UNK> the rapid approach of the video camera the <UNK> the vhs and the eventual dvd <UNK> with the super 8 <UNK> sound camera that we also purchased we took some sound film records as our daughter first holy <UNK> and her younger sister <UNK> <UNK> from pre school this was all circa 1979 <UNK> br br during this time we also purchased a few daddy toys to go with it like some super 8 <UNK> sound laurel hardy films and w c <UNK> shorts from <UNK> films <UNK> <UNK> we also picked up a columbia pictures home movies sound film of a then sort of forgotten classic cartoon <UNK> united productions of america columbia 1951 it was the hit of our home movies time br br being members of that baby <UNK> generation the wife deanna and <UNK> had <UNK> of the character of <UNK> for <UNK> had a network tv show on cbs early sunday <UNK> <UNK> 1955 bill <UNK> was the <UNK> host but we had never seen this original <UNK> theatrical cartoon nor was it known to us that the young master was a creation of dr seuss of grinch <UNK> and street fame br br the staff assembled was very talent rich and deep the outstanding production values are apparent director robert cannon and director john <UNK> were veterans at the top of their craft writers were theodore <UNK> dr seuss himself phil <UNK> and bill scott br br mr scott is remembered not so much for his writing <UNK> to <UNK> but for being partners with jay ward in such television <UNK> as rocky <UNK> mr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> george of the jungle hooper and <UNK> <UNK> with the jay ward productions he was a writer voice man and <UNK> general of the whole company br br the cartoon receives its only voice from the narrator radio movie tv actor marvin miller remember him he was michael anthony on the tv the millionaire don productions cbs television network 1955 60 br br bold color <UNK> and imaginative design went into giving the <UNK> animations a special feelings of loneliness fear <UNK> and eventual triumph and we might add the animation is definitely of the limited variety br br as with so many great stories <UNK> starts out with a simple premise one's being born different in this case it is young boy <UNK> who has been born to make sound effects in <UNK> rather than talking kids can be cruel and soon he is dubbed with his not so <UNK> nick name by a group of youthful <UNK> your <UNK> not it's <UNK> the noise making boy at this point the animation team does an outstanding job in shifting the emotional <UNK> in the young <UNK> from happy <UNK> to isolated lonely and finally to depression despair in not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding not even to his mother and father br br a <UNK> fashioned dark scene involving a highly <UNK> stylized run away scene involving a train and an equally stylized brings <UNK> right to the brink of absolute despair but then he is interrupted by a gentleman <UNK> that young <UNK> is wanted by the producer of some radio program to provide the sounds for the show down at the studio br br once the premiere show is done with <UNK> starring in the sound department he rides off in a huge <UNK> which seems to have anticipated those s t r e t c h <UNK> of our day to the cheers and admiration of his classmates and the world br br it has been said that there are only so many plots and in that case this story is most likely a variation on the ugly <UNK> for after all a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness br br note united productions of america or <UNK> for short was an outstanding center of creativity in the field of the animated cartoon they were responsible not only for <UNK> and several sequels and a tv series but also the highly popular mr <UNK> theatrical cartoons and subsequent tv show with voice talent of jim <UNK> the classic original tv cartoon of <UNK> the snowman and the rather bizarre dick tracy cartoon show with <UNK> voice rendered by mr everett sloane
<START> as others that have commented around the web i'm a <UNK> pilot in the coast guard having said that and being the <UNK> i am i went expecting the over the top cheese factors there was some cheese but all in all not much and the film was pretty accurate br br i watched the trailer again today after seeing the film yesterday i've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes this isn't the case br br the movie is truly more character story driven than action the inner struggles both <UNK> and <UNK> are dealing with is revealed further into than movie than <UNK> is br br of course there is a minor love story no surprise there but for the most part the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together and after some time help each other <UNK> old wounds br br as <UNK> as it sounds <UNK> and as much as i try not to like him <UNK> do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie br br as critics have stated you've seen it all before top gun officer and a gentlemen etc but what movie hasn't been remade a million times br br i can recall only one f word being spoken and can't really recall any other language br br the movie is 2 hours and for some may tend to get a little long towards the end br br you'll laugh you may cry but i can honestly say it was worth the 4 i paid br br i hope you enjoy the movie
<START> i could not believe the original rating i found when i looked up this film 9 5 unfortunately it looks like i am not alone br br the film is slow and boring really one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so high br br unfortunately this was not the case so when watching the film and seeing the poor story and acting i am left giving it a 3 10 score br br <UNK> jones is superb in lock stock and also snatch and he plays a great hard man however he should stick to this role its a bit like when stallone and <UNK> have done comedy films they just don't work br br neither can he play lead actor he plays better as supporting or otherwise when he plays lead his acting talents are too <UNK> <UNK> and shown up as not really very good mean machine is another good example of this
<START> be warned the next time you see richard kelly involved in any production run away fast br br kelly proved to the world after his last movie tales that he is one pretentious director it was indulgent and convoluted in the box not much has changed br br i can picture what his pitch to warner bros must have been and i bet the executives at the studio ate it right up a full feature film based on one of richard twilight zone <UNK> old short stories br br big mistake do not read any further unless you want this movie completely spoiled for you br br norma cameron diaz pushes the button br br turns out that <UNK> <UNK> frank <UNK> has an alien using his body as a <UNK> to conduct experiments in which the fate of mankind rests his face is <UNK> because he was struck by alien <UNK> which killed him but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing obviously since norma pushes the button knowing full well that someone may die she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own in the end she and her husband james <UNK> choose to kill norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind br br kelly dances around his film's message trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is obviously any person with a brain is saying at the beginning what if i was the person who dies richard kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal human conversation in fact they avoid it all together they appear to both be educated working at a <UNK> school and also for <UNK> so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to look outside of the box br br if he had the main characters actually have this conversation the entire movie could have ended right there instead we have to watch <UNK> go on forever <UNK> and the <UNK> be <UNK> to <UNK> stewart taking over these government programs <UNK> to show <UNK> life beyond our world so it will be easier to kill his wife and controlled by <UNK> which can be anywhere and nowhere at any time br br the most painful part of this movie is the pacing nothing really happens its a muddled <UNK> mash of ideas that are laughable br br it is <UNK> how this film is being <UNK> the commercials make it look like saw and even use the music from those films to sell it in reality what you get is a slow dull laughable yes half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects and messy film which is neither imaginative interesting nor cohesive at one point cameron diaz and her son are <UNK> and then suddenly she is back in the big black car with her husband on the way home where did she go why did they take her do we really care not anymore you won't br br by the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters you will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end go see anything else that's playing don't waste your time or money
<START> i have tried to like this show i really have but i can't find a reason why anyone would like it the story lines are weak the acting is weak and unbelievable every cast member seems to have been picked up off the street at random and it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for jamie <UNK> spears to be able to move on to movies every episode shows <UNK> as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date she's always perfect and no one is like that in real life how can people relate to a character that is just a <UNK> doll jamie <UNK> acting is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have the lead role in a series all the show's fans are just young girls who don't know any better i'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that isn't quickly directed to a beach party please accept my opinions and find something worthwhile to watch
<START> have just got back from seeing this brilliantly funny film br br granted part of the reason i loved it so was because i could point out people and places i knew 'i walk there everyday ' 'i work there ' <UNK> had drinks there ' <UNK> that's our <UNK> ' etc but still if you're out for a <UNK> <UNK> with a bit of spice excuse the pun this is just the right answer relationships culture and most importantly love are all woven together within the plot br br with preston where the film is set recently being made a city it is good to see this work featuring the place and adding to the feeling of it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north br br fabulous
<START> what's the matter with you people john <UNK> from <UNK> and unforgettable too quirky knocking emma thompson and alan <UNK> for having fun playing against type and somebody liked the <UNK> man br br i rented this not knowing anything about it and found it about as nifty a video find as you can get never insulting well thought out funny scary i disagree with the <UNK> clearly i thought the story itself was <UNK> but the great cast which most likely means the director was paying attention lifted it to super cool status good sound design also much more appreciated in surround but i'm not <UNK> and yes i'm a girl so maybe it has a slight female <UNK> the guys in the gang are pretty worthwhile all in all a 9 and a <UNK> recommend
<START> the director is sweet as is his co directing wife but their movie sucks it has its moments and some pretty girls but there is too much of everything <UNK> meets breaking the waves meets pauline at the beach you walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens be it in movies or in real life instead you get a <UNK> writer a neurotic actress and an illegal immigrant come social worker with a heart of gold it feels like there's more than one truly touching story hidden in the script but at face value it's a <UNK> of wasted story lines and sentimental <UNK> hard to sit out as it is
<START> i think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the east german regime the <UNK> of its people by what the regime called its anti fascist protective wall it is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed i would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape it did not happen in or around berlin as supposed by some <UNK> and was nothing to do directly with the berlin wall the escape balloon was <UNK> over the iron curtain which not only divided germany but it divided the whole of europe at that time the balloon took off from <UNK> miles south west of berlin in the german <UNK> republic east germany and flew 14 miles to in and freedom in west germany the opening of the iron curtain in <UNK> in 1989 <UNK> the fall of the berlin wall later that year whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema it should remain as a <UNK> to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from east berlin other parts of the or other soviet controlled states
<START> i honestly expected more from this movie that may have been the problem there was not one time when the camera was still ever on close ups the camera shakes the subjects move and i get a headache the cuts are so often and so fast that the viewer often finds himself herself wondering what just happened look out spoiler alert and at the end of the movie when you expect to have a happy ending after being put through so much useless thought to comprehend what is going on they end up losing to me this was a basically terrible movie <UNK> by a camera man with <UNK> and lack of a meaningful meaningful plot
<START> this is a pale imitation of and a gentleman ' there is no chemistry between <UNK> and the unknown woman who plays his love interest the dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed it's too long and the climax is anti climactic i love the its men and women are <UNK> and tough the action scenes are awesome but this movie doesn't do much for <UNK> i fear the script is formulaic but confusing character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault <UNK> is raging against the dying of the light but why his <UNK> with his wife is about as deep as a mud <UNK> i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my <UNK> worth
<START> this is probably one of the best thrillers i have ever seen it has action but not this bullet flying good guys bad guys van damme stallone action but quick realistic and nervous action it has a plot cause till the very end of the movie you don't know how this is gonna end it has characters <UNK> quinn donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect and it has suspense this movie just won't let you go away before you've seen the end of it br br though there are only a few characters i didn't find it difficult to keep my attention the the story and as for the story it's basic not too tom <UNK> difficult but simple and raw and realistic br br if you're in for a movie with a good story some action and great acting watch this and i promise you won't go away till you've seen the end of it the very end of it
<START> so madonna isn't meryl streep still this is one of her first films and a comedy at that give her a break sure the movie is mediocre at best and <UNK> in comparison to its earlier counterpart w <UNK> hepburn bringing up baby for what it is though a piece of fluff it's quite a bit of fun to watch i've yet to hear anyone that <UNK> <UNK> acting skills back it up w evidence or even <UNK> other than awful bad or other such vague <UNK> words if you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing how about <UNK> <UNK> she's had the most <UNK> commercial success of any actress in history and couldn't act her way out of a the american public obviously cannot <UNK> the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power i think madonna has always been at least credible in her movies get real people madonna bashing is so 90's
<START> i am very <UNK> in my reviews and as an academic writer try to give creative license to tv writers trying to a true story this story about karen carpenter could have helped so many yet due to the directing and editing does not br br the story in this case is not fully addressed unless one reads psychological <UNK> while <UNK> portrays a realistic karen it is sad that so much has been edited louise <UNK> portrays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogue in this case i give the actors credit for surviving this project br br why is the audience not <UNK> to see factors american audiences are quite <UNK> and if they have cable usually educated br br i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story would not have edited out the truth and allowed the actors to project the reality br br richard carpenter as director has seriously <UNK> and insulted american audiences <UNK> story is important and it is sad we will never hear it
<START> this show is absolutely fantastic it provides all the great drama and romance of teen shows like the <UNK> and <UNK> but it's a whole lot funnier it's a show with morals and values without everything being sugar <UNK> and <UNK> ala <UNK> heaven we don't have <UNK> or <UNK> in australia and our university system is completely different so i have no idea how accurately greek life is portrayed but i don't care because this show is my new favourite any writer that can make me love a racist <UNK> flag waving bible <UNK> must be genius br br and is my new <UNK> sorry josh jackson you've been
<START> watching this movie really surprised me i have never found myself to stop watching a movie in its entirety because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good amount of money and darn it i should at least watch the whole thing and get my <UNK> worth i made it through about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy movie when i thought to myself i am now a little more dumber after watching this movie i can't believe that the director and actors in this movie actually had that low of respect for themselves to allow this to be released br br there's nothing i can say that hasn't been said by the other reviewers but even in the worst of films there are usually one or two decent performances not in this piece of pathetic garbage i've seen better acting in high school plays every and i mean every <UNK> is bad beyond belief and what's truly amazing is the <UNK> of the badness gosh it must have been the director where did they get these people br br this is possibly one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen although entertaining in places due to its laughable script and even weaker acting and i use that term very loosely it is unfortunate that this film was not <UNK> to b movie hell for all eternity what could have been a good idea has been ruined by an ultra low budget poor sound and effects and actors who probably earned their wings in children's television and poor children's television at that br br please stay away from this movie not even worth a minute of your time
<START> joan fontaine is swept off her feet by the suave cary grant after their marriage she realizes that her husband is very irresponsible and owes a major gambling debt it appears that grant tries to scheme his best friend <UNK> bruce out of part of his life <UNK> bruce ends up murdered and fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance money this drama drags on to an abrupt and flat finale
<START> ok this is one strange film fans of ed wood jr will appreciate the inventive techniques director george barry <UNK> like stock footage and cheesy voice overs he can make a crack in the wall into a plot device there is more humor than horror here but i found it an uneven blend you will be laughing and crying and probably wondering why you got your hands on this barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of 10 000 that's <UNK> months and 9 <UNK> too much if you like your cheese on the campy side with vintage '70s gore you might find this an irresistible and freaky <UNK>
<START> next stop on our journey through the <UNK> slasher scene is oh yes <UNK> day all of those <UNK> just <UNK> with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults that is however if they can make it to <UNK> without having to <UNK> with the campus lunatic who's running around <UNK> the life out of students with his <UNK> sword yeah it all <UNK> from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood <UNK> during a race and a year later her older sister returns home from the navy for <UNK> the track coach holds the blame and <UNK> in his position in shop class while the girl's boyfriend still <UNK> her death a year later all of these characters are prime candidates for serial slasher of the year and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who done it <UNK> day is fun though it isn't spell original by any means and there aren't a whole lot of memorable <UNK> but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the music teacher and getting <UNK> with a joint 30 year old actors playing teenagers and of course gotta love that crap you can do a lot worse than <UNK> day <UNK>
<START> <UNK> machine is a crime drama set in early 80's <UNK> it stars burt reynolds as a <UNK> cop who is <UNK> on stopping crime and corruption in his city the story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been <UNK> the city to it's knees <UNK> link to bringing down this <UNK> is a high <UNK> hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie the action sequences are well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack score are pretty good the acting is b level but this is a pretty decent film to have in your dvd collection br br overall 7 10 br br peace br br
<START> this is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired or <UNK> in some other way the acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional and to let you know how bad the special effects are there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet moving it about the movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder when i saw this movie for the first time a <UNK> nearly <UNK> when my friends and i were calling each other names from this flick that's how terrible it was if you enjoy getting mad at movies i recommend this to you otherwise flee as though your very life <UNK> on it
<START> maybe it gets better i wouldn't know i made it through the first twenty minutes or so before cutting it off and entering a period of mourning it was obvious that the plot itself was a familiar one a man paul a professor of at columbia drives with his dog to a small town in <UNK> in search of his ex wife diana <UNK> there he encounters people who either ignore him or are hostile oh they may smile but there's something going on underneath br br that sort of <UNK> is home <UNK> for movie makers and viewers alike and it's pregnant with possibilities you can turn out a neatly drawn commercial success like bad day at black rock or it would have made and probably did make a nice twilight zone episode br br the cast includes some seasoned performers too as well as some <UNK> prominent names kenneth toby a veteran of science fiction is the <UNK> <UNK> motel manager diana <UNK> can give an impressive performance as she did in say for some of the others their range is limited br br but it's poorly directed and <UNK> written br br example of <UNK> direction that dog of is disliked by kenneth toby right off the bat so when walks out to the street toby <UNK> up to the window of his room peers in at the dog and something <UNK> cut to in the street he hears his dog howling away then a <UNK> shot of presumably the dog <UNK> along towards then past him while the wind blows and at the camera cut to an identical shot coming from the other direction whatever the camera represents whatever is staring at is never shown maybe it was nothing because suddenly the wind stops and is alone in the street looking a little bit puzzled you should never have brought that dog in the first place remarks a smiling toby from the <UNK> question what the hell is that scene all about br br example of <UNK> writing well two examples 1 if you were to sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a small town diner without the exercise of any craft whatever you'd come up with an <UNK> babe with her hair <UNK> on top of her head chewing <UNK> <UNK> among the tables right 2 anything resembling believability is thrown out the window in favor of special effects car <UNK> to a halt then explodes while it is waiting to be fixed at the garage to a halt believable exploding supernatural not even edgar allan poe would <UNK> such an event br br and the <UNK> themselves think of a modest masterpiece like invasion of the body <UNK> something is going wrong in dr kevin <UNK> small town and it takes half the movie for the mystery to be <UNK> and all the time suspense is building and doubt is growing here twenty minutes into the movie a stranger walks into a motel room and tears off his plastic face revealing a <UNK> light <UNK> naked brain the <UNK> is <UNK> br br i won't tell you the ending because i don't know what it is nor do i care i suppose it had something to do with insects because why else would paul be an by the way who's handling his classes but i'm not even sure bugs were involved it's entirely possible that the bug business was the writers may have made him a <UNK> in insects and then forgot all about it it wouldn't surprise me
<START> the strong points in the film were clear for the beginning and middle part of the film it showed how a very violent <UNK> authority might react to resistance filmed in the fashion of a documentary the director captures what would have happened if the united states <UNK> martial law <UNK> for punishment park a training ground for cops where you're <UNK> and <UNK> would offer you an out to this dire scenario it switches between the court trials for those facing <UNK> those who are in the park escaping police attention the training of officers preparing to handle these prisoners the judges in their <UNK> time among many other things it was a very strong deeply moving film br br the only fault i had with this was its realism officers are often seen holding their <UNK> like they were seven years old with a plastic toy i e a 90 degree bent <UNK> when pointing a gun in someone's face or the way one cop just makes it look like it's hard to kick someone when they're down etc etc it starts out as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs by the end of the film the viewer is slowly reminded again and again of the prejudices of the director and the producers the antagonist characters in the story start out as genuine real human beings and then slowly progress into stereotypical forces of evil by the very end the mistakes they make are stupid the force they demonstrate is unreal and unlike the way real police act the judges during this court hearing are shown making stupid and unreal mistakes among many other things br br the <UNK> of the movie started to fall apart when it became evident that this was just another blank check attempt to make government look bad and that's coming from an <UNK> the scenes at the end started to get hokey unreal and a thousand times over dramatic still for the earlier part of it it promises some very moving storyline
<START> i first saw this movie in the theater i was 10 i just watched it a second time and i must say it was amazing the music the dancing the acting it is a great story and told extremely well i fell absolutely in love with treat williams when i was a kid after seeing him in this movie one of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants and then finally said how much do you need money that was classic br br <UNK> are the best if you haven't seen this movie since it came out i say see it again it's timeless it will do what all great movies do make you laugh cry and think
<START> never ever have i been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people that faces a crisis or many in some ways a little like short cuts but totally different at the same time br br there are a heap of lead characters whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold and they are as persons show their good and their bad sides their weaknesses and their strengths with lots of drama and laughter br br the closest equivalent in a us movie i can think of which then is far weaker in every respect is the royal <UNK> br br four shades of brown as the title would be in english tells the story about a <UNK> out and his wife and his elderly parents who are traveling <UNK> about the <UNK> at an animal and his family <UNK> about the members of a cooking course who mostly talk about their sorry lives and <UNK> about the funeral for a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who tries to continue <UNK> the family from beyond the grave by singing and appearing in 3d during the funeral thanks to high tech equipment that has cost his entire fortune the family gets <UNK> not even the famous horse is given to the family br br there is a warmth and compassion in this film that is filled with grief and laughter that i've never experienced before br br most actors were new to me except robert and one or two more but they all deserve the big slam the film took at the swedish <UNK> the swedish oscar awards a week ago br br male female and male supporting actor <UNK> went to this film plus a few more to boot br br if you have the chance go and see it the hours <UNK> by very quickly
<START> spoilers bruce willis the part time comic and funny guy plays a hispanic assassin <UNK> after an african <UNK> <UNK> dog i guess all the good hispanic <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> snake <UNK> whip blade etc were not available and why would some south american assassin be <UNK> with a terrorist from the irish <UNK> army last time i checked the ira is not looking to open any branch <UNK> in south america and why would some prison tough battle weary irish terrorist look like a middle aged richard gere i thought maybe this movie was going to be a spoof of the crying game when <UNK> character was introduced as the person who was going to hunt down the what bad casting and why would the fbi be hiring <UNK> terrorists in order to track down <UNK> it seems like a terrorist goes for mass destruction and an assassin usually hits one target in a non spectacular manner but gere is the only person who has ever seen willis alive according to the fbi i thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very great film day of the but this movie is just a dumber version of <UNK> with stallone and <UNK> both of these movies are really dumb and part of the dumb <UNK> is the fact that as the audience we are forced to watch bruce willis go through his routines and we should say wow isn't he smart the professional with jean reno was a much better movie about <UNK> the is just a movie about two fat middle aged millionaire actors who could get paid for standing around looking pretty and pretending to be smart the is so poor that i expected to see sly stallone dennis <UNK> mickey rourke and jean van making cameo appearances as other or fbi needless to say the has <UNK> the fbi for twenty five years but as soon as richard gere gets on the job it is only a few days before the is i guess the positive message of this movie is thanks to terrorists our streets are safe from <UNK> overall the has no redeeming qualities
<START> i recently got the seven ups on video and i must say it was a very enjoyable movie roy <UNK> and tony lo <UNK> are great as the cop and crook respectively and a young richard lynch is great as psycho henchman moon the late bill <UNK> is pretty good as his associate bo and sets up a brilliant car chase sequence which will have you on the edge of your seats the other three members of the seven ups team are pretty bland but that's only to be expected br br i'm glad that a lot of people on this site have supported this movie i think it should be a film that should be released on dvd and not just forgotten i certainly enjoyed every minute of it the final scene between the two leads is excellent as the bad guy must face the consequences of his actions the seven ups does not disappoint
<START> albert <UNK> delivers a very good action drama about a <UNK> who tries to rip off a big crime lord a lot of style and many very cool actors burt is excellent
<START> the cast played shakespeare br br shakespeare lost br br i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses but why ruin something so good br br is it because 'the scottish is my favorite shakespeare i do not know what i do know is that a certain <UNK> hence tried to do something similar in the victorian era br br in other words you cannot improve perfection br br i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my <UNK> i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it
<START> and also a wonderful beginning a real quick start it keeps you yearning and waiting for is about to come unfortunately the high <UNK> <UNK> off quickly but most certainly after half the movie is over br br and it's a shame because this movie has really good ideas and explores many of them thoroughly but that is also one of it's faults by exploring too many things it <UNK> mixed up into to many things so in the end you're too confused to follow any plot or characters it's very dark and moody but that doesn't help much if it's also genre <UNK> just to try to fit any and everything in it's story
<START> better than average world war ii era who <UNK> it featuring warner <UNK> as a former gangster who suffered <UNK> and has been <UNK> as a psychiatrist now known as robert who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight crime doctor's courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems the link to courage is not particularly clear br br this entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter gordon carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but dr <UNK> murder <UNK> brooke plays the part of widow kathleen carson who is involved with anthony caruso a mysterious spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage as a mystery novelist <UNK> <UNK> is a good supporting actor as is lloyd <UNK> as an <UNK> in crime br br spooky houses with <UNK> doors <UNK> in the <UNK> and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense the set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good direction production design and photography stand out the exterior shots and costumes suggest more <UNK> rather than normally found in the average b detective thriller br br strongly recommended
<START> how poor is this movie well i got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about br br i also paid a <UNK> for this on dvd the old story of <UNK> a new cover on the box and some fool will buy <UNK> syndrome all i really recall it that the cast ran around a lot use of cars must have been too above the budget and that a vampire was involved then again guess you could know that from the film's title br br straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap jack dvd as it is now this stuff will be in the bargain <UNK> at rental <UNK> <UNK> and charity <UNK> until the death of the sun only <UNK> will rule the earth but this trash will still be around god bless the dawn of the dvd age
<START> sure the film is full of black <UNK> stereotypes and much of the <UNK> of the time in that sense the movie has indeed dated but as a satirical look at america's number one <UNK> industry advertising it's still on target but just as important is the counter message namely the effect of big bucks on those who would make the industry more socially promoting war toys alcohol etc thus the movie's also about the <UNK> of capitalism note for example how <UNK> suddenly changes to resemble third world revolutionary <UNK> just before he pulls out of the firm for a moment it looks like mini revolution has succeeded among his staff and he's moving on maybe to spread the movement but then the former <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> of big bucks and he <UNK> shaking his head perhaps to <UNK> a plane to cuba <UNK> final word however is an <UNK> one as the arab i believe burns down the money tower leaving the <UNK> structure of advertising capitalism a smoking ruin to me this looks like change can only succeed as a <UNK> act of destruction and not as a process of message consistent with the radical spirit of the time br br whatever the subtext there are some genuinely funny moments especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then those who compare the <UNK> style to that of the marx bros make a good point the throw away lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous set ups forty years later it's still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on despite the however the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely telling moments
<START> so well done the photography sound music and the performances were the best it's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene i loved it and i'm a 60 year old <UNK> guy each character seemed to fit their part to a <UNK> it's the best performance that i've seen from ms <UNK> she's been in more movies than i thought but this was a wonderful achievement i suppose it's a plus to have spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically two of the cast have successful t v shows of their own now it's easy to see why tom <UNK> does his usual good job
<START> this film is strange even for a silent movie essentially it follows the adventures about a engineer in post revolutionary russia who <UNK> about going to mars in this movie it seems like the producers know the <UNK> have truly screwed up the country but also seems to want to make it look like they've accomplished something good br br then we get to the martian scenes where everyone on mars wears goofy hats they have a revolution after being inspired by the earth men but are quickly betrayed by the queen who sides with them except it's all a dream or is it and given that the russian revolution eventually lead to the <UNK> <UNK> it makes you wonder if it was all allegory br br now i've seen good russian cinema for instance <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a good movie this is just well silly
<START> for some perverse reason best known to themselves these imdb boards seem reluctant to credit the great billy wilder as co scriptwriter on at least two this one and <UNK> of his early classics when any buff can <UNK> the wilder hand at work as it happens this represented the first time he was teamed with charles <UNK> who does get a credit and it was a great start one <UNK> has noted how satisfying it is to see these type of films in old fashioned cinemas and i couldn't agree more in paris one of the smaller revival houses shows in one of its <UNK> a more or less continuous lubitsch <UNK> and i'm pleased to report that this played to a very <UNK> audience right across the age spectrum though i doubt whether any were actually alive when it was first released in 1938 the famous wilder <UNK> the meet cute is particularly tasty here when millionaire but careful with it cooper attempts to buy half a set of <UNK> in a department store on the <UNK> and meets with sales resistance until <UNK> <UNK> turns up and agrees to buy the other half the gag is <UNK> even more when having exhausted the chain of command at the store itself the manager places a call to the owner who is in bed and leaves it to reveal that he too is only wearing the top half of <UNK> the film is full of sight gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect <UNK> <UNK> is only terrific and gets great backing from edward everett <UNK> as her <UNK> titled father david niven in fourth billing has some funny as does franklin <UNK> and if gary cooper is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal <UNK> and sophisticated persona that wilder scripts called for at this stage of his career well you can't have everything and what you do have is <UNK> near perfect
<START> dr <UNK> starts shortly after teenager robert <UNK> mum has died he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver <UNK> in this case it appears that his mum owns a <UNK> cabin at lake the self <UNK> <UNK> place for happy <UNK> that she didn't tell him about so nicholas together with his girlfriend jessica crisp three friends jimmy butch <UNK> reese chase <UNK> <UNK> ashley mccarthy head out there for a fun weekend unfortunately things don't go according to plan the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed their <UNK> turn out to be dr <UNK> ed <UNK> his two <UNK> who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments br br going straight to video dvd dr <UNK> was edited directed by lewis this film seems to be having a hard time here on the imdb with some pretty harsh reviews while i think dr <UNK> as a horror film is pretty worthless i don't think some of the criticism i've read is entirely justified the script which takes itself very seriously is credited to ian holt whether he likes it or not who has a role in the film as detective <UNK> according to the imdb cast list although i can't remember any character of that name maybe he was one of the cops at the start anyway the basic story is alright i suppose although it's a tad dull lasts for too long it's typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around <UNK> off our annoying american teen cast you know the <UNK> by now besides some brief undeveloped nonsense about dr <UNK> using body parts to <UNK> his own <UNK> body there's not much story here the script seems to exist solely to <UNK> situations for girls to take their tops off there's the inevitable sex scenes there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a <UNK> house <UNK> topless there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing oh when i say topless i mean they aren't wearing any tops but they all keep their <UNK> on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any actual full frontal nudity in dr <UNK> at all so there you have it really it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted is populated with poor clichéd dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes girls in <UNK> to be honest i expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe i'm just being <UNK> br br director does ok actually this is by no means the worst looking film i've seen although it still looks cheap there's no style here i didn't think it was scary there's no atmosphere either the gore is restrained <UNK> to some dead bodies severed limbs there's nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects dr <UNK> is also one of those films where character decisions motivations are ridiculous br br technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like <UNK> front room the two <UNK> outfits at the start look like stripper outfits the acting is alright it could have better but i've certainly seen worse br br dr <UNK> indeed features a doctor who rides around on a <UNK> <UNK> but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace
<START> i don't much mind the factors that others here have <UNK> to acting lighting and so forth for the most part these things were executed well enough to carry the film and put its points across it's just a horror film after all br br what <UNK> me were the points themselves because this is a deeply <UNK> film and its morality is deeply tacky in fact it's actually <UNK> christian morality and this is a <UNK> christian film look at the <UNK> br br <UNK> character picked on a kid at school when he was a pre teen leading to his accidental death br br <UNK> character used <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and good looks to <UNK> quite a few women some of whom he <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> how unlucky for him that women are such passive <UNK> creatures that they had no <UNK> in the matter br br <UNK> character's dad came back from vietnam a <UNK> so ashamed to be caught shooting up that he kills himself yes what a terrible sin why couldn't he have just become an alcoholic like all the others br br and <UNK> character picked on another <UNK> how awful the fact that he was a child himself apparently counts for <UNK> children it seems are <UNK> judged by adult <UNK> br br well maybe lots of people support this level of moral it certainly seems to have gone <UNK> in this movie's comments does everyone just buy this stuff at least human laws treat children differently from adults <UNK> that their <UNK> sense is partially formed this film has no such <UNK> and i find that pretty <UNK> <UNK> the notion that women are helpless <UNK> creatures before young men's evil <UNK> or that a vietnam vet driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option pathetic
<START> this could have been a very good film a very interesting look at ancient tradition and <UNK> history but it should have been a short subject as it is it moves at a <UNK> pace sure that's part of the life being portrayed but this was unbearable i fell asleep watching them make soup and that was a highlight
<START> <UNK> is a giant lovable gentle and <UNK> st bernard owned by the family during the opening sequence <UNK> chases a rabbit over fields and through a local wood somewhere in castle rock <UNK> the rabbit disappears into a <UNK> and <UNK> sticks his head into the entrance hole the rabbit <UNK> from sight angry <UNK> starts to <UNK> and in doing so inadvertently wakes up and annoy a colony of bats one of which bites him on the nose donna <UNK> dee wallace stone as dee wallace is having an affair with steve christopher stone dee <UNK> real life husband which her husband <UNK> daniel hugh kelly who works in advertising discovers obviously their relationship becomes strained happily oblivious to all of this is their young son tad danny joe ed <UNK> <UNK> cars for a living out of his <UNK> on his <UNK> joe is planning a guys weekend with one of his friends gary mills watson when his wife charity lee wins 5 000 on the <UNK> and decides to take their young boy brett billy <UNK> as billy <UNK> with her on a trip to see her parents arriving at <UNK> house to pick him up joe finds him dead on the floor he goes into the kitchen to call for help and his dog <UNK> who is now <UNK> attacks and kills him donna and tad drive to the <UNK> to try and get her car <UNK> the place is deserted except for <UNK> who is now completely <UNK> <UNK> at the mouth his fur <UNK> red with blood and <UNK> by pain <UNK> attacks the car to try and get at donna and tad luckily for them the windows hold firm at least for the time being anyway donna tries to start the car but it has completely broken down they are both trapped with nothing but the hope that someone will come and rescue them <UNK> lies in wait ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path directed by lewis i thought the film was a bit slow for my tastes the first half <UNK> along the second half builds up a head of steam but i still felt it was a little <UNK> and <UNK> the acting is fine by everyone involved i've no complaints there technically the film is ok photography music special effects editing and it's generally well made the big problem is the script by don carlos <UNK> and lauren and in particular it's first half most of which appears to be padding to stretch the run time out <UNK> in at just under the 90 minute mark it felt longer it's also a little predictable as well <UNK> as a monster never really scared me either i just don't find <UNK> overweight st scary i guess i suppose there's nothing really wrong with it but i don't think i'd be in a hurry to see it again average not too bad if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on t v for free
<START> the silent film masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> by the soviet government to celebrate the 20th <UNK> of the <UNK> of <UNK> and to establish the event as an heroic <UNK> of the october revolution of <UNK> ironically the film's director <UNK> <UNK> was one of the earliest and most influential <UNK> of a approach to film art subsequently <UNK> <UNK> and suspect politics would cause <UNK> conflicts with government <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> realism influenced by the russian film <UNK> and through him by d w <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into russia in <UNK> <UNK> constructed his films from a <UNK> of rapidly edited images a montage of shots varied in length motion content lighting and camera angle without question the most memorable <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> approach and probably the single most <UNK> and studied sequence in world cinema history is the <UNK> steps sequence in <UNK> br br in structure <UNK> is a five <UNK> divided into five narrative parts an organization clearly derived from the five act <UNK> of western drama in men and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the pre revolutionary <UNK> and <UNK> of the working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to <UNK> even before the sailors and their upper class officers masters are visually introduced <UNK> <UNK> revolutionary conditions <UNK> by the <UNK> editing of waves breaking violently and <UNK> at sea <UNK> ship we witness crowded conditions <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> with shots of <UNK> <UNK> harsh labor and most <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> meat intended for the <UNK> meal the <UNK> <UNK> is brought forward by the other officers to <UNK> the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup <UNK> like the rage in <UNK> with <UNK> the church also fails the men and we see one of them <UNK> a plate <UNK> with words from the <UNK> <UNK> from two different camera angles in perhaps the first deliberate jump cut in cinema history br br identified by inter titles as drama on the and an appeal from the dead <UNK> second and third parts depict the actual <UNK> and the funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution united by appeals to <UNK> the initial are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers a chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by <UNK> editing techniques the <UNK> quarters are <UNK> and symbols of their <UNK> are destroyed the <UNK> doctor is thrown overboard accompanied by dramatic to the <UNK> ridden meat and his <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> death is the price paid for the revolt no <UNK> without breaking eggs and he is laid out with dignity on an <UNK> <UNK> hundreds of ordinary <UNK> citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to <UNK> death to the <UNK> shots of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the birth of revolutionary consciousness br br the complex and unforgettable <UNK> steps sequence <UNK> the film's fourth act it begins with uplifting music and a series of close ups and medium shots on the <UNK> faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects <UNK> <UNK> baby <UNK> suddenly as <UNK> a title card in huge letters the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn <UNK> and fixed <UNK> appear at the top of the steps here <UNK> releases the full force of <UNK> editing as nearly a hundred shots are <UNK> together to contrast the <UNK> mayhem and <UNK> of the <UNK> with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the <UNK> horses and flying <UNK> of the waiting below the <UNK> en scene is framed by a statue of <UNK> at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom symbolic for <UNK> oppressive <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> christian church br br <UNK> the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children in the first a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the <UNK> faces in the crowd are among the first victims the boy is shot but the mother continues running until close ups of her face convey her horrified <UNK> at the son's fallen body being <UNK> by the crowd with a much <UNK> editing pace the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers shown only in a <UNK> shadow line they <UNK> shoot her dead after this <UNK> the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach the <UNK> of mother russia as she tries to shield her baby in its <UNK> in a scene <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> slips down the <UNK> horrified faces of <UNK> citizens watch the slow progress to its doom when the <UNK> reaches the bottom there is a cut to a wielding a sword and a classic effect suggests what we do not actually see the <UNK> of this pure and symbolic innocent the final series of shots in the <UNK> sequence is of three stone lions one in <UNK> one sitting up and one roaring the editing <UNK> them into a visual metaphor of the people's <UNK> rage br br somewhat the fifth act returns us to the <UNK> as the <UNK> sailors flee on the high <UNK> and <UNK> an encounter with other ships from the fleet they and the viewer expect <UNK> but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years but that <UNK> aside <UNK> <UNK> stands as one of the <UNK> works of the silent film era and it <UNK> extraordinary cinematic power
<START> this movie is excellent i watched the french version there are many subplots which usually <UNK> from the whole but they nicely unfold and <UNK> to the discovering of one's real self main theme in fact the whole movie besides his background is the journey to the discovery of one's or someone else's self is the king really a good <UNK> trying to <UNK> a war to end all wars or is he just a disturbed blood <UNK> <UNK> is he a true king after all is the attendant to the queen mother just a <UNK> career driven <UNK> <UNK> puppet or rather a sharp thinking bold individual will the dame <UNK> realize who the king truly is what's between the king and the old <UNK> what's the secret everyone knows but won't tell what's the true reason the assassin quit his job subplots something i'm not particularly fond of are handled well and keep one watching until the end scenes are well crafted and cgi fits nicely in without going overboard suspense is properly <UNK> and actors are <UNK> the task there is a lot of brain damaged smiling but that is how one was supposed to behave at the king's court as the dame <UNK> complains about realistic movie without superhero moments this chinese movie really puts hollywood cardboard gladiator etc to shame
<START> the tv show was slow moving and the characters were sometimes irritating only through the miracle of fast forward was i able to make it through the first 2 hours br br the write up <UNK> that it's some kind of comedy mystery but i didn't see much of either br br if it really picks up after the first 2 hours please let me know because i doubt that i will watch the rest without a recommendation br br this review is supposed to be without spoilers so i will continue in a vague non spoiler fashion i found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic i found myself asking a normal adult do that ' the man with the <UNK> <UNK> looking out the window was irritating and when the male lead <UNK> with him he looked pathetic would a normal adult put up with someone as irritating as him
<START> this is the type of film that makes you question your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose body of work doesn't contain a few <UNK> br br the casting in <UNK> films is of <UNK> importance because he puts the viewer into such <UNK> with the characters the actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity otherwise it is just hollow br br none of the actors in this film had any of that screen magic in my opinion br br jeremy <UNK> and patricia fell far short as the leads <UNK> is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part lovable rogue didn't suit his strengths his brand of charm also hit a false note for me here persona is too <UNK> <UNK> to fit into a <UNK> love story br br although i would hesitate to pass up any opportunity to hear an english accent i also think an american actor would have worked better in this role so many of the songs that sings are so closely identified with the of the particular <UNK> that it seemed kind of <UNK> to then have jeremy <UNK> playing the love interest even though <UNK> it really didn't matter it still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow at least for me br br of course it would have had to have been the right american i think george clooney would have been great in the part and he would have brought the screen magic in <UNK> brad pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy br br i was also very disappointed with patricia in reading about her i've learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans so what do i know but i found her screen presence as a singer very boring she was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song nothing she sang moved me she was pleasant but bland br br in contrast someone like kate hudson who is not a professional singer and has only voice coach french still would have handled this part a million times better not to mention all that stunning french talent out there that could have been <UNK> into it was wrenching watching patricia take up screen space when there are so many charismatic french actresses who could have been cast instead br br the music was so important in this film it could not really work without the music working and since delivered so poorly in this respect the movie never really had a chance br br <UNK> sealed the fate of this movie when he cast patricia
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is the first cartoon with sound mickey mouse is working on a <UNK> on board he is making music with all kind of tools most of those tools are farm animals this first one with sound is one of the better and funnier ones it has some very clever moments a short classic
<START> it came before the ten <UNK> land of the <UNK> ben <UNK> and it's overlooked today how unfair based on <UNK> novel it doesn't <UNK> it novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice i hope it will be done some day whose message is essentially christian remains intact another of his books the secret of the kingdom first part takes place after <UNK> death in the holy land br br the egyptian is the rising of a <UNK> close to long before christ the <UNK> <UNK> is some kind of <UNK> who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world he asks to return good for evil and he has <UNK> who will eventually turn into <UNK> the scene when simmons and the other <UNK> of the sun god are <UNK> is visually stunning looking like some <UNK> ballet for the priests on the other hand this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the <UNK> and that's why they look for a strong man mature who can lead the army against the as well as against their dangerous <UNK> another religion or non religion should we say is <UNK> who during two hours believes in nothing the sequence of the grain of <UNK> is absolutely sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average <UNK> br br there's another fascinating side the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama not only for the screenplay notably sister's tierney final revelation which <UNK> the ten <UNK> by two years but also the <UNK> of the cinematography in his book about <UNK> talks about a atmosphere blue and gold notably in the scenes which involve the prostitute who <UNK> her reflection in the water of her bath supreme <UNK> around the hero all the characters appear disappear appear again but when they <UNK> they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with <UNK> skill besides as such is often the case in modern <UNK> the story is a long flashback framed by two short sequences showing an old man who's remembering br br this is a wonderful sword and <UNK> that had a strong influence not only in america but also in europa notably in <UNK> where <UNK> directed a <UNK> 1966 which <UNK> a lot to <UNK>
<START> when i first saw this show advertised to be on australian tv back in the late 90's i ignored it thinking it was just <UNK> on the kevin <UNK> movie but then i caught an episode and i wish i had watched it from the start the <UNK> between sean pertwee and louise lombard was so well acted and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining it wasn't an overblown tv show that you can tell spent most of its energy in making things explode so that they could put that clip in the commercial to lure audiences and then not deliver on any other level the show <UNK> into the lives of the two main characters and thats what made it interesting the stories for each episode where also well written with interesting guest stars who were good actors and of course there was a lot of action and intrigue which is always good but what was great was that there was humour and it <UNK> naturally from the characters it didn't appear contrived it was british but in a good way and if this show was made in america it would no doubt be on dvd by now i don't know why british tv production companies are not interested in releasing this show on dvd it was a great show and deserves a dvd release
<START> the film made no sense to me whatsoever good actors favourite he was great in <UNK> but that was made by <UNK> a great italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort but awful rambling script terrible editing and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly nothing load of rubbish but the sort of film that certain <UNK> whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it and unfortunately italy has no <UNK> on these they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece i never thought much of as director i remember seeing his first film <UNK> in the pocket or some such title in rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago i was living the time all the usual <UNK> about it but it left me pretty cold i didn't think he was much of a director then and still don't age has certainly not improved him and this film must rank as one of his worst
<START> this should have been an amazingly funny movie but it falls flat on its face in fact i stopped watching it halfway through which is something i rarely do bill murray plays jack <UNK> a second rate <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> an elephant by his father whom he had presumed to be dead before he was born he then has one week to get the <UNK> across the country his adventures on the way are only mildly amusing at best <UNK> <UNK> considerable comedic talents go largely <UNK> anita <UNK> is impressive in her small role as jack's mother who has a lot of explaining to do and pat <UNK> stands out as a former circus associate of jack's father perhaps the second half of the movie was better than the first but i find that hard to believe
<START> this is the worst movie in the world the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a is this for real sort of way it was so cheesy and low budget they should not have even bothered there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it think <UNK> as blood and <UNK> for severed heads do not rent this
<START> being an israeli jew of naturally sarcastic nature as well as a lover of different and independent cinema it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a view on the holocaust that's sensitive and <UNK> while also being original and unusual while i haven't read the book  or for that matter heard of its existence prior to watching the film  and therefore cannot like some other reviewers comment on how they stack up in comparison everything is <UNK> gave me great pleasure and i can certainly comment on that br br to label everything is <UNK> a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice even though it is undeniably about the holocaust so would <UNK> it as a comedy or a travel film although it's about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving everything is <UNK> is about jonathan <UNK> <UNK>  played to <UNK> perfection by <UNK> wood in the most impressive dramatic performance i've seen him in yet with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all  a young american jew and an obsessive collector of family and historical <UNK> who travels to the <UNK> on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis it's also about alex his tour guide through the <UNK> and <UNK> grandfather what's fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of <UNK> character but both alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film and turn out to be at least as important as jonathan in fact boris as the grumpy self <UNK> blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the film br br aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters the beautiful mix of original <UNK> music and russian folk music the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history what made everything is <UNK> a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject several excellent films such as the grey zone and downfall have already given us the point of view of the lower rank nazis who are presented as human beings who aren't necessarily fully aware of the moral <UNK> of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war everything is <UNK> presents a point of view rarely treated before <UNK> point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people  and maybe his own family as well  were capable of the change in <UNK> attitude  and his <UNK>  towards jonathan towards the holocaust and towards the jewish people in general makes the film a fascinating and original study in character development br br everything is <UNK> is a terrific directorial debut for actor <UNK> <UNK> and one of the most original and unique films of 2005 it's a highly recommended viewing experience especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and world war ii
<START> i am sure i'm in the minority i know i am among my friends but i found this movie long boring and gratuitous the fact that the role played by denis <UNK> is the most likable character the only other time i liked him at all was in a bug's life speaks volumes <UNK> <UNK> character was irritating beyond belief and thomas <UNK> himself was flat and stereotypical to say he was two dimensional may be a little generous no the scenes with his psychiatrist did not help make him real br br with the exception of two wonderful scenes both involving the museum caper and not involving <UNK> russo this movie made me wish i were at home watching <UNK> golf
<START> when i saw that icon was on tv i was surprised i know that the first clue of where it was headed was the fact that it was on the hallmark channel has to be said sorry i was hopeful when i saw that <UNK> himself was the <UNK> producer but very quickly saw that the only real way that the tv movie and the book were similar were in the name and the character names only the tv plot was a ho hum to say the least but i <UNK> that in and of itself the action was worth a 3 stars in my personal opinion mr <UNK> could have portrayed a valid monk however i think that in order to do the movie justice it would have been a far longer movie and i don't think hollywood itself would have gone for the plot of by <UNK> a case in point is the terrible film version of the sum of all fears need i say more
<START> as listed and stated in many previous comments this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit indeed more than 20 years after it was originally <UNK> it is still watched and watched again and has a huge global fan following something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something right br br the root of the <UNK> brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters  all of which are brought to life by marvellous actors the characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity in contrast to many other robin hood adaptations and indeed many other film and tv productions in general the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws while the baddies although put forward as evil and ruthless frequently can be understood and even on occasion seem quite sympathetic this very much makes robin of <UNK> into a story about <UNK> real people  rather than of good and bad people  something which very much adds to its <UNK> and remarkable appeal also although very much being an action packed series featuring numerous amazing stunts which are remarkable in themselves seeing as this was made long before today's computer animation green screens and so forth thus behind every one of those endless guys falling off castle walls horses and catching fire there actually is a real person who at some point did fall off a castle wall or a horse or catch fire there is always amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode in the final analysis however it is generally the <UNK> baddies  <UNK> grace as the sheriff of <UNK> robert as sir guy of and philip jackson as the <UNK> hugo de  who get the very best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and cant it's a wedding not a celebration is just one of their many timeless <UNK> of wisdom which seems to follow one through life br br 20 years after the fact it is indeed hard to believe that robin of <UNK> was originally something made for television  and apparently not with a great deal of money  in order to provide fleeting saturday afternoon amusement for small children in great britain filmed in beautiful locations with clever amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors  many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show  this in numerous ways seems to be more <UNK> made and have more production value than many a hollywood film
<START> this is definitely a good movie unlike what other people are saying and i have both seen the movie and the end is cheesy but that is part of the package to experiment with death is the same as trying to defy it so the movie is cool for those who wish to see a classic kevin bacon movie see this please take care <UNK> from <UNK> we will write 10 lines if you really want us 2 but we think it is a waste of time bye the rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we just wrote it to fill the 10 line <UNK> which is crazy but we are kind people and will therefore adapt to the rules that are set out for us so people watch this movie not because we wrote 10 lines but because it is good and by the way we wrote 12 lines
<START> i like so many others on here bought this movie at my local <UNK> in the two for 11 00 cheap o bin i love cheesy b horror and sci fi movies and this one definitely fits in that category pretty much what everyone else on here said is dead on yes it was bad but that was to be expected the main problem i had with this movie is that it was just basically boring i mean serious yawn o <UNK> the acting was bad the costumes k mart <UNK> outfit circa 1982 were worse and the editing was awful no continuity whatsoever mr <UNK> ultimately dies in an explosion of sorts uh although he encountered multiple explosion throughout this move i guess the last one just took its <UNK> on him apparently earlier encounters with this military group <UNK> took its <UNK> on his horse it would change from red to black throughout this crap fest even for a b movie do yourself a favor and skip it the only good it serves me now it to add to my dvd collection hopefully no one will recognize it when they look through my movie collection thumbs down big time
<START> a nice humorous mix of music hall in the first third mostly and police <UNK> mystery as the various <UNK> stories start to collapse the final exposure of the murder may come as a surprise if you don't watch closely a gritty look at paris of the time you can ignore the final scene the hollywood ending louis <UNK> is best as the police inspector who seems to be just passing through but is really on top of things
<START> in yet another case of misleading marketing this film is included in a 10 movie dvd set called women who kick butt but even in its original cover it seems to promise shannon <UNK> in an action role actually during most of the movie <UNK> plays the typical whiny and <UNK> female character who has to be rescued by the male lead and even when she's trained in jungle <UNK> she still has to be dragged around by him there is one female rebel who is a stronger character but she's mostly kept in the <UNK> of the movie the male lead is <UNK> brown and he does have some unintentionally i think funny moments like when he gets <UNK> the action scenes are badly directed and poorly acted some of the <UNK> needed a few lessons on how to get shot and die convincingly i suppose if you're in the right mood you can find some things in firing line to laugh at at one point we can hear <UNK> speaking but her lips are not moving but mostly i was just bored
<START> the russian space station with a crew of four russians and two americans is threatening to re enter the <UNK> atmosphere in a matter of days russia asks for help in <UNK> the stranded crew and <UNK> <UNK> the space <UNK> atlantis the <UNK> also have an interest in the a prototype <UNK> power source being tested aboard and <UNK> for one of their men to be placed on the mission br br that's the plot onto less important things the space station and the <UNK> are the same blatantly obvious models used in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and a handful of other films i suspect the model effects are so obvious throughout the entire movie and make the film look very 1960s the sets are a little better but are far too '80s for what is supposedly a brand new station built by an american company which later comes in as part of a conspiracy to destroy and the and claim the insurance the script has a few good moments including farewell and the little <UNK> at the end but is otherwise fairly bland and sub standard the acting is okay the only real standout performance comes from alex who offers up some of the film's better dialogue michael <UNK> is surprisingly one of the best parts about this film ice t is ice t <UNK> said the film offers a few surprises though that i don't wish to spoil br br certainly one of the better low grade contemporary set sci fi films of the last six years but not the best the film is watchable but the special effects and plot will probably put a lot of viewers off rent the other sci fi film instead
<START> i rarely write reviews but this film simply demands more attention than it gets as it contains the most hysterical kidnapping gone <UNK> wrong sequence ever filmed br br i have only seen this once and found it to be the funniest film i had ever had the <UNK> to watch i laughed from beginning to end it is such a shame it is not out on dvd or video br br you can only compare its cinematography with that of it's a mad mad mad mad world or promise her anything only this storyline isn't nearly as complex as mad world br br i hope in the near future this film is released as it would be a shame to lose such a comedy gem amongst the <UNK> we have nowadays
<START> i happened to catch about the last 45 minutes of the movie late night about 8 years ago what a wild and funny 45 minutes i was absolutely knocked out by chase shoot out at the end that takes place at night inside an old hotel that's being torn down with a <UNK> ball incredible i vaguely remember <UNK> <UNK> stealing a cop car <UNK> being a cop and strong <UNK> some <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> hey why ya us <UNK> it's my job you're correct they don't make them like that anymore great movie the hopefully it will see the light of day as a dvd along with other lost <UNK> <UNK> and being one such
<START> this movie was not only disappointing to the horror suspense film lover it was disappointing to anyone who sees it wow i thought that this film might be funny because the guy with the huge head however it was filled with long and drawn out conversation that wasn't needed there was so much sex that i hate women and men now this film was not only boring but there was no substance wow wow on to of all this each scene looks like it was light from a single light <UNK> and i think they used the same set for two different lawyers a restaurant and an airport this movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies because in the end it feels likes wasted time see the movie br br party
<START> this show is awesome and we have been enjoying it thoroughly set in <UNK> i don't agree with the homosexual content on <UNK> show i feel that you are pushing too hard to bring new york to <UNK> its one thing to have a new <UNK> struggling in the <UNK> wild but to try to turn the <UNK> town into new york this is a nice show about <UNK> women and true <UNK> men and to bring a same sex couple into the mix is throwing the balance way off <UNK> should be portrayed as a man and new york as the woman i think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all are doing can't we have a nice show without the <UNK> of nature
<START> i saw roger moore <UNK> it on the scenes that required running or exercise he was a james bond who would be most comfortable sitting at a bar telling stories with his fellow british knights nothing against the elderly in age appropriate roles but how realistic is it for a <UNK> looking <UNK> year old man to be fighting on the wings of planes hanging off the side of a train swimming in a swamp with <UNK> etc aside from the fact that <UNK> was incredibly silly vapid and moronic the fact that a <UNK> <UNK> engaged in many death <UNK> stunts just made it so much easier to laugh at james bond by 1983 roger moore was clearly looking his age and he was long past the time when he looked like he could fight with younger men i saw this movie in the theater and the <UNK> of laughter were many and very often any credibility that james bond had built up was gone after <UNK> br br the only thing missing from <UNK> was benny hill and his supporting cast another low point was that the incredibly lame louis jordan was one half of the <UNK> of evil jordan helped to make the whole concept even more laughable and the russian general was a total goof <UNK> works better as a comedy spoof similar to spies like us br br even the fight scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes done in many other films by better actors take emperor of the north 1972 where lee marvin ernest <UNK> fought all over the top bottom of the train and made it look exciting and real br br roger moore had a thin <UNK> body in 1983 and yet his stunt double was clearly a younger <UNK> athletic muscular man even the hair color did not match this only made his fight scenes more comedic the moore stunts looked like those old low budget chop <UNK> kung fu movies especially with the bad editing the director seemed to try to make the bad acting and bad stunts better by providing several views of the same stunt this only <UNK> the differences between moore and his stunt double the fact that the train scenes with moore were shot inside a studio could be noticed from the lighting when moore was in the shot versus the exterior shots of the stunt double on a real train though many of the bond movies have to be the worst ever when it comes to editing their stunt fights you can usually clearly see that the bond actor is not actually fighting overall <UNK> has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made and easily the worst of the worst bond movies
<START> in <UNK> wrote this in his diary the political is not <UNK> with the artistic because the former in order to prove has to be one sided this thought from a great mind is <UNK> to usa the movie the film might be read by those with a narrow focus as a 90 minute slam of bush <UNK> et al as well as a ripping of america as an out of control force that will ultimately be destroyed by its own <UNK> and <UNK> for power the more open minded viewer will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this dvd a testament to thought as the main character breaks up into bits and pieces surrounded by recurring visuals of the natural world <UNK> with the man made <UNK> towers roads video <UNK> radio vehicles above all the ominous threat of wars that have been and are to come <UNK> throughout war and rumors of war are what is created destroyed and <UNK> on the screen in our conscious world and in our unconscious minds
<START> ladies and gentlemen we've really got ourselves a winner here actually we don't but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker poor <UNK> <UNK> julia <UNK> is suffering from an ancient <UNK> curse that causes lethal <UNK> snakes to grow inside of her body <UNK> and her deranged <UNK> husband <UNK> castro who <UNK> overacts with delicious eye rolling intensity <UNK> on a train that's bound for los angeles naturally a bunch of deadly <UNK> get lose so they can <UNK> the <UNK> assortment of passengers the brothers working from an absurd script by eric treat the ridiculous premise straight thereby creating a wonderfully wretched piece of <UNK> campy cheese the <UNK> cgi effects the <UNK> common variety <UNK> snakes there's would be scary <UNK> noises added to the soundtrack to <UNK> them with a faint sense of otherwise nonexistent menace the plodding pace the total <UNK> of any tension or momentum the obvious <UNK> stage bound train set and especially the simply astonishing you gotta be <UNK> me over the top preposterous ending are all downright awesome in their very jaw dropping awfulness better still we also got game if lame acting from a no name cast a nice <UNK> of tasty gratuitous female nudity a funky score and plenty of extremely gross and grotesque make up f x bonus points for the fact that the token <UNK> <UNK> little girl gets eaten by a large <UNK> and for the <UNK> engineer who gets caught smoking crack out of a hollow light <UNK> an absolute gut buster of a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i love this movie because every single element of it is nothing less than excellent i will quickly praise a few of them peter o'toole gives us one of his great performances as he becomes the definitive mr <UNK> clark has a beautiful voice and is perfect as <UNK> the director was able to bring the story to the screen in a fresh new way combine that with the fantastic and creative cinematography editing writing etc and you have a film that shows the fine quality of its production i can't praise the well planned camera work enough it moves us up and around <UNK> in and out giving us the best views of and letting the locations become part of the scene <UNK> last song <UNK> and <UNK> is just 3 beautifully composed long takes and in this era of 2 second takes i can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to give to get those long scenes perfect the music is great and the songs move the story along just as they should leslie is one of my favorite <UNK> listen to these songs how could anyone not like them this is a very romantic story between two people <UNK> middle age that find each other bring out the best in each other and it lasts till the end of their lives excellent production values acting camera work and music make this movie well worth watching
<START> it is a wonderful film about people strange people the characters in the movie all have a very tragic past so they all have their problems their problems <UNK> in a way that makes the plot of the movie very absurd but that does not make the movie worse only better for it is shot in a kind of fantasy like way so nothing is real this review might sound a little weird but then again the movie is not quite normal it is also a hilarious movie at many times if you have not seen it see it enjoy
<START> my 2nd favorite film of 1970 after five easy pieces was totally <UNK> by a lot of idiots calling in an audience <UNK> piece of trash peter boyle a well known liberal is incredible as the hard <UNK> working stiff who has a few problems with the younger generation he's a frightening dude but has a great imagination and is very funny i was a teenage liberal when this was released but as horrifying as joe seemed to me he also <UNK> me up susan sarandon in her first role is perfect and a mixed up stone rich fox the dinner scene in queens is hilarious and insightful for everybody involved br br this was not an exploitation film and the script which was oscar nominated should have won that year the director just didn't waste enough money making it to give it enough credibility in hollywood no matter your political then and now you'll like somebody in this film a definite 9 out of 10 it's on dvd and video check it out
<START> right where do i start i cannot even imagine to comprehend this <UNK> pathetic excuse of a show picture this a <UNK> school where kids whose parents are rolling in money simply chuck them in there so as to jet around the world themselves it could not get any more <UNK> than this br br if you taught these kids shall not even <UNK> them to the term teenagers because they hardly even act like sane were self centered think again about 23 minutes <UNK> full of their so called problems boy troubles and the like br br the heroine of the show of course <UNK> played by <UNK> polly pocket little miss i'm all that sister jamie <UNK> spears has obviously much to learn about acting however i will give her some face because her superficial one dimensional character does not allow much room for depth she plays pacific coast <UNK> sun moon and stars <UNK> fighting for the plight of all women <UNK> of all <UNK> br br perfect in <UNK> always with her two loyal <UNK> nicole the <UNK> bimbo who obviously has too much of <UNK> cash and tough chick dana who proves a hard nut to crack both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively not that i blame that but horror of horrors in comes lola who <UNK> herself the greatest actress since natalie wood with green <UNK> in her hair and fake <UNK> she is even more rude than <UNK> herself if that is even possible and even more dumber than nicole and hell we know that cannot be possible br br this show like all the sorry excuses for television <UNK> <UNK> has been <UNK> out since <UNK> is a prime victim of stereotyping get girl next door and dense to her best friend's feelings for her <UNK> a great albeit <UNK> at times best boy friend chase a cool arrogant ladies man logan a boy and clothes crazy girl who is not very bright nicole the one whom everyone thinks is weird just because she is extremely smart the nerd quinn the over dramatic annoying yet super thin <UNK> picture perfect model lola and the tough yet soft inside woman dana now where have i heard these characters before i am sorry but what is so wrong with having a personality just because quinn is passionate about science and actually cares about her future and doing well in the academic aspect in which the rest should be concerned about as well she is weird and a nerd lola at the beginning of the series proved to be a potential great character with her sassy ways and different <UNK> in life <UNK> just had to go get out your <UNK> burn her at the stake she's going back to weird town and all that jazz so much for <UNK> rights unfortunately lola just became nothing more of another <UNK> clone in all its <UNK> glory probably so as to not <UNK> her mistress br br but hey the 2000 generation of <UNK> <UNK> seem to love it with the chase <UNK> typical fairytale romance the tension between <UNK> hot logan and kick ass <UNK> or dana <UNK> to your liking and the pretty people please this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism they prefer a pretentious shallow and vapid lifestyle sorry to break it to you <UNK> that will not happen unless you have a major trust <UNK> and parents to <UNK> you
<START> this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and i stopped caring this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex there's a <UNK> and a <UNK> put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports br br sounds promising br br not really br br i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film basically i started not watching which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up br br it may work for you it didn't for me
<START> i ran across <UNK> in a film at the los angeles film festival and thought she was a doll after writing my review of her film there i wanted to see more of her found this movie it was pretty bad not her fault she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie bad directing scenes are <UNK> over and over with all the actresses <UNK> smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good i really like <UNK> but this was obviously a bad choice of hers i can't believe i rented this trash to look for her i hope to find her other movies
<START> when you think of golf movies you think of <UNK> but what if there are kids around go right to this movie disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy the acting in this movie in my opinion is quite good and the leading cast for the most part is very young this movie is also filmed very well and unique seeing all the angles of the golf game i think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch though the ending might be a little predictable the movie does well on its own it also shows that you do not need swearing nudity or violence to make a great golf movie
<START> adventures in dinosaur city though a creative idea was a <UNK> atrocious attempt at filmmaking being sucked into a tv and into a new world is interesting three teens <UNK> enthralled with half animated dinosaurs is not don't waste the time or the brain power to see this sure loser i wouldn't even let my kids watch it
<START> after 2 years of using this site for movie reviews i finally <UNK> with imdb just so i could give <UNK> a 10 the show's writers cast and crew have <UNK> themselves the <UNK> masters of the science fiction genre even those who do not normally appreciate sci fi should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance br br virtues are simply too numerous to list but one of them stands out above all the quality of the writing is amazing i haven't heard dialogue this good since <UNK> 7 in fact <UNK> feels a lot like a <UNK> 7 with good special effects and a bit more romance br br everyone enjoy
<START> this film was very interesting to me virtually a film within a film which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly <UNK> an actress and and actor who happen to dislike each other in producing sexual chemistry on film the director is faced with a of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film sex is comedy is much more than a comedy packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also <UNK> the psychological and <UNK> <UNK> behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex i loved this film the character <UNK> played by the beautiful anne performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art
<START> the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements it starts off with some <UNK> who get attacked and we see a bit of blood but that's the only blood in the entire film br br the evil below isn't the worst around but for a horror film it is <UNK> boring the acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads there's a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didn't know what to do i <UNK> to sit through it all just about but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone horror fans might want a copy for the cool vhs cover but it's best left at that
<START> mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere at what looks like a wooden building in the desert a pick up truck pulls up an angry father <UNK> his <UNK> daughter virginia monroe <UNK> christian out leaves her there but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of <UNK> <UNK> james watches her from a short distance virginia tries to make conversation but as she <UNK> a cigarette out under her <UNK> print <UNK> high high <UNK> boots <UNK> grabs her by her throat drags her off into the darkness <UNK> then rips her top open turns into a monster starts to eat her <UNK> virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have lieutenant <UNK> <UNK> art evans the <UNK> <UNK> or at least that's the message a local tv news reporter named clay mark thomas miller is telling his viewers clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend alice mary beth <UNK> therefore his mother emily <UNK> bates has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the <UNK> dark <UNK> wearing <UNK> unfortunately for emily she accidentally knocks <UNK> off which reveal he has strange <UNK> eyes <UNK> then turns into a monster again bites emily turning her into a flesh eating monster just like himself <UNK> takes emily out to train her they find a suitable homeless bum <UNK> murder him eat his guts but <UNK> son clay has witnessed the whole thing he must choose between doing what is right his love for his mother who now just happens to be a grotesque <UNK> flesh eating monster br br edited written directed by patrick <UNK> i thought mom was a pretty awful film looking at some of the other comments on the imdb the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that mom is a comedy horror well i can tell you now that i didn't see any comedic elements in mom at all because there aren't any unless they are very subtle the only thing that i can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which mom presents that being an old lady turning into a flesh eating monster the predictable problems emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out there are no jokes apart from <UNK> a prostitute beverly hills stella stevens slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself as far as i could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time so with there being no comedy in mom that must mean there's lots of horror right wrong mom sucks is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of <UNK> turning into a monster a couple of times biting emily showing her how to hunt for food clay finding out until this point mom was moving at a fairly decent pace had some ok special make up effects had me interested unfortunately mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by <UNK> son the eventual breakdown of his marriage him being torn between love for his mother the fact that she's a flesh eating monster this part of the film is incredibly slow boring as dull as <UNK> even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role <UNK> scenario where clay tells his mom to go to her room stay there <UNK> the door behind her telling her off putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins <UNK> us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should no matter how silly an explanation might have been i think some background to the monster would have helped technically mom is bland cheap looking although i can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly <UNK> or anything with which i could make fun of to pass the time the special make up on the monster are ok but their used in very quick flashes blink you'll miss them don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like i was the monster is only in it three times maximum all of those are within the <UNK> first thirty minutes there isn't much gore either a severed arm some brief <UNK> eating a burnt body a <UNK> in someone's arm is all we get the acting is ok but please mr <UNK> james what is that dodgy accent all about at least james had the good sense to know he was in crap <UNK> <UNK> to be killed off early on in the proceedings everyone else are <UNK> expect the black lieutenant who was also a black police officer in fright night 1985 but you may <UNK> him from die hard 2 1990 he made mom die hard 2 in the same year talk about opposite ends of the spectrum overall there is nothing by which i can really recommend mom as a horror film it certainly isn't a comedy as far as i'm concerned very poor very disappointing yet again i've been <UNK> by fancy video box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters definitely one to avoid
<START> it starts really interesting the story develops around the main character who runs a cleaning business <UNK> in cleaning up crime scenes as a former cop he runs into some strange situation when one job does suddenly <UNK> furthermore he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption his columbo feeling is justified the deeper he gets into the background of the story the good actors jackson ed harris eva <UNK> play in an suspenseful story with some twists but only up to the last 25 minutes up to here 7 of 10 stars spoiler suddenly the movie <UNK> its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shoot out involving the 14 year old daughter a betrayal of friendship and a not justified <UNK> out of the character development why not having giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship or having the daughter discovering some facts or many possible much better story finishes are imaginable a truly wasted ending
<START> we sat through this movie thinking why is this or that scene in the movie what does this have to do with the plot we hoped that by the end everything would be slightly more clear it was not to be br br i think the director in a fit of <UNK> threw the script up in the air and then some minor and vengeful <UNK> <UNK> it randomly with no regard to the scene being filmed possibly with <UNK> and <UNK> stick br br the film's <UNK> include communism bad <UNK> bad poor <UNK> bad <UNK> bad tv bad coherent scripting bad good it's really not clear br br finally no german water taxi would ever have an <UNK> <UNK> that would let passengers fall in to the water the <UNK> <UNK> of signs everywhere is testament to this fact
<START> i heard the stories of the <UNK> in the movie and thats great but that is only 1 100 of the movie the problem with this movie is the cheesiness i never really got the plot or why the guy was stealing girls that makes no sense but hey why they were in a club randomly was curious also many parts of this movie make no sense but overall i was interested it was confusing on many levels maybe i am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the b looking end scene they ran out of money just cut some stuff in and forgot about the plot its low budget and appears so i like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad but they used none that were quality i would say this film is the quintessential bad script with alright production it is definitely not as random as many movies i have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together in effects i would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950's on my ass sparks out of models and the like watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie mystery science theater has a candidate
<START> coming from oz i probably shouldn't say it but i find a lot of the local movies lacking that cohesive flow with a weak storyline this comedy lacks in nothing great story no overacting no melodrama just brilliant comedy as we know oz can do it do yourself a favour and laugh till you drop
<START> i remember watching this movie many years ago on vhs at a friends place at first i thought it would be a boring car movie but much to my surprise it ended up being one of the best movies i can remember watching for its time br br it has a good story line and best of all it has some awesome aussie cars and street racing i really loved <UNK> car the most which was a worked dodge <UNK> the paint work which was done on this car was truly outstanding in my opinion br br there's also a black two door blown <UNK> which comes into the movie later on br br i actually managed to get a copy of this movie on vhs last year at k mart over here in australia i did have plans of <UNK> this movie to dvd myself as i believe it is a movie worth the <UNK> but much to my surprise this weekend while i was <UNK> the dvd movie bin i came across it on dvd so of course i grabbed it while i could as it was the only copy there br br anyway if you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars including a great story line without a rice <UNK> in sight then this movie is for you br br here is some additional info taken from the back of the dvd br br he'll win at any cost fox is a young man that lives in the fast lane he believes he is the <UNK> man on the road but street racing is illegal if he doesn't accept his latest challenge he could loose his girl if he does accept he could lose his life living dangerously living fast and winning at any cost is their obsession they don't turn back the don't give in and the don't ask for help
<START> i just saw this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening i work for an independent theatre chain in <UNK> it's one of the <UNK> i'm sorry but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i know that there are some bruce campbell fanatics out there who like star wars die <UNK> will string you up from the nearest tree if you dare speak any ill of their beloved cinematic icon nevertheless campbell this particular work from the <UNK> is a celluloid black hole br br before you make any <UNK> that i'm some <UNK> <UNK> film buff who only watches real movies like ladies in <UNK> and <UNK> think again i'm a huge fan of b movies and bruce campbell in particular his trademark character ash is one of my favorites and his portrayal of the aging elvis in <UNK> ho <UNK> was phenomenal br br but hey b movies still have the potential to be bad and not in that good campy way we all love and that's what watching this particular one was like for me and my fellow co workers with the exception of that one tracking shot where bruce runs through the square and scares the kids there were no laughs to be had overall we found the story to be mind numbingly <UNK> the pacing like and the so called humor dumber than a bag of <UNK> i'm sorry but ted <UNK> character was not comic relief he was just plain retarded believe me we all went into this really wanting to like it but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours br br if you absolutely loved this movie plan to see it multiple times want to marry and have kids with it etc that's fantastic we all like what we like so you get no judgement from me but don't go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who aren't having multiple <UNK> over <UNK> latest cinematic <UNK> this flick was a steaming turd <UNK> in my humble opinion and as a true campbell fan i'm allowed to say that
<START> coming at the end of the cycle of the universal monsters horror films and before the golden age of sci fi films house of dracula is more science fiction than horror and <UNK> some of the more cheesy read enjoyable elements which would come to the sci fi films of the coming era <UNK> <UNK> jr plays the wolf man and john carradine dracula and glenn strange the frankenstein monster br br a mad scientist sets out to cure both monsters of their by means of modern read mad science when the <UNK> beautiful nurse assistant is revealed to be a <UNK> early in the film the viewer is thereby <UNK> to the fact this film is not going to be typical universal fare this film <UNK> the kind of sleazy exploitation we would come to take for granted in 1950's sci fi br br if you don't mind the slower pacing of the older films and black white does not throw you off this film is recommended viewing this one is not currently available on dvd but <UNK> <UNK> it occasionally so keep a <UNK> or you could always <UNK> it on your <UNK>
<START> i saw <UNK> gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing <UNK> long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece the <UNK> the reviews came in and critics <UNK> the film with an influential new york film critic led the way and most critics followed suit and the 40 min film was pulled from distribution united artists had <UNK> <UNK> the film by about an hour and it was re released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business the film at that time cost about 40 million dollars now considered low budget making it one of the most expensive in history and <UNK> had free <UNK> on the project with endless <UNK> despite it being only his third film the <UNK> had also received a negative <UNK> based on a perceived political ideology which was not popular i mention all this to present a possible bias building up against <UNK> at the time i thought the film was very good and when i saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so the film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990's they were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print nevertheless seeing the film years later i now thought <UNK> gate was a masterpiece finally the long version started to appear in a few <UNK> cities i got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait <UNK> gate begins with the <UNK> ceremony at <UNK> university two of the <UNK> are kris kristofferson and john hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on despite the <UNK> joseph <UNK> gives in his speech to the <UNK> class to use their education to <UNK> and improve their country many of the <UNK> behave as if they are part of an elite country club the film flashes ahead 20 years to johnson county in <UNK> a cattle company called the <UNK> association has hired poor people to shoot <UNK> poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves kristofferson sides with the immigrants while john hurt is part of the association although hurt is totally against this insane action he is too <UNK> a character to do anything about it a massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves a united states <UNK> comes to the rescue of the association to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they <UNK> the mass killing kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his <UNK> days married bored on a <UNK> living but dead on the inside br br this is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as it's themes structure direction cinematography writing music editing set designs and acting kristofferson walken hurt <UNK> <UNK> bridges <UNK> and <UNK> are all excellent portraying very complex characters some of the major complaints i read about this film state that is ugly to look at incoherent too long that the characters make no sense and that the words are often <UNK> in its defense <UNK> gate has the look of photographs of that period just as <UNK> mrs miller did some of the scenes are <UNK> looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses <UNK> people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of reality the critic who called it one of the <UNK> movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot but in spite of all that the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable the film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes as to its length it is a beautifully structured piece at times moving poetic <UNK> or devastating with virtually one great scene following another at times some of the words are <UNK> especially in some of the scenes <UNK> with activity but one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language the <UNK> between characters or their actions one day soon this film should be re released in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance do not let michael <UNK> become another orson welles under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the kinds of great films he is capable of making
<START> first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire we both thought it was a top film then watched sub 11 then sub <UNK> now i find there is sub which i cannot wait to get my <UNK> on and also there is a fifth in the <UNK> line if no one has seen the movies these are the best of the best i think it a thousands <UNK> i could watch these from morning to night i would love to have a set of nails like he has watch out girls i love it as all the story lines continues from film to film these <UNK> typical vampire movies they are better i would love to live in the life that is in the films it would make all my dreams come true
<START> this film is totally unbelievable the only way a girl would perform this act on a dog is if she had serious mental health issues or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under <UNK> yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise <UNK> healthy female just got a bit bored and <UNK> a little <UNK> and <UNK> had a sexual encounter with a dog what's more it never had any <UNK> affect on her ever again except when she tells someone br br not she was raped by a dog or the dog did something she couldn't resist she <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choice she wasn't on drugs or anything she just like <UNK> br br the rest of the film seeks to put this action in a light of <UNK> it could happen to anyone she's only being <UNK> br br but really for this to be believed we have to believe that this is a woman who is capable of doing absolutely anything if she <UNK> feels like <UNK> think about it could she have considered the rights and <UNK> of this action before carrying it out if she had she would have stopped in her tracks human beings have <UNK> boundaries for reasons if we are now to start considering <UNK> as a <UNK> little <UNK> what is next child abuse yet the <UNK> is portrayed as a hard done by nice girl who had one moment of <UNK> if she had been forced to carry out this act by an <UNK> the story might have made more sense and i would have been able to accept the storyline but there is no way that anyone carries out the prolonged activity required and referred to even once if there is not some deep <UNK> that requires a great deal of psychiatric help this is no way a one off happening in an otherwise perfect life br br i know this is just a film but it is through behaviour such as this via the media that society becomes and more and more awful realities become possible br br i could imagine an <UNK> showing this to a child to <UNK> them that it isn't such a big deal and then moving on with their agenda it could also be used by an <UNK> to <UNK> to a child not to tell about the abuse because look how people will react to you if you do br br this is not about truth the director wants people to think it's about truth this is about <UNK> and how easily people the viewing public can be manipulated into accepting the most appalling concepts if wrapped up in the right way the watching public are being manipulated <UNK> and laughed at br br this is a film in which the actors and the viewers are being <UNK> and made fools of in a very sophisticated way by a clever but extremely disturbed film writer br br this film appears to me to be being used as a vehicle for the creator of the film to get off on the excitement of playing with your mind in an abusive manner i don't know whether it is conscious on their part but it is the most classic example of mind f k that i have ever encountered br br i hope that this doesn't offend anyone too much but if you watched this film i don't think there is any room left to be offended by anything any more
<START> i caught this film under the title of what lies above on lifetime movie network last night and just had to comment on it designed as a <UNK> woman in peril action adventure yarn it is so unintentionally funny thanks in large part to marc <UNK> scenery chewing hammy performance that i thought i was watching a cross between cliffhanger and home alone 5 heroine nicole <UNK> makes her <UNK> but dumb as dirt male <UNK> look like the three stooges <UNK> to her ridiculous <UNK> <UNK> traps somehow she manages to <UNK> a swinging <UNK> ram with rope and a <UNK> in a matter of minutes which <UNK> takes out one of the <UNK> who want to kill her worth watching for a <UNK> laugh
<START> this is most likely the best picture not many will see it presented a culture in a real way a must see for all who like indie and for those who don't i think this movie will draw more into the indie scene the acting was top notch the character of alice was so well with perfect this movie be brought to the mainstream i think it would do alice is the most real look at an element of our culture that i have seen since go ask alice a look that is <UNK> by the hollywood hand movies like this show young people that these things aren't glamorous but that they are real and compelling if you liked pieces of april you will love this one
<START> ok i am really into king's stuff but this is just dreadful the whole movie i am waiting for the main character to do something profound with his new youth and power i can tolerate the worst of movies as anything is better than watching a cut movie with commercials in it but this takes the cake i gave it a 2 and i would never recommend it to anyone
<START> god cuts himself with a straight razor afterwards he gives birth to mother earth which then gives birth through gods <UNK> son of earth br br this is a one and a half an hour movie that sort of depicts a dark version of how god created the world its surreal dark and poetic the most important aspect of the film to me is the visuals its shot in a very grainy black and white film using both slow motion and normal shooting sometimes even fast film and stop motion the scenes are long and dragged out that sets a very weird mood no sounds were recorded when filming i think sound effects were added afterwards such as water and other <UNK> sounds repeated over and over as you might understand this movie is certainly not for the <UNK> person br br i often felt it was similar to david lynch's <UNK> only this one is even harder to understand and even more dragged out but that's okay for me i like that kind of stuff its certainly not entertainment at least not the hollywood kind so if your going to check it out i recommend you set yourself up for it be open minded and except something like the end of 2001 a space odyssey
<START> found this film for one dollar 1 00 and the film was a complete waste of time <UNK> brown mark <UNK> played a military <UNK> in south america and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense <UNK> however mark joins the opposite side after some horrible <UNK> were inflicted or women and men in one scene as mark is having a drink in a hotel bar his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs sandra spencer shannon <UNK> dead sexy <UNK> mark and sandra have the extreme <UNK> for each other and even make passionate love on some very hard rocks with no time for the <UNK> of a bed this is a horrible film and not worth wasting the time to even look at it
<START> this was a <UNK> mash of a film that started out going nowhere got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is finally introduced there were so many ugly <UNK> chopped guys in this film i lost track of who was the owner and who were the i have a theory about the casting though all the bad guys were played by ugly actors and one ugly actress and all the good guys victims were played by beautiful actors indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims the slaves were gorgeous as was the innocent <UNK> daughter while the plantation owner his mistress and his were pretty hard on the eyes on purpose you make the call br br i hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well if you just want to look at bare breasts there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave master fetish then you'll love this film otherwise watch it once vomit shower and never speak of it to anyone
<START> this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward attended by two the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over saying that the are gay the kiss i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny  it said on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience <UNK> with laughter because it is so funny  and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn't this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn't br br brilliant brains can make anything funny people like <UNK> lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the i suppose director and co scriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those <UNK> he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two are gay and kiss over a man in a coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy can't not for me anyway br br the main problem i have with this movie is that i can't see a reason behind the way the main characters behave i could not understand why the two brothers one an <UNK> jew from west germany one a third class <UNK> copy of fast eddie from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships  if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the <UNK> could not come up with anything better br br the acting is not bad <UNK> i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex <UNK> <UNK> a lighter version than of a <UNK> <UNK> jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the <UNK> to someone else now i heard he did a comedy about hitler <UNK>
<START> when the episode was made and aired <UNK> was president kennedy was president <UNK> br br as for the episode it was a passable episode if not a bit earnest the professor shows not much range here and the whole thing seems a little rushed a lot of episodes of the <UNK> seem to not fit the time <UNK> some seeming like they're <UNK> in and rushed some with little or nothing to it spread out over the half hour and some of course fit i guess you just expect a little more tension than to be taken back to some rooms and drugged but overall a decent episode indeed the what if <UNK> of time travel is a <UNK> in itself and sets the table of with basic interest br br 7 out of 10 considering there were a lot of <UNK> episodes not quite as good and some a great deal better
<START> i watched the mst3k version of the movie and this review includes minor spoilers br br when i started watching this movie it looked like it might have promise as a cheesy sci fi flick but the more i watched it the more disappointing it got the first reason is pretty <UNK> i liked the <UNK> shy girl with glasses a lot more than the model <UNK> became by the end of the movie more deeply it was the fact that the loss of glasses and change in clothing replaced any actual character growth instead of growing into a character that could take care of herself <UNK> was just as <UNK> on males to do everything for her as she was at the start of the movie the acting could have been better though i got tired of cracks about <UNK> voice they were even in the movie itself it's not that bad the background was okay but it was a little hokey aliens humans with and could have used more explanation br br maybe it was just that i was interested in the movie itself but joel and the <UNK> did little for me the movie might have been better without them at all br br overall for the movie itself not the mst3k a 3 out of 10 it was an okay flick for what it was
<START> ok yes its bad yes its complete fluff yes it makes the <UNK> look like an oscar winner but look at it like i did i was 13 special effects were pretty much non in 90 of films back in the good <UNK> days when films needed a story line ok so even the storyline is a bit dodgy but wow did i get into this film as a kid in the 80s cheesy rock bad special effects but <UNK> an <UNK> fights and it had queens one vision on the soundtrack see even the worst things have a silver <UNK> all in all if you want a bad film to show a 12 year old who hates computer effects if there is such a film this is the ideal choice
<START> usually when i don't see a show on an original run i find it later on cable and realize it's a gem the <UNK> girls is one of those rare exceptions i'm glad i missed it br br i truly despise shows that fill every minute of the actors space with rambling stupid boring banter this is one hour of just that the mother made me wonder if she is <UNK> and off her <UNK> she never stopped talking every minute every second talking to every person she <UNK> with worse yet her speech is childish and <UNK> like valley girl she talked about guys her hair her mother her clothes like what's the for situation i've watched this show three times and still don't get the point of this series it's not a comedy it's not a drama it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the girls from planet mars the males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable if ever existed and attempted to <UNK> onto me with conversation i'd have to <UNK> her to get rid of her she obviously doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else she also doesn't know how to really notice the existence of others br br in one show comes home from a date close to 10 <UNK> she got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an <UNK> she goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went she <UNK> on about how boring the guy was her date somehow got a few words in complained about how the man didn't stop talking choke hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was br br one other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality even dresses like her kid this obviously 40 something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in <UNK> br br i thought that this show should have been followed by just shoot me because that's exactly how i felt
<START> <UNK> now francis ford <UNK> war <UNK> is probably the most beautiful war film i have ever seen capt benjamin <UNK> martin sheen is a vietnam soldier who is <UNK> to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into cambodia to the of <UNK> <UNK> marlon brando a highly <UNK> and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and <UNK> from the army setting up his own little society and helped by a <UNK> following of soldiers <UNK> him up the river to cambodia is a handful of navy men and along the way they encounter several interesting people most notably is robert <UNK> a <UNK> lieutenant colonel with a few <UNK> loose and some horrifying situations br br is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study it is more <UNK> metal <UNK> than the running time of is over three hours but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived i was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed the beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me however after seeing this film i am convinced that coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history the <UNK> films were all <UNK> with an almost <UNK> tone and shadows created the feeling of a <UNK> composition with there is an incredible usage of natural light and the shadows particularly in the scenes involving brando and sheen almost become a living character they are so <UNK> and effective another gorgeous scene was when <UNK> <UNK> and jay <UNK> <UNK> forrest were in the jungle looking for <UNK> and come across a tiger the sheer <UNK> of the surrounding <UNK> leaves as big as a house made the characters almost but the <UNK> of the scene was incredible while everything else was almost a muted grey the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green an effect that was particularly striking another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the <UNK> carrying duvall and company attack the small village while playing wagner this could have just been an ultra dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene but instead coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene with duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to the hell out of <UNK> br br the performances in are first class much has been made of the amount of money brando earned for the film and the amount of trouble he caused regardless of this he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time sheen is completely outstanding this is the first time i have seen him really <UNK> in a film  and duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony <UNK> <UNK> is a film that is so <UNK> in pop culture by now most know several choice lines from the film 'i love the smell of <UNK> in the <UNK> et al but i knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience i have not seen the original cut of <UNK> <UNK> so i cannot compare it to this newer cut but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced 8 10 br br <UNK>
<START> i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in 1991 i was 12 then and <UNK> <UNK> was my favorite actor and adolescent crush i am now 23 and i still love this movie the best part about it is whoever i am dating loves it too because it is a total macho guy movie it is <UNK> with enough action and mayhem to keep men with the <UNK> attention <UNK> glued to the screen i only wish that it was available on dvd
<START> bad bad bad how do movies like this get made badly written poorly acted i could go on but why bother as an aside note that the characters' first names are the same as the actors playing them this is a dead <UNK> that no one on the set is even interested enough in their role to bother learning someone else's characters names
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was the reason i decided to watch this film as neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film  which goes to show me and everyone that a dvd shouldn't be judged by it's cover br br spoilers the film felt like it was along not really going anywhere for the moment  the <UNK> of paul around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch and the <UNK> on the otherwise attractive kirsten <UNK> as <UNK> lee being too school <UNK> to watch where those really <UNK> in 1995 br br the relationship between <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and todd <UNK> jason london was <UNK> from the start of though that first meeting across the lake  magical what a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has <UNK> like a complete moron <UNK> with two as in in front of <UNK> a shame really that we as the audience knew who <UNK> <UNK> really was <UNK> the title did give that away wouldn't you think br br what really surprised me was the acting especially in the scene where <UNK> gives todd a metal version of his alter ego the dog character in the little white <UNK> box the actors really managed to recreate that <UNK> sensation of a first kiss  point of no return for todd and <UNK> a shame really that the film ends with focus on after getting over <UNK> fathers <UNK> drive his re <UNK> with his friends i could <UNK> a whole new film  following <UNK> to new york  there must be a good art university there that todd could attend br br nevertheless a film that does just what we want hollywood to entertain us for the duration of the film did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film <UNK> mother is slightly insane on the phone 24 7 his dad doesn't find her attractive any more <UNK> teacher obviously is <UNK> by his wife and vice versa  todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic daring relationship which however nice it may be would realistically be very difficult to maintain age difference maturity difference etc and <UNK> do not get together because <UNK> is not mature enough to handle a relationship her reactions towards the <UNK> the cheating <UNK> advances etc are all very immature and often involve running away and himself the poor guy  is too much of a best friend like a brother guy to pull even <UNK> br br mind you good film though i gave it an 8 10 brilliant performance by the actors who bring the script to life
<START> the three main characters are all hopeless and yet you only feel sorry for one of them <UNK> hopelessly devoted to <UNK> this was part of the frustration screaming at <UNK> to get a clue and <UNK> the no good harry to no <UNK> br br then there's the satisfaction steve <UNK> has a great part as a <UNK> and harvey <UNK> moving story of his <UNK> playing a gorilla for a cheap tv movie is incredible when you least expect it quentin <UNK> is doing half a monologue and anthony quinn turns <UNK> into a wealthy man br br time and again great moments appear in the story but in the end it's hard to know what to feel about this movie it doesn't have a happy ending or even a complete one but it somehow feels right br br this movie is strange but then so am i no wonder i liked it
<START> a few minutes in not credible what idiot wrote this br br but what's going on who's the bad guy then there's that rebecca de time passes br br the end br br not credible what idiot actually watched the whole thing
<START> always enjoy the classic horror films however this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for john carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments this film was made during <UNK> ii and john carradine was a german nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world bob steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film <UNK> <UNK> jeff gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention i hate to criticize a film made in 1943 but this is really a big disappointment if you like john carradine and the roles he played as count dracula throughout many films during the 1940's you just might like to watch john doing his best
<START> i've seen some terrible book to film adaptations in my day but this one tops them all the <UNK> unattractive cast <UNK> from the story which is in itself untrue to the book mr is nothing like handsome as for catherine <UNK> a rat like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience <UNK> is nothing like the <UNK> one reads about in the original text and james <UNK> appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story also as others have pointed out before this novel was intended to <UNK> the gothic <UNK> prevalent in <UNK> time but it appears that this soft horror film was designed and meant to be taken seriously i'm sure jane austen turns over in her grave each time one of her fans is disappointed by this awful interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke
<START> i would put death wish 3 in the same box as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the box that i would sell for 2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside the story is about the main character coming back from the previous <UNK> success to ruin it all with this load of trash why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk the story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel i mentioned <UNK> earlier because it has the same mood that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch both this movie and <UNK> were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get <UNK> down by gang members firing <UNK> from their <UNK> this movie was so bad i thought for a minute it was death wish 4
<START> i rate movies on this site all the time but i don't normally write comments however in this case i felt compelled to warn others this movie is bad it's probably one of only a dozen movies i have scored as <UNK> awful ' i know people say this all the time but this truly was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it's easily on the bottom ten anyway br br when it comes to horror movies i have very low standards i'll overlook all sorts of shoddy film making for a good scare but this movie is embarrassingly bad it looks someone bought a video camera at <UNK> and decided to make a movie with his buddies the fact that every single crew <UNK> name appears in the cast list proves this theory i think this movie has lower production standards than your average high school play it's actually a little shocking to see a movie that looks this bad released on dvd the special effects are somewhat effective at times but are still amateurish at best the best thing that can be said about the actors is that at least they remember no to look into the camera most of the time i can't say for certain if they struggling to remember their lines or making them up as they went along any and all attempts at humor are lame this movie is such a <UNK> waste of time
<START> and abysmal over the top acting you might enjoy this rubbish flick apparently atomic bombs makes life <UNK> in about a day or two or according to other viewers wake them up or so it seems and apparently massive atomic explosions off the coast of spain doesn't make anyone ask any questions at all coming to think of it the plot doesn't make sense in any way whatsoever why would evil <UNK> puppets attack so the <UNK> going off for no reason at all doesn't stand out too much br br ok getting past this and the fact that the monster is a <UNK> thing you make of <UNK> in <UNK> you may actually be able to stand this but for once the complete lack of gore doesn't help leaving the monster attacks in all their naked rock bottom budget glory br br i doubt you'll be able to watch this though so better stay well away
<START> this is the best movie i've ever seen and i've seen a lot i'm not even a troma fan i've never heard of troma before watching this movie br br i had already given up hope to see a great movie until i saw <UNK> and juliet this movie is a dream coming true shakespeare would likely be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic there are sex violence humor and satire it breaks many <UNK> br br this movie is neither disgusting nor stupid it's hard to describe with words how clever funny exciting and witty this movie is the music is great and perfectly fits every scene the characters are very believable and the acting is great i really cared for the characters br br it is certainly not for <UNK> fans only it's for all people who have a sense of humor and like clever and believable entertainment as opposed to totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that don't dare to do what this movie does br br the bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something exceptional you either love it or hate it like all true works of art it isn't understood and appreciated by all people
<START> in the only act of <UNK> they have ever made the film television office refused to <UNK> this film the producers kicked up a big stink in a <UNK> of publicity took their production to victoria apart from the lost work for <UNK> were lucky not to have been involved br br the film fails on just about every level the post <UNK> fails the casting fails what is rose <UNK> character all about which 1 dimensional <UNK> nasty did hugo <UNK> channel what the hell is pia <UNK> character doing and the story is a clichéd mess of <UNK> in fact the story runs like a dragged out <UNK> rather than a complete plot line br br it might have had a chance if the pop culture meets depression style was better thought out and executed if the casting was <UNK> if the style was less serious if just about everything was different br br apart from the usual excellence in costume design cinematography like most australian films the film is just a total <UNK> br br at a reported budget in excess of the tender hook is a <UNK> of the <UNK> of the australian film industry the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting <UNK> compare this mess with noise under or <UNK> boys under and you get the idea the tough interesting films are struggling for funding and the <UNK> overblown projects with name casts are getting the bucks br br the funding bodies who invested in this deserve to go the same way as hugo <UNK> character at the end of the film
<START> i was expecting a lot more of this film than what i actually got the acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive it took a lot of something i don't to even follow what was going because it was so <UNK> an example of the acting is when <UNK> character is upset the south <UNK> colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the sand map it was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic to make things worse i have no idea how i'm supposed to feel about he's obviously presented as the protagonist but as soon as he gets to vietnam he starts an affair with an <UNK> english teacher the only thing the movie had going for it was that it wasn't particularly boring i give it 4 stars out of 10
<START> <UNK> le <UNK> played by charles boyer is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe and to stay free he holes himself up in the a mysterious part of <UNK> where even the police are reluctant to go until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le <UNK> once and for all for le <UNK> although the allows him to remain out of police custody it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time a place he can't leave because the moment he does he knows he'll be arrested br br <UNK> performance was good and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar he captures the essence of such a character a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time the movie itself unfortunately was quite a letdown a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent of which i'll mention two first was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the fairly regularly so neither the suggestion by <UNK> that the police wouldn't enter nor the statement by inspector also a decent performance by joseph <UNK> that they could get into the but not out seemed to make much sense i also found it difficult to believe that le <UNK> hardened criminal mastermind that he was could be so quickly swept off his feet by <UNK> hedy <UNK> to the point where he entertains the local <UNK> by singing love songs and then leaves the to find her essentially giving himself up i understand the irony of the final few scenes of course as <UNK> leaves the freedom of his prison the only to find real freedom in his capture because he's shot and killed by the police i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le <UNK> would fall into such a trap br br this is worth watching for boyer and to a lesser extent <UNK> but the story is disappointing and inconsistent 3 10
<START> i just wanted to say that when i was young my favorite t v show back in the day was night heat i loved the characters and the plot of the show i thought that it was an excellent show and still do to this day i enjoy watching the reruns and i am a big fan i love the way the characters played off one another i would always stay up late to watch my favorite show with my mother who also was a big fan now i can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the theme song which i thought was a cool song for the show my favorite characters were scott <UNK> and jeff <UNK> i enjoyed watching these handsome guys take down the bad boys
<START> gary busey is superb in this musical biography great singing and excellent soundtrack the buddy holly story is a much better movie than la <UNK> from reading other comments there may be some historical inaccuracies regardless it is a fun toe <UNK> film and a good introduction to buddy <UNK> music
<START> i had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing but i just found it annoying it's been a while since i've seen it and hopefully i won't find out all my memories are wrong and i'm <UNK> <UNK> this movie but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray leopold and <UNK> as <UNK> by an anti gay society and that this somehow caused their horrible crime i totally disagree with this point of view and think it's unfair both to <UNK> and to bobby <UNK> the real victim of the story i can't imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as <UNK> i also thought l l were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually were after all they were teenagers who lived at home the film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems like it should be scored by <UNK> br br i just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that implied the film's <UNK> such as the push button phones that characters used were meant to add <UNK> distance they certainly do that but i happened to find it highly <UNK> br br apparently a number of people found this movie interesting but i would have preferred a less stylish and more realistic examination of the part homosexuality may have played in the leopold <UNK> case
<START> very mildly <UNK> br br i must start by saying that i'm not usually impressed by science fiction so pitch black 2000 was a pleasant surprise it had me hooked from the very beginning with rhythm intensity and visual <UNK> that left me fascinated and glued to my seat i'm very happy to say that this movie was the best okay at least one of the best science fiction piece that i've seen in a long long time br br the plot in short might sound simple a space ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain caroline <UNK> impressive <UNK> mitchell must lead the survivors to safety at first a cold blooded murderer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who plays the role with very believable spare style might seem like the <UNK> biggest problem but as the <UNK> starts <UNK> in the creatures of the night start awakening this leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the <UNK> <UNK> which as we all can guess does not lead to a happy family <UNK> br br it's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching after all let's face it if you strip it down to the <UNK> it's not that original but the skill in which it's told the story <UNK> forward didn't leave me <UNK> at least not much in any point the directing was fabulous work this was a very visual even beautiful movie the purple night view was a real treat although <UNK> might not be the right word to use yes the images shown were candy to the eye but they also added a touch of <UNK> <UNK> as if something was just about to burst out from under the still surface not to mention that the monsters were really well done they looked realistic which seems to be rare nowadays maybe people just can't be bothered to make them look real br br i did not only enjoy the visual side of the movie but also the psychological aspect of the story during the movie we get to see the characters <UNK> some of them fall some of them rise but what fascinated me the most was the developing of the character of <UNK> i enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie to go even further the other thing i enjoyed a lot with <UNK> was the incredibly well and originally executed <UNK> sexual tension between <UNK> and him that didn't you'll get what i mean once you see it one can't deny that they had chemistry don't even try or i'll seek you out and make you listen to me playing <UNK> until you scream grin it was fresh as <UNK> mitchell once put it a <UNK> quote pitch black is a really sexy movie with no sex which is what makes it even more so interesting br br so to <UNK> i recommend this movie even if you're really not a fan of space stories the suspense was kept until the very end and what's important we were or at least i was left wanting for more if you can't be bothered to think about psychology subtext and such as is my bad habit you'll still find pitch black highly entertaining just kick off your shoes and enjoy
<START> i haven't seen <UNK> wars in years but i remember it as one of the most hilarious events of human experience and it was over far too soon every aspect of this movie was hilarious and it was even better than star wars i laughed i cried after watching it i asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just so i could kiss it goodbye i'm kidding about the last one i love it when ham sidekick co pilot tries to eat princess anne <UNK> hair <UNK> and the <UNK> character is just hilarious this film would be great to watch back to back with thumb wars and i sincerely wish there could have been a <UNK> wars episode ii the <UNK> strikes out was there
<START> this is by far the most vapid idiotic insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air and this is coming from someone who remembers san <UNK> beach <UNK> br br my wife loves watching reality shows and there was one episode of this drivel where the <UNK> had to develop a walk the end result was straight out of monty <UNK> <UNK> of silly walks sketch i couldn't laugh hard enough br br and then there's the <UNK> ms banks as in laughing all the way to the she has to be the most annoying self important woman on tv since <UNK> <UNK> left the view as if <UNK> was doing great things for mankind please i've never found her attractive and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the <UNK> to open her mouth br br someone needs to tell these human clothes <UNK> to eat a healthy <UNK> and actually look like real women
<START> the beautiful charming <UNK> versatile and talented irene dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of american cinema in over 21 as in all her films she lights up the screen with a natural yet glamorous presence she is simultaneously authentic and human and a charismatic inspirational model this role is quintessential irene dunne full of pathos and wit and a little <UNK> i love all of her films and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when tcm aired it last night i hope they don't wait years to air it again br br likewise charles coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all of american <UNK> true he often portrays variations on the same theme but i never tire of watching his soft hearted here his character is the perfect foil for irene dunne and he is portrayed perfectly by coburn their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic they never miss a beat in addition they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of irene <UNK> husband portrayed by alexander knox br br i am not as familiar with work he was recognizable but that was about all however cast with dunne and coburn he holds his own he delivers a fine nuanced performance his character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by performance and never held over us like some holy grail he is noble but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete his interaction with dunne is always convincing too dunne supports him without being <UNK> or becoming a <UNK> and he responds in kind their scenes are very well done br br the film itself is a fantastic <UNK> of a moment and a <UNK> not portrayed in other movies i don't recall off the top of my head another movie that portrays america still fighting wwii but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post war world not the usual wwii movie that in itself is interesting it is also essential to the plot and the movie's message in contrast to other <UNK> i thought that the climactic speech was okay but not great it was delivered very well by knox but it was not as tightly written as the build up led me to expect i have heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar themes it served its purpose br br for me the greater value of the movie was the depiction of the life of dunne and knox as it reflected the typical experience the sense of community among the wives living on <UNK> seemed absolutely authentic as did <UNK> itself despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage set the incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their husbands the <UNK> of the candidates <UNK> the difficult and complex material they had to learn the <UNK> base <UNK> obviously <UNK> constructed the tired and worn <UNK> the constant and <UNK> short <UNK> for returning to base for learning lessons for catching trains to subsequent <UNK> <UNK> constantly running into their predecessors and <UNK> in the base <UNK> as they were moving in and out yes i suspect this was a glimpse of a real wwii experience <UNK> in some comedy but very real at its core i loved it and i recommend it highly
<START> having read the book prior to watching this adaptation you would think that it would have lost some of its thrill however the story is so clever i could never tire of it br br sally and <UNK> really put their hearts into their roles and brought out so much of the characters i fell in love with the story and the women all over again br br beautiful to watch thanks to direction settings and despite the plot speed of television i don't feel that anything important was lost in <UNK> it had me on the edge of my seat throughout with lots of wonderful stomach <UNK> moments enjoyed it thoroughly this is the kind of television i have been waiting for
<START> it is not only difficult to comment <UNK> on the three parts of <UNK> trilogy it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite view them in order blue white and red and consider them together as one complete work it is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes liberty <UNK> <UNK> and each them is developed with unique <UNK> of intrigue and artistry they are each well worth seeing <UNK> but i believe they are best seen as one work <UNK> i would rate the trilogy as a 9 <UNK> i place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994 br br the color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a <UNK> ad the <UNK> model of which is the central of the movie's three main characters the other two characters do a double take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad posted larger than life alongside a busy city <UNK> this ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons i have called red a mind film this is the third of <UNK> three colors trilogy based on the blue white red of the french flag and the three parts of its <UNK> liberty <UNK> <UNK> ' the films stay primarily focused on these themes keeping with the basic levels of one two or three main characters yet with each film the complexity of plot <UNK> as the three principles move from <UNK> personal liberty blue to <UNK> white to social <UNK> red red is my favorite of these films and i give it a 9 it stands by itself as a great film but one should see blue and white first for the <UNK> effect
<START> is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged james robert kennedy <UNK> and the football coach from the t l <UNK> high school harold jones br br cuba gooding jr is excellent as radio i would never imagine to see him in a serious performance specially because most of the movies i watch with him are comedies ed harris is great as harold jones but this actor is great so this is not anything new br br the mentally challenged young man called james robert kennedy always walk around the t l <UNK> high school without bothering anyone and almost not noticed one day when the ball is throw near him he decides to stay with the ball for the <UNK> of johnny cash one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met one day cash decides to <UNK> james mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up br br when coach jones discovers that horrible act he stays angry and <UNK> all the team deciding for this day on to help james who gets the <UNK> because of his passion for <UNK> in general br br the movie shows how radio becomes an <UNK> assistant helping the team train despite <UNK> from the players and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city br br i would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story it has a life lesson specially showing us how a person can make a difference even not being what we call radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives
<START> this film is well cast often silly and always funny lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection brent <UNK> is just a riot as the <UNK> <UNK> of a cruise director from the first <UNK> <UNK> to the last you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two <UNK> i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy
<START> prime suspect 4 continues the exploits of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of truth and justice detective <UNK> jane the first of three miniseries with the notable absence of <UNK> writer <UNK> la <UNK> from the credits <UNK> with the same gritty reality of the first three series the second three series pit against the forces of evil while <UNK> with middle age loneliness <UNK> a host of personal and professional problems and <UNK> which are sometimes less than ideal <UNK> two stories while are single episodes each which find seeking justice on behalf of the brutally <UNK> while <UNK> war against <UNK> which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good in other words to <UNK> must overcome both evil and good forces something which makes the always gray scenarios of the ps series yet and the wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers very good stuff which only gets better from series to series b
<START> shirley <UNK> films for <UNK> century fox aren't <UNK> because they're poorly made <UNK> f <UNK> <UNK> most of them after all they don't retain much of a classic stature among cinema <UNK> mainly because they're <UNK> down with the <UNK> optimism of depression era hollywood 1930s audiences were by the delight of seeing a often <UNK> sunshine girl making the grown ups look foolish by comparison they <UNK> and <UNK> their hands while she <UNK> her troubles away seen these many years later <UNK> vehicles barely get by on story aided always by musical sequences to <UNK> the content and her timing always too perfect and exaggerated reactions might leave most modern viewers rolling their eyes no one could possibly be blamed for their <UNK> over <UNK> performance here shouting lines at the top of her <UNK> or the <UNK> of her dance steps with a crowd of sailors to at the <UNK> ball still the fantasy aspect of this particular story previously filmed in <UNK> from the book by laura e richard is enough to <UNK> those in the proper <UNK> spirit seems <UNK> was pulled from a <UNK> by a government <UNK> <UNK> keeper but when a <UNK> officer from the state board finds out the <UNK> isn't in school she threatens to take the kid away it doesn't really matter if the <UNK> faced officer has a point that temple isn't being raised properly the woman is turned into the proverbial <UNK> almost immediately one can see right away that temple can hold her own taking care of herself and her elderly guardian in the bargain as well as the local widow who has her <UNK> in for the captain temple isn't the only one overly <UNK> guy <UNK> january is <UNK> for wide eyed reactions so often you wonder if maybe if he didn't film them all in one day the dialogue is <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> you can't rush a <UNK> well don't give up the ship and something about the whole enterprise seems strangely <UNK> from
<START> thank you mario van <UNK> for <UNK> us of not only the existence of black <UNK> but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow br br the plot backdrop music and talent were all top notch it was great that you used so many african american artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy it was also good to see billy zane in this movie does he ever play a good guy br br i would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to <UNK> their way of thinking this is an excellent movie and i feel <UNK> to have seen it hopefully you'll feel the same
<START> while this isn't one of miss <UNK> very worst films it is pretty bad and it's sad that in a <UNK> fashion recent imdb <UNK> have deliberately over <UNK> the scores on some of her films to make up for her being <UNK> in the past or so it seems for years conventional wisdom has been that davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau william randolph <UNK> bought her way into hollywood this certainly is the image created in orson welles' citizen kane it is true that <UNK> did use his considerable wealth and <UNK> to build <UNK> career with all this money it's not surprising that she made some excellent films and it isn't surprising that people got <UNK> due to all the extra attention she got sleeping with the man who <UNK> your films is bound to get noticed however despite this edge she also made a decent number of bad films and i think we really need balance when it comes to the scores of her movies after all no rational person could believe that as of today 1 5 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> my heart and two other davies films recently shown on turner classic movies the girl and <UNK> deserved the exceptionally high scores <UNK> them higher than such films as high <UNK> ben <UNK> the best years of our lives and all quiet on the western front in fact <UNK> would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to imdb with a score of 8 8 considering most people out there don't even know who marion davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters this is a serious problem however she was a much better actress than citizen kane implied and initially broke into films before she began sleeping with <UNK> br br what sets <UNK> <UNK> my heart apart from these two other movies is that <UNK> and the girl were pleasant little films while <UNK> <UNK> my heart is in some ways just terrible much of the reason was the terrible <UNK> of marion while her french accent in <UNK> was cute in <UNK> her irish accent just sounded bizarre not particularly irish plus and perhaps i'm mistaken but her <UNK> use of the word <UNK> makes her sound like she should be doing shakespeare not a film set in 1933 ireland also there was a bizarre <UNK> that marion should be the <UNK> multi talented star so they had her not just act but dance and sing the singing actually fit the scripts in some of her films but here it seemed out of place and seriously <UNK> from the film it just seemed like you could almost hear <UNK> shouting out see she is a great actress look at her sing and dance sadly marion just looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes but for me the biggest problem was the idea of having <UNK> year old marion playing such a youthful role it was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be like the ones mary pickford played in the teens and <UNK> complete with the pig <UNK> and <UNK> attitude miss pickford could carry off these roles even though she too wasn't a girl any more but here marion had put on a bit of weight and looked at least 30 no offense she looked fine for her age but she did not look like a teen br br oddly with the millions that hearts spent on <UNK> career he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fit <UNK> talents believe me i have rated several of her films very high i especially adore show people but here she just couldn't help but flop this film was a turkey
<START> i loved this show i was waiting for it to come out on dvd it never has does anyone know how to get the show available on dvd i have <UNK> lifetime tv and a few others and nothing please let me know if there is a way we can have this series on dvd be first in line to purchase it i really got hooked on this show i do not understand how a bunch of other tv shows are available on dvd but not any day now i am sure there are many of us out there who would love to have this series on dvd or even vhs i thought of <UNK> the production company has anyone else out there tried to contact anyone for this information
<START> these kinda movies just don't get the credit they deserve this is my 2nd all time favorite movie stand by me being 1st the reason i watched this movie was because <UNK> <UNK> was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and i think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did sean <UNK> i just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me everything in the movie is very exceptional the script the acting the screenplay i was on the edge of my seat 80 of the time and if my mom wasn't in the room i would have absolutely <UNK> whenever joey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> died i did not see that coming at all i was real surprised when i heard that it wasn't real popular back in the 90's i was born a few years after it came out so of course i didn't go see it in the theaters but im sure i would have if i would have been alive if any of my friends watched this they would be like <UNK> okay but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this if you haven't seen this movie or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb this is the movie for you to watch
<START> filmed less than a year after the soviet <UNK> from afghanistan the subject matter was fresh in the minds of the cast the director and the audience most of the cast are actual soldiers and officers just back from the war the soviet army <UNK> quite a bit during filming which is odd br br the <UNK> <UNK> was a bloody and pointless war in which even the <UNK> had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed this film shows the tension and the cruelty of military life the emotional <UNK> experienced by the troops and the pain that <UNK> a small nation torn by war and civil war br br there is no lack of powerful scenes one of the first is footage of steel <UNK> being loaded onto a transport bound for the <UNK> <UNK> go about their work while an officer <UNK> <UNK> off the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> br br an earlier comment describes the last scene with as illogical it is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film the only human relationship <UNK> was with the <UNK> family which he accidentally kills in the assault having lost his only <UNK> against the <UNK> of the war turns his back on the boy and his gun in <UNK> to his fate br br i particularly liked the last scene a flock of <UNK> rising over the mountains as the voice of a pilot yells we're leaving boys we're leaving in a tone of sincere relief br br is an excellent film brutally honest and as as they come
<START> snakes on a train is a movie i rented due to the pure amusement of the thoughts i had about the movie snakes on a plane was an enjoyable action film so obviously the film makers wanted to cash in on the success with this low budget effort at 85 minutes snakes on a train is almost unbearable to witness i had to keep <UNK> the film to do something to entertain myself due to the lack of happenings in the film throughout the duration of the film it's never fully explained why this girl has this curse or why she keeps <UNK> up this green <UNK> goo constantly not only that there is endless boring dialog of the two main characters <UNK> and <UNK> discussing how to get rid of the curse i can appreciate low budget film making i'm truly not <UNK> on movies i'm open to any genre or budget but snakes on a train is truly one of the worst horror films i have ever seen were the writers on acid or something at the end of this film why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake and most importantly how on earth was it able to <UNK> the train br br bottom line snakes on a train is a movie that needs to be avoided at all costs don't be intrigued like i was by the title this is a movie that's seriously bad let's put these snakes to rest br br 0 10
<START> <UNK> is perhaps this movie its biggest problem the movie starts of as a fast stylish and just plain fun political satire but in its second <UNK> the movie gets more serious of tone in an almost oliver stone kind of way it's of course also a very serious subject but i would say that the movie would had been way better and also more effective if it had been completely done in the same style as the first <UNK> of the movie got shot in br br for a biography and a movie concerning the subject of this movie the movie is also quite short with its mere <UNK> minutes of running time the movie because of this feels like it isn't telling the whole story of course the following up of the events after the soviet <UNK> of afghanistan gets hinted at in the movie but the movie doesn't go deeper into it and it doesn't explain much about it which feels like a cheap way to just <UNK> charlie wilson without showing the other side of the <UNK> also the actual events in the movie itself gets rather <UNK> even though the story still gets told needlessly complex at times br br yes the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere the movie should had been for instance more like <UNK> the dog that achieved to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues br br because of this incoherent style and way of storytelling the acting performances are also mixed when tom hanks is playing his character more <UNK> and in a more comical kind of way he's just excellent but this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive shocking moments of the movie philip seymour hoffman is always excellent though as he is in any movie that he plays in he also received an oscar nomination for his role in this movie most of the other actors just seem to walk around in this movie just to be in the movie this goes mostly for julia roberts whose character i found just too mysterious to seem to have a clear enough purpose for the movie she made a redundant impression on me and is <UNK> also really forgettable in this movie br br it's not that the movie is a bad watch it actually is quite good and also enjoyable but if the movie would had <UNK> to be a bit more <UNK> the movie would had been a better and foremost also more effective one at what it tried to obviously achieve br br 7 10
<START> this movie includes one of the best characters and dialog that <UNK> glover has ever played uma thurman and <UNK> <UNK> are also great in this movie but <UNK> makes it a great depiction of young people trying to make it in new york
<START> well in all honesty it's beyond the boundaries of stupid but killer <UNK> is still one insanely entertaining little flick no plot tons of <UNK> up <UNK> cheesy effects and a penis eating monster what's not to love pretty much a couple of <UNK> find this creature that likes to itself within a woman's <UNK> <UNK> until a is unfortunately ah thrust into its mouth it finds it's host who is later discovered frozen in a deserted house by a group of moronic guys and their equally brainless slut girlfriends whose van breaks down the creature jumps from each girl as they all <UNK> like drunken <UNK> there's some cheap gore girl on girl blood wrestling <UNK> <UNK> vomit <UNK> puppet monsters and lots of soft core sex ridiculous but a cool waste of time
<START> love in <UNK> is my all time movie set in w a it is and has an excellent cast including a group of three gorgeous actors russell <UNK> as arthur back in the day when he actually looked hot with short hair and no facial hair <UNK> young barry and craig adams as ken <UNK> br br ken is a senior high school student obsessed with sex and becomes <UNK> for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates he starts a new job at his <UNK> clothing factory and becomes close with another new guy barry who buys a car so that they can go out and pick up chicks they become mates with the <UNK> geek arthur <UNK> and the three guys drive up to to a <UNK> and lose their virginity br br watch it its a classic for so long i have been trying to get a hold of a dvd or soundtrack anyone let me know if you've got em
<START> is a fine drama even though they're are some problems with the ending lauren <UNK> plays who is trying to avoid college to make her <UNK> mother not notice she makes up <UNK> that everybody thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote all the acting is first rate especially lauren <UNK> and amy <UNK> they both put in great performances the climax is also very powerful there are only two bad parts first is the character of stewart worthy played by christopher lloyd his part is underdeveloped the other weakness is the ending it goes around in circles which i didn't expect with the <UNK> min run time besides that the movie is definitely worth watching
<START> the <UNK> rule in the making of this film seems to have been never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene this was a principle set right from the start with an <UNK> long portrayal of the <UNK> of the <UNK> class of <UNK> the point of that scene i suppose was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background which is somewhat effective when comparing the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> ceremony to the realism of life in johnson county <UNK> but it just keeps going and going and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind numbing <UNK> made even worse by the fact that i found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent in the end i couldn't even watch this in one sitting i got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before i could drag myself back to see how it turned out br br my reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame because there are <UNK> here the performances are generally of a high <UNK> especially from kris as christopher walken as champion and isabelle <UNK> as ella the basic story interspersed as it is around that ever present mind numbing <UNK> is potentially interesting focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in johnson county and a local cattle <UNK> efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military there's also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots having said that the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time and should have been in the end all those potential <UNK> are washed out by again the mind numbing <UNK> that the movie seems to <UNK> around seriously 2 10
<START> apparently <UNK> heads was the last movie that <UNK> harris had a role in i have not seen all of his movies but <UNK> harris was in many good movies and i remember him best from live and let die where he played <UNK> <UNK> and which was full of voodoo references something that is common here in south florida i always thought live and let die was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and <UNK> unlike most of the <UNK> movies in <UNK> heads <UNK> harris is back in his voodoo persona he has a great style for mystery and the occult and his part in this movie is excellent sadly the rest of the movie is something of a comedy spoilers three kids who look like they were fired from the cast of the little <UNK> get killed by a neighborhood <UNK> who looks like he got fired from the cast of fame or as a dancer on dick <UNK> american <UNK> in other words these kids give low budget another dimension <UNK> harris goes to the <UNK> funeral home cuts off the three kids' heads and nobody notices and then takes them to his <UNK> unit where he has a giant <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> the three heads get tossed in along with some <UNK> <UNK> and voodoo items at some point mr harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he <UNK> his blood on them and they come to life as talking heads they can fly make jokes roll their eyes and exact vengeance from the evil <UNK> they usually look pretty funny flying around but the effects are not bad for some reason one of the kids always has a switch blade in his mouth and he uses it to slice people's <UNK> and to cut holes into <UNK> this movie is weird and funny but only the first time you see it meg foster is in this movie and she looks <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> and meg plays a <UNK> leader of the local gangsters strange movie
<START> over the <UNK> is a near failure of a debut feature and not because it's not without trying actually it is it's a <UNK> all the more because it's writer director technical <UNK> nick went through the same <UNK> cult that he depicts in the film sometimes a first time filmmaker full of the <UNK> that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students goes <UNK> into style that is way too disjointed unsure and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story the extremely personal side gets <UNK> in the purpose of telling a good story who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and <UNK> their patients with crazy group scare tactics psychological mind f sessions that could go on for days and attitudes from the <UNK> leaders that would make most nazis cringe escaped finally when he was 15 i'm glad he got out though it might help if he now goes into a real <UNK> for his film making skills if only for a couple of days to learn things like say structure proper lighting fluid camera movement subtlety with actors and other <UNK> that are <UNK> lost here br br it's all the more frustrating because is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public there was recently a <UNK> article referring to a similar <UNK> cult <UNK> many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas this is an ever <UNK> sensation throughout over the <UNK> where it almost feels like wants to tell the truth but doesn't know how to communicate it properly through his characters the character that one would think is closest to him <UNK> teen tony <UNK> <UNK> who is taken by his mother to a <UNK> in new jersey would be closest to is actually much more of a one dimensional being where there is very little back story we see a brief freak out in black and white in his old home and little connection to his mother <UNK> who has more potential that is never <UNK> aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another but there is a story to go with his two year crisis i guess br br right off the bat things get rough a nude <UNK> search in the first five minutes and soon it's clear that instead of medical care it's more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious <UNK> where the head doctor <UNK> is a total over controlling <UNK> but soon tony's sister <UNK> gets thrown in to the program and as opposed to tony's repeated moments of outrage and supposed non <UNK> she goes head on through the whacked out three step program and once released becoming a runaway at times there are bits in this <UNK> nightmare where there's one woman a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she's become a prisoner not allowed to leave and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an <UNK> visit to <UNK> when <UNK> finally returns to them that do contain some raw power very brief glimpses of being able to at least garner some <UNK> in pure melodrama br br but these are moments few and far between it's not just the <UNK> characters who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that <UNK> into being like hysterical d a r e rip offs maybe some of them like an angry black youth the passive aggressive <UNK> or even older sister who is <UNK> out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program would <UNK> more if there was more time given to develop any of them it's that is so <UNK> in his multiple roles on his tiny 30 000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through he over uses <UNK> mostly with a <UNK> that looks <UNK> <UNK> he his hand held <UNK> camera as if it's supposed to be intense ala city of god occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly his choices of music are like the worst <UNK> possible from pseudo indie soft <UNK> and there's even inane fake interview scenes with nicholas <UNK> inspiration and that feel about as false as possible br br could just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would be artistically <UNK> plan b bottom line no matter how much from the heart true life stories may appeal to you don't bother seeing it in the theater or even on rental unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digital <UNK> hudson river sunset with the final words reading dedicated to the kids <UNK>
<START> this is the latest entry in the long series of films with the french agent o s s <UNK> the french answer to james bond the series was launched in the early 1950's and <UNK> at least eight films none of which was ever released in the u s <UNK> s s <UNK> <UNK> nest of <UNK> is a <UNK> little comedy that should not repeat not be taken too seriously our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in egypt with doing stand in for egypt to find out about a long lost friend what follows is the standard james bond inspector kind of antics although our man is something of an overt <UNK> sexist it's treated as pure farce as i said don't take it too seriously although there is a bit of rough language cartoon violence it's basically okay for older kids ages 12 up as previously stated in the subject line just sit back pass the popcorn just enjoy
<START> i'll give it a two for denis <UNK> he had some good lines but that's it what was the point where was the script who was supposed to act a movie needs more than this one has to offer save the hour and a half to watch your hair grow or fall out whatever the case
<START> i watched this movie on tcm last night all excited expectation having last seen it twice in its memorable 1957 release in toronto i told my wife who hadn't seen it before to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot no cuts where <UNK> is seen on a bus on her way to find her boris in a hand held frame that certainly <UNK> the modern <UNK> the shot then pulls back up and <UNK> pun <UNK> over the street as she <UNK> the bus and <UNK> among the tanks to cross the road then i remember that no cuts we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through <UNK> looking for him but does not find him but we do continue to follow <UNK> as she <UNK> the faces of <UNK> <UNK> and their emotionally <UNK> women all extras and each one a gem of riveting behavior how one wonders did and his cameraman set up this extraordinary sequence but what did i see in this version after crossing the street <UNK> the tanks the scene abruptly ended and cut back to scenes at the apartment before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence seems to me that this film was not only restored but also re edited what a <UNK>
<START> all the characters in this cartoon were hilarious norman the <UNK> guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master the bad guy would always be <UNK> to kill max with some insane <UNK> the writing is the best br br i was glued to the set when this would come on when i was younger if they came out with a dvd of all the episodes they made i would be forced to buy it this and a conan the barbarian cartoon are the ones i miss the most from childhood i think these cartoons are the most <UNK> out of all the great cartoons i used to watch these cartoons on channel 13 in the los angeles area br br i remember the owl was always afraid warning max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one max didn't believe that he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble norman was less <UNK> but his simplicity was funny he would say things like i eat monsters for breakfast when he was battling them and then when he was battling zombies he would say i eat zombies for <UNK> classic cartoon comedy and action br br i vote that they re air mighty max
<START> after some internet surfing i found the <UNK> series on dvd at <UNK> com before anyone gets excited the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice over <UNK> for the <UNK> into the abc news program <UNK> complete with the top news <UNK> from the early 1990's even with the poor image quality the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine br br to this show's credit the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff <UNK> is played particularly well by kyle chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s <UNK> with vintage <UNK> and <UNK> the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case br br as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a <UNK> either curiously the first episode of the show <UNK> begins in 1945 after the war had ended that's like shooting the first episode of <UNK> island showing the <UNK> being rescued the whole premise of the show's <UNK> is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's by the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a <UNK> <UNK> vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda the show is set in river run <UNK> near <UNK> however the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson <UNK> than <UNK> part of the ensemble cast are dick williams <UNK> winston and sterling <UNK> jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being <UNK> against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years we get it we're also tired of having our <UNK> <UNK> in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also <UNK> with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for <UNK> the acting talents of williams winston and <UNK> were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in <UNK> was a <UNK> member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a <UNK> gets a well deserved <UNK> and leave it at that <UNK> a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid br br in yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory ken <UNK> is portrayed as an <UNK> scrooge like character who is against <UNK> and raises and is <UNK> about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer br br personally i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the <UNK> in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the <UNK> of food and gas <UNK> and working 14 hour days at war <UNK> of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or <UNK> <UNK> passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no the writers of <UNK> david <UNK> and james <UNK> completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead they totally missed the point and <UNK> into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to <UNK> the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage
<START> what i wouldn't do to give this film a re write extra disappointing due to the great beginning solo <UNK> <UNK> into a mess of <UNK> bull after the halfway point and ends on a note so ludicrous <UNK> and melodramatic i couldn't believe i was watching the same movie i started with the film had numerous elements in its favor such as chemistry between diego <UNK> and alice <UNK> so <UNK> i thought the screen would start <UNK> a great soundtrack and beautiful locations instead of ending with the heavy handed religious <UNK> <UNK> the film should have kept the focus on being a <UNK> road movie with maybe some undertones about fate and <UNK> vs logic <UNK> through i understand the director's entire intent with the film was to make it about religion but the fact is that it just didn't work and he threw away so much great stuff from the beginning by doing so
<START> <UNK> express from the disney studios isn't quite as dated as some of their <UNK> from this era there are no hippies or hot <UNK> just dull as <UNK> dean jones <UNK> a <UNK> hotel <UNK> resort from a deceased relative when jones and family pull into a sleepy <UNK> town the folks who give them directions looking like extras from deliverance are curiously vague about the hotel we expect it to look like a one room <UNK> but actually the <UNK> are very nice jones' teenage daughter has a sour look on her face throughout which doesn't prevent one of the local <UNK> from <UNK> at her and of course clumsy pop dean jones is a regular on the <UNK> leading to a lot of <UNK> in the <UNK> perhaps this square scenario <UNK> <UNK> from some magical <UNK> for this script is a frozen stiff from
<START> the filmmakers were clearly on drugs that's the only explanation i have how else do you explain this travesty of a jane austen adaptation <UNK> <UNK> is a parody of a gothic novel but this film was made as if it were a gothic novel the bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest drug induced hallucinations rather than a naive innocent girl with an <UNK> imagination as catherine of the novel is br br the actress who played catherine just stands around bug eyed all the time peter <UNK> looks at least 10 years too old to play henry and he actually seemed a bit on the gay side to me i don't see the attraction between him and catherine john portrayal was rather odd but <UNK> actually wasn't that bad but nothing could save this piece of crap movie one more thing this film <UNK> a character not in the book a french friend of general the why exactly they added her is beyond me must have been the drugs she is scary looking beyond belief with white foundation red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face <UNK> br br you'd think this would at least be entertaining in a so bad it's good quality but unfortunately it's not it's just bad
<START> a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere one had a flat tire the other's <UNK> mysteriously won't start one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him when the remaining <UNK> go in search of their friend they come across nice mr who offers to help fix the <UNK> and offers cool drinks and <UNK> from the heat in his equally run down <UNK> like house which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking <UNK> he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack he warns them about <UNK> his brother who is lurking about and isn't all there of course one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again is it is it <UNK> the <UNK> tourist trap has the usual horror <UNK> <UNK> big girl <UNK> two shoes girl curiosity getting the better of people and never working out but it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's twist of an ending i started to feel sorry for chuck is a terrific creepy over the top performance at a point in the film and you almost see the character of molly doing the same this is a gem if you can find it i had taped it off of cable when i was younger and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally <UNK> but well worth it fans of <UNK> roberts won't be disappointed either best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup and <UNK> br br i gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain
<START> i first saw love in <UNK> playing late on free to air tv about five years ago and since then it's a movie i'll always remember <UNK> as one of those films you see and are forever influenced by br br for the <UNK> australian film has a long history of making off beat comedies about lovable losers and love in <UNK> is a sterling example of this whilst <UNK> <UNK> is the only name actor in it although these days he's all a movie needs the rest of the aussie cast is good he still steals the show as a nervous nerdy virgin loser though br br the general premise is a lot like american pie a group of friends wanting to get laid and become men as you'd expect the entire movie on this with a sub plot about the <UNK> mother and various other incidents and is full of humorous situations that push it towards the inevitably sweet ending br br if you enjoyed american pie don't expect this to be the same but expect the same conventions to make appearances love in <UNK> isn't a gross out romantic comedy but it definitely has its share of laughs fist <UNK> moments when the good guy wins and the situations every guy australian or otherwise can relate to br br see it if you liked american pie almost famous strengths good aussie cast easy to relate to good value weaknesses predictable at points my rating 8 out of 10
<START> this movie was by far the best ever i think whoever shot it with the <UNK> hand held camera was a genius and the special effects were spectacular especially the chicken breast heart thank goodness this movie only cost me a dollar to rent also the green toxic <UNK> <UNK> was amazing i could have shot this movie with my friends in high school i would not recommend this movie to anyone you might want to kill yourself instead of watching it i also feel like this was a move for porn stars trying to make it into the legitimate movie business give it to her
<START> this movie isn't even good enough for the 1 bin at the <UNK> store br br i only purchased it because <UNK> howard was in it guess he couldn't be too about his roles during this time br br the movie in itself was hard to sit through it seemed they were <UNK> at <UNK> with a storyline the guys night out had to be the most boring i've ever seen one minute they are talking and the next <UNK> poetry even the arguments were hard to follow most of the acting lacked any depth br br i have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark
<START> i still remember watching <UNK> for the first time i was completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to <UNK> br br when i watched <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own <UNK> now the quote by <UNK> in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it <UNK> you realize that it is part of their routine br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all <UNK> means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director <UNK> manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems non existent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall br br but for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the <UNK> acting from each and every character has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues i'm afraid i'll end up re writing the entire script of the movie br br the movie boasts of some stellar performances <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> as sub inspector <UNK> and so is as joint <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have small roles which they play to perfection as the rookie was a revelation the scene where he has to <UNK> shoot the wounded gangster  oh my god he learns under the <UNK> of and firmly believes in him br br as is impressive his conversations with are real <UNK> of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster br br not that i have not been a fan of <UNK> <UNK> before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a <UNK> <UNK> as inspector gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best i've ever seen in hindi cinema from the way he talks to his expressions from the way he <UNK> his cigarette to the way his tea  it's almost as if <UNK> can do no wrong he is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching about how the police force functions his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country it's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one br br last but in no way the least <UNK> does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and <UNK> them to the <UNK> to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in an industry that is <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> stories from here and there <UNK> takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues the great work and doesn't give in to bollywood if he can do that i'm sure he'll be a force to <UNK> with in the coming years
<START> i'll put this as <UNK> as possible for those of you unaware of bill legacy he was quite simply the greatest stand up comedian in the world almost certainly in my opinion the greatest that ever lived his stand up idol being the great richard <UNK> whose battles with addiction he <UNK> his death in 1994 went barely noticed in the popular media coming just weeks after kurt <UNK> had committed suicide his tragic death at such a young age <UNK> any sense of the injustice that he was criminally ignored during his life of course but the harsh truth is clear as day nobody has stepped up to claim his <UNK> there is not a stand up comedian alive with nearly the skill and invention br br the observation is made in the <UNK> tribute it's just a that stand up comedians often view the job as a stepping stone to <UNK> <UNK> lame movies and morally driven sitcoms made to <UNK> but never <UNK> the lives of an unimaginative audience it's everything that bill <UNK> spoke against his <UNK> was always a <UNK> cry for people think for themselves to authority to come together as one race br br his appeal continues to grow with every passing year since his death his star will continue to shine long after so many lesser lights have blew out once you've been exposed to his brilliant intelligent but ultimately compassionate <UNK> you will be <UNK> and rewarded br br the man himself was fond to quote dylan to live outside the law you must be <UNK> he said bill <UNK> was honest beyond that he was the funniest of them all
<START> this is truly a funny movie his dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes i can recall i thought the i am gay scene at the high school <UNK> ceremony a bit <UNK> though it was funny while watching it for the third time i started to pick up on a little small segments that i had missed one was when matt <UNK> girl friend a classic <UNK> tried to use a <UNK> phone which she had never used before kevin <UNK> made this film successful along tom <UNK> this was also the first time i could appreciate debbie reynolds she proved that she can be funny she confirmed this in the tv series <UNK> and grace ' one discovery that i found after the third viewing is lauren <UNK> of feet fame she sticks out with her red <UNK> but it is obvious that this is one of her first films bob <UNK> is also very funny at the high school principle
<START> yes dumb is the word for this actress i know many have mentioned her beauty but this viewer found her empty headed and boring to watch with her <UNK> hair lip <UNK> and not so perfect body watch her walk away in those <UNK> showing a rather large butt her butt <UNK> beyond her shoulders what does that tell you as for the leading man played by gorgeous mark <UNK> he was perfectly cast a <UNK> however he and <UNK> just didn't match she was out of place opposite this good looking guy good acting by susan glover as the sister angela had a small role and was okay but the film's director <UNK> <UNK> wasted too much footage on <UNK> after a while you got tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability and what a bitch of a wife she was <UNK> on her husband being obnoxious to him and just a plain spoiled brat was happy to see her hit with the <UNK> gun i thought it might be the end of her but alas the script tells us otherwise after torturing myself and watching this loser again i still came up with the same criticism <UNK> is boring to watch this time around her hair folks her hair constantly in her face constantly <UNK> it back became annoying i question the writer alexandra reason why a good looking wealthy man like <UNK> would even bother with the likes of a bimbo like allison when there were so many attractive intelligent women with class to choose he picks this nothing is this the rochester jane eyre thing oh well it's all a matter of taste i guess this sarah <UNK> is not my cup of tea folks
<START> and you'd be right black mama white mama also known as <UNK> in chains ' is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy b movie that the premise suggests pam <UNK> has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women and this place seriously makes the summer camp where martha stewart is locked up right now look like a maximum security prison it's not five minutes into the movie that one of the <UNK> guards <UNK> the line 'em and get 'em wet ' and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college <UNK> fantasy of what the inside of a <UNK> house is like br br the prisoners soap and rub and <UNK> with each other in the shower like it's a girls gone wild shoot then they all hang out together in their <UNK> openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape i've never been to prison myself but i have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about prisoners or guards or otherwise the biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy <UNK> life is that the women in this movie all wear orange and no pants go figure that say prison on the back must be those generic prison outfits for <UNK> that can't afford <UNK> <UNK> like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms br br and as is to be expected a prison that can't afford to put prisoner <UNK> on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in <UNK> the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each other br br the conflict of the movie's title refers to the fact that lee daniels pam <UNK> spends much of the time <UNK> to a blonde prisoner named karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison i won't go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in the fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck and it leads into the muddled story of the <UNK> interests also chasing these two women for different reasons karen and lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner and the cops are after both of them all the while br br spoilers so karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to <UNK> life as they know it meanwhile karen just wants to get off the island something she's been trying to do for years and isn't it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals so we get this odd couple pairing and since they are an odd couple it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the end br br in a movie with so many <UNK> interests especially when those <UNK> interests not only <UNK> the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals it is not <UNK> to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie not about to leave anyone <UNK> they throw in a stupid gang <UNK> at the end of the movie where everyone shoots machine guns at each other killing each other en <UNK> while the two women <UNK> safely and <UNK> across the river in a little boat nice br br even better at the end of the movie after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and <UNK> bright red paint all over the place the captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful awful special effects and we learn that he will be a major before dinner not a bad way to end the movie the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit but here is the last line in the film  <UNK> better to win isn't it ' br br is that why the captain is going to get promoted to major because he figured that out
<START> <UNK> directed by jules <UNK> is in line with the <UNK> crime pictures particularly bob le and to a point le <UNK> of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesn't need and was ahead of its time it still has a kind of <UNK> among its characters a kind of respect if not for <UNK> than for others a kind of duty that rings well in post ww2 france its actors carry faces for these characters that say <UNK> know what these guys are <UNK> and from there the story takes off maybe it's because i have a weak spot for heist pictures particularly where we see just the nuts and <UNK> <UNK> actual physical side of how a heist is pulled off br br one of the problems with how the actual heist is filmed in today's movies is that it's all very fast i e snatch or done in ways we've seen too many times before <UNK> like <UNK> years later decided to create practically a silent film of a heist sound effects included the tension that builds up in this scene may not top what <UNK> had in but on its own level it achieves its own greatness and momentum and just as crucial originality to what's been done before there are some kept close ups for example as the safe is being <UNK> that mark some of the best i've seen from france at that time an added plus for the film aside from the <UNK> stage new wave touch to the film which in the end makes it a little more modern is that the story works so well and differently it becomes completely about character at points and then keeps up the thrills the last ten to fifteen minutes are down right <UNK> like with another classic heist picture the <UNK> jungle it's not even the last stop that matters but all about how much one will go past the call of duty putting <UNK> over greed br br you almost wonder in all the <UNK> of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that he might just make it <UNK> has here a very entertaining and <UNK> film of its genre with a nifty little musical number as well
<START> it is movie about love violence illegal affairs and romanian <UNK> a romanian story combined with an <UNK> adaption resulting in a modern international film that can be understood both by western audiences but as well by eastern european audiences that have long forgotten about the conservative over film making br br a film full of violent fight scenes that are very numerous and create more and more <UNK> situations as the movie goes on br br a story that <UNK> because of its view over the hard life from the <UNK> two young men do illegal car races they work together as a team and <UNK> from their <UNK> but when they are asked by a local <UNK> to lose one race things start to get messy and the <UNK> from the bomb lights up creating a very movie that will keep you close to the screen until the ending of it when you will still be asking yourself a lot of questions long after that br br brilliant acting both by <UNK> and along with high quality directing and screen writing by the young but talented director also give a unique charm to <UNK> all this and many other elements that can be noticed while watching have created a must see movie by all the around the world and its message is clear to all not depending of race language we speak or country it is a real hope for the romanian cinema as it tries to keep up with the more advanced <UNK> cinema br br i hope you enjoy watching it as i'm sure that all the people that have seen it liked it and understood it
<START> this has to be one of the best movies we have seen and we highly recommend it for it's exposure of the <UNK> of <UNK> billy <UNK> is an <UNK> actor and truly awesome as <UNK> white wolf however felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes this is a movie that can be watched over and over without <UNK>
<START> i have it on vhs but its not a great copy as i have watched it 2 or 3 times per year since 1999 i am also in fear that will throw it out in the <UNK> vhs <UNK> br br my brother and i late still laugh at the carry on in this fantastic show tim lucky cup hat and telling the apprentice you can do none of that shooting passing etc and he turns out to be peter <UNK> as a fan i have to laugh at the empty on before the cup final or did it say s t br br the reason i came on line today was that my <UNK> wants it for christmas so <UNK> please bring it out on dvd come on the men
<START> <UNK> is different <UNK> film but the things which makes it different are copied abroad some techniques of narration are from <UNK> <UNK> jackie brown and elephant scenes are shot from different angles again <UNK> is a good movie but it isn't so good that the hype realistic movie no happy end and no commercial some actors did great job was so good as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> shows his skills but was so lame he is so overrated actor he's handsome and a nice guy but not the best actor of <UNK> but if you like <UNK> movies <UNK> is worth to see
<START> ok everybody is so <UNK> by this film i hardly dare add a negative review but i just did not enjoy this movie br br i have to say first i saw the film in russian language <UNK> so i will have missed some dialog but not much br br nice things first there are some hilarious moments the elvis <UNK> for instance actors seem well casted also the russians is great and goldblum is very good which brings us to the <UNK> of this movie first of all there is hardly any story and the end we know already wins so no drama or suspense they tried to solve this problem with an <UNK> affair between the actors mentioned above but that story kind of <UNK> br br more importantly the film does not represent reality the russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this movie are not funny they are a serious and dangerous lot i am willing to believe that flying in some spin doctors from the states helped win his campaign but the real interesting questions that should be addressed are who <UNK> the campaign what did they get in return how was the opposition handled apart from airing some commercials br br so what we have here is a film loosely based on reality but strangely avoiding anything that could make the film either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller without plot or subplot
<START> i'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies which it is not even though <UNK> did appear in he played a totally different character he was eight years older in this film okay so reid and martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves but to trade on the <UNK> franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies i'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was <UNK> into thinking that they were seeing a sequel not a totally different film with a familiar name and i'm sorry <UNK> is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris <UNK> lester or <UNK> <UNK> in the earlier films although good and <UNK> <UNK> are a substantial visual <UNK> i have to give this a thumbs down just <UNK> the film down to the last minute would have been ok furthermore the brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> uses its protagonist <UNK> <UNK> as a metaphor for <UNK> celebrities from a decade in america's shameful past which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography therefore resulting in an abundance of <UNK> youth its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been <UNK> in by celebrities in hollywood and all too often exploited by the press it seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an e true hollywood story special drugs sex and violence the american dream but what goes up must come down and the bigger it is the harder it falls br br <UNK> dreams are huge as is another valuable asset on his body real name is eddie adams a <UNK> who dreams of becoming a star he believes that god gives one great talent to every individual on the planet and his gift is a rather unusual one after falling out with his mother eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy jack <UNK> burt reynolds an adult film director who offers him work eddie eventually becomes a major porn star representing the leading actor in most of <UNK> films with <UNK> success eddie is told that he needs to <UNK> a new <UNK> for himself and so <UNK> <UNK> is born br br eddie <UNK> himself is primarily based on infamous porn star john holmes whose life story was adapted in 2003 with <UNK> which starred val kilmer <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> the better of the two proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience regular cinema goers br br the film takes place in 1977 an era of artistic pornography filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of x rated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere in a way the film's director paul thomas anderson <UNK> a very artistic approach to the project resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in american history when <UNK> was indeed both gratuitous and artistic <UNK> style is so deep and so distinct that we soon feel as if we are <UNK> the era first hand not a moment goes by where we are <UNK> of the time range dealt with in the film br br all was not happy on the set of <UNK> <UNK> prior to filming anderson approached reynolds repeatedly asking him many separate times to play the role of <UNK> eventually reynolds agreed but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career <UNK> <UNK> it before being nominated for a best supporting actor academy award and suddenly <UNK> up a year before anderson had suffered title <UNK> over sydney hard eight he preferred the latter title for his film and new line cinema thought the former was more <UNK> he essentially lost the battle and anderson wisely avoided title <UNK> this time around by <UNK> the words boogie nights into his movie through the mouth of a character br br the casting of the film is one of its finest aspects the paul thomas anderson <UNK> are here as well as a whole top notch cast of first <UNK> to name some of the more well known stars john c <UNK> phillip seymour hoffman luis <UNK> william h macy heather graham and <UNK> moore but the entire movie essentially borders down to mark <UNK> as eddie who is surprisingly convincing in his role <UNK> previously known for his singing career and disappointing hollywood <UNK> has all the necessary traits to portray such a character this is his best role to date br br anderson knows how to <UNK> his audience and take complete control of every scene when jack <UNK> first meets eddie anderson <UNK> uses stars in the backdrop a sign of things to come and hidden symbolism as finely <UNK> as it can be the opening scene is three minutes a long tracking shot that follows jack and <UNK> into a night club where most of the characters are first introduced it reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in robert altman's 'the it works so brilliantly in boogie nights and is the first indication that anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera his style is fast paced in the vein of martin scorsese where shots <UNK> around quite quickly but never seem rushed incidentally anderson references two classic scorsese shots the closing de niro mirror speech from and the tracking nightclub scene from <UNK> anderson is a young growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction despite his age whereas his first feature film was <UNK> wise and poignant <UNK> <UNK> is even more so br br <UNK> <UNK> began as an effort of love on paul thomas <UNK> account having filmed the extraordinary hard eight in 1996 <UNK> film is <UNK> to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine boogie nights <UNK> us with its gratuitous content occasionally <UNK> on the verge of pornography only it is far more sophisticated than such trash it is a blazing wonderful modern day masterpiece that is as mind numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish arguably <UNK> best film and among the greatest and most important projects of the last decade
<START> to understand crash course in the right context you must understand the 80's in tv most tv shows didn't have any point the sitcom the drama at least 3 to 1 they were still <UNK> out where the lines were so that they could cross them tv shows like <UNK> to the chief was quite the bold step this made for tv movie crash course featured an all star cast bringing together members from all the 80's classics <UNK> family ties who's the boss et al directors must've had a certain <UNK> for those all star movies then still this movie offered very light fare and a simplistic view of <UNK> and maturity and that's not bad sometimes <UNK> <UNK> moon frye
<START> here's yet another movie with dysfunctional lead characters who are totally amoral and yet we're supposed to root for them not me no character in this film was worth a damn br br robin williams plays car salesman joey o'brien the man has no class a loser in every moral sense and a guy who thinks he can talk his way out of anything knowing <UNK> ability to talk he was good for this role the women in his life are driving him loony too some of them aren't much better than him br br tim robbins plays a similar low life who starts the take over the film when he fully loaded with <UNK> crashes into a car <UNK> <UNK> and holds people including his wife hostage robbins as in normal for him plays a disturbed and ridiculous character i guess these nut case roles come easily to these two actors gee i wonder why br br there is so much yelling and screaming in this the movie that it will give you a headache combine those two with the <UNK> voice of <UNK> and you really have an annoying over the top cast this is like listening to <UNK> on a <UNK> for an hour and a half this is comedy no this is lame br br in fact for a robin williams film to only have a dozen reviews posted here tells you something it's a far cry from his best movie
<START> this movie <UNK> on very familiar ground the confusion of art and reality in the life of actors it does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull the final scene in particular is <UNK> tedious seeing the audience crying at the moving acting they are seeing on the screen made me ask who do they think they are kidding br br nevertheless there are some good performances and interesting scenes particularly from some of the minor characters ben <UNK> plays an old and slightly touched actor who gets a whole <UNK> of policemen <UNK> his performance when they come to arrest him br br christopher walken again plays an over the top <UNK> remember his character the <UNK> on saturday night live an aging <UNK> chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her into bed he does an identical turn in the film chasing his young male prey around an <UNK> table and <UNK> him with <UNK> br br overall this film was both enchanting and irritating but mostly irritating
<START> <UNK> is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi at a film will do little to compensate for a rubbish script the basic premise is fine what if a freak storm threatened to send the sea straight over the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> london so fast that most of the inhabitants would probably never get out in time it's basically the new york segment of 'the day after <UNK> but that shouldn't make it any less of a film however the script just isn't there it's merely <UNK> flat and lacking in depth great british talents like robert and david <UNK> to name but two do their level best with what they've got but their characters are two dimensional <UNK> like something out of an old marvel comic and it'd be frankly easier to turn back the tide not that every actor gets let off the hook tom seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film but then he wasn't given much of a challenge br br i applaud any opportunity to see some non hollywood disaster flicks for a change and i don't expect <UNK> of dollars spent on rendering ultra realistic graphics however there's no excuse for <UNK> writing especially from a country that has produced some of the best science fiction ever made on next to no budget at all this is the kind of half hearted b grade fluff the sci fi channel produces and that's hardly a target to aim for if like me you are such a fan of disaster films you're still tempted do yourself a favour and watch it with some friends better still don't bother
<START> this ultra low budget kitchen sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the uk in that anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green light would be given most probably self <UNK> this is clearly an attempt to <UNK> important issues but ultimately <UNK> its point of existence in that the question needs to be <UNK> who would ever put money into <UNK> this and secondly if a market audience doesn't exist to watch buy or rent this film why would anyone bother in the first place my opinions may sound unfairly harsh on a first time director but this is the kind of film that only goes to <UNK> the commercial <UNK> and quality standards which have only just kept a british film industry in existence reviewed in <UNK> 2 out of 10
<START> i like dylan <UNK> from his work in black books although i found some of his stand up to be really indulgent in terms of long confused gaps however i was intrigued to see this film starring he and michael caine and curiosity got the better of me br br i was stunned br br <UNK> vocal range and characterisation of the different people he was playing in the film was absolutely perfect something beyond the skills of a mere stand up comedian and really truly on a par with alec guinness john hurt and the other <UNK> truly he was skilled in his portrayal br br michael caine was a very convincing <UNK> donna and the standard british film device of having a <UNK> child on hand to be overly wise and <UNK> worked the only aspect i didn't really like was the <UNK> plot feature of the chemistry between <UNK> and the cockney hard man played by dylan br br other than that it was great br br i also like the non cop out ending where it did end up happily ever after but with <UNK> getting a beating ok it's not exactly being strung up by your <UNK> and which is what a real crime boss would do to you if you <UNK> off them but it showed at least a small measure of reality in the story br br i liked the film and i would recommend it to anyone but i would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes because it started a bit slow if you stick it out then it will all come back br br and with regards to the swearing well they're in ireland it wouldn't be real otherwise
<START> robert <UNK> myrna loy farce about loy irene and her fiancé played by <UNK> owen stranded in <UNK> when their plane crashes that's really what should have happened to this highly predictable film <UNK> lives there while he is waiting for his fiancé br br surprise <UNK> and loy are soon attracted to each other the scene with the bear is so contrived we knew it was a <UNK> bear all along br br complications ensue when clara shows up loy wants <UNK> to tell clara that they should part ways when he refuses she wants to leave at once br br you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end out with all that snow it's just too cold for anyone
<START> the charge at <UNK> river is a routine western about the u s <UNK> against the <UNK> indians the film carried a constantly <UNK> tension with some pleasant <UNK> br br guy madison and frank <UNK> play the officers who rescue helen and vera miles from the indians br br the <UNK> scenes are well photographed specially the exciting indian charge at <UNK> river at the climax of the movie with the rain of spears the fight to the death between madison and the sketches of the <UNK> even a <UNK> of <UNK> juice used against a <UNK> and the romantic <UNK> between our hero and helen all are here <UNK> entertaining in 3 d and technicolor
<START> i saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though i knew it wasn't of award winning caliber i kinda liked it it tales the tale of 5 former <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids which is to climb <UNK> <UNK> of course now the <UNK> <UNK> are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways but none too differently than they were as children richard lewis is still neurotic richard <UNK> is still a playboy <UNK> is still sort of the dear <UNK> of the group and tim <UNK> is still the <UNK> dude of the group of course the top billed star is <UNK> anderson a true believer in everything <UNK> <UNK> related he still lives in the same house with his mother still goes over the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> daily is brave <UNK> and clean and is the one who <UNK> the others for one more grand adventure in <UNK> <UNK> their task however is the brothers two bullies <UNK> out of the <UNK> <UNK> by the above mentioned by coincidence they run into their old <UNK> and decide to <UNK> them a bit albeit <UNK> not so <UNK> is three escaped <UNK> who think pack 7 is from the fbi and are intent on <UNK> them out all in all the movie still has bits of charm observe richard lewis trying to get comfortable on a <UNK> <UNK> for example and you have a really funny bit going for you upon further review the entire film needed more of that type of <UNK> humor it doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure
<START> beautiful art direction excellent editing and wonderful stories make this some of the best television ever produced the fact that it was relatively short lived is sadly <UNK> on the state of television i highly recommend <UNK> these up as they're released you'll love them
<START> awful awful awful drab unimaginative predictable and with all the usual suspects exactly the sort of film the irish film industry shouldn't be making and with the added bonus of a <UNK> <UNK> ending a sickening example of how talent originality is by passed in favour of an almost aggressive mediocrity yes the children are sweet yes it almost looks like it's done <UNK> but this is film making by numbers a direct smash and grab on what the director obviously thinks is a film which and <UNK> the audience it's quite amazing that working title would pour into this rubbish but then they paid for love actually don't waste your money
<START> seldom is seen a film sequel that surpasses or even the greatness of it's original predecessor such a film is virtual encounters 2 br br it's about a couple guys in college who sell virtual sex to the entire campus if you like seeing naked chicks this one delivers six foot tall <UNK> <UNK> is an amazing <UNK> and you will be dreaming about her for days if you ever have the good fortune to catch the <UNK> version she wears just the right amount of body <UNK> in her multiple nude scenes and her giant <UNK> appear to be real br br w the exception of james <UNK> aliens francis for <UNK> the godfather part ii and of course the airplane 2 this is the only sequel in movie history that takes a classic film and <UNK> upon it br br it's criminal the way this film was ignored by the academy <UNK> fritz and that broad who gets tied up in the beginning as well as the brunette who gets a towards the end all deserved best supporting actress <UNK> br br shame on you hollywood
<START> let me ask you one more question ha what a great soon this movie was brilliant fantastic acting great script the only reason no one noticed it was because of the low budget everyone will agree with me that its a cult just like <UNK> <UNK> it shows a young joe <UNK> once again as a mobster this film is up their with the <UNK> its got some sopranos and some <UNK> chase got his idea for the sopranos when he watched this and scorsese found joe <UNK> while watching it that proves it must be a great am i right or am i wrong i've got to admit they showed one brilliant scene where they were throwing <UNK> at a camp piano player stop with the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> wow where do i begin after suffering through this wretched 1 00 rental thanks a lot family video i just had to make a few comments i did not bother to write down the names of the 3 actors in the film but hopefully you will know who i am talking about br br a monster truck <UNK> the countryside and chases two college aged buddies to their doom they encounter a hot girl wearing <UNK> clothes i mean this just sounds fantastic in theory i was laughing hysterically at the dvd box while i walked it up to the girl behind the counter at the video store br br acting the hot girl played by <UNK> whatever is <UNK> laughing through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared the other two major actors in the film the fat <UNK> and the vanilla straight guy are both terrible the fat guy thinks he's jack black he's not the other actor our hero over <UNK> and misses all his <UNK> and comes across as some generic character you might see in a made for <UNK> movie about <UNK> in the early 90's look i don't expect great performances in movies like these but at least the actors can make an effort to not be annoying you can be an incompetent actor but still be <UNK> i e john wayne at least that <UNK> gal is attractive br br script holy who thought this dialogue was funny i wouldn't have the nerve to play this out in front of my grade school drama class much less pitch it as a film script <UNK> bad more on this later br br production ok this is the one place where the film definitely succeeds production quality is amazingly high the look of the film is very good apparently the only talented person who worked on the movie was the director of photography br br ok here are my biggest <UNK> 1 the guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles an hour br br 2 the guy driving the car is well out into the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in his back seat he is supposedly <UNK> about recording gas <UNK> and keeping his <UNK> car in good condition but he does not notice a jack black <UNK> in the back come on br br 4 characters never change their clothes there are two hotel scenes presumably <UNK> are available to our characters yet over the 3 days this movie takes place none of the characters bothers to change their clothes br br 5 comedy lighthearted slapstick comedy does not mix with horror period you can't have our characters running away from a monster truck one second and the next second have them <UNK> <UNK> one another with some dopey light comedy music playing this kind of pacing virtually ruins any tension in the movie movies like evil dead 2 which mix comedy and horror understand that tension can be <UNK> yet never completely eliminated with humor monster man doesn't get it br br i'm irritated that what could have been a very funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was a lot more clever than he really was oh well
<START> i saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes i read somewhere that oz and wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies also some of the humor is a bit on the <UNK> side joan cusack was too over the top for me and someone has a strange <UNK> re the oscars still there were more than enough funny moments like the kiss scene the wedding that isn't and the scene with the principal to enjoy this kline as always is good but for me the real surprise was <UNK> whom i'm not a big fan of but <UNK> fun at himself nicely here
<START> this film looks great and that's about where my praise ends love is a many thing came out in the very <UNK> year of 1955 when candy <UNK> nonsense like this co existed with trail blazing artistic fair like kiss me deadly as a trend toward smaller socially conscious films like on the <UNK> and marty established itself in the mid 50's other directors felt the need to stick with the <UNK> <UNK> melodrama that <UNK> so many other films from that decade and love is one of the latter br br this is the kind of 50's movie where the technicolor is used to its <UNK> <UNK> and the lighting is <UNK> high key even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are <UNK> than the average sunny day i never want to hear the theme song again as it's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime and i certainly don't want to hear it sung by the shrill ear <UNK> choir that <UNK> it out over the end titles jennifer jones and william <UNK> are passable but really anybody could have played these parts jones' role is horribly written her character is incredibly inconsistent and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something the screenwriters <UNK> a <UNK> to decide what that decision would be br br people will undoubtedly tell me i'm taking this film too seriously that i'm <UNK> etc but i loved all that heaven allows released the same year and just as <UNK> in its own way except that douglas sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form whereas henry king director of love is not br br i'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama but in this case i was just bored br br grade d
<START> barney and friends the <UNK> the <UNK> of the 1990s br br ok i'll admit it as a kid barney was my ultimate hero i had my barney <UNK> toy and i used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on <UNK> maybe cause it was so sugar <UNK> and mind numbing br br however by the time i turned 7 i started to hate barney everyone at school would <UNK> barney and i went along with it mainly because it was funny and it's what little boys do but a few years later i discovered something else about barney that i will never forget br br a person known on the imdb as angel did an <UNK> for school explaining the dangers of watching barney and he or she posted it in the message boards a lot of those dangers made sense br br barney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a day at school he is supposedly educational or so <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> creator says but really all i can remember him teaching me is that magic can solve anything which is not true br br to end off this comment i'd like to tell you a little story there was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney one day he was alone when a stranger <UNK> him into his car and drove away with him i don't know the outcome but it's safe to assume the child died but why was he <UNK> in the first place because he watched the barney and friends episode titled a stranger is a friend you haven't met yet br br 0 10
<START> i hoped to learn something from this movie but i was disappointed it is all about <UNK> and him as a great general but at no time in this entire movie did we ever get an idea of why he was great what made him so successful was it his drive his <UNK> to accept defeat his discipline with his men i was looking for a <UNK> like rendition that really gets into the character but this fell way flat most of the dialog is contrived and <UNK> and feels stale and artificial there is some good action here and there but not much the tail end of the story which <UNK> his involvement in the plot to <UNK> hitler was the most informative part and probably the most interesting but as a history lesson on <UNK> greatest general this was a failure
<START> i bought this thing used at a video game <UNK> <UNK> bin i wanted to get that guilty feeling from watching something i've been warned is too intense to watch i wanted the shock value i wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a banned film i was very disappointed br br cannibal <UNK> does not work because it is so campy and fake most of the time the camera does not show you the shocking stabs chops <UNK> you just see the aftermath they do show a breast <UNK> in detail the special effects are just ok nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real the cannibals are obviously poor people from central south america who were dressed up as jungle <UNK> and told to act mean these people were obviously in on the whole picture to get a little money or food or both again just not convincing br br however like everyone else has said there is some real killing of animals going on here that is the extent of the realism to me that was more shocking than any <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> and even then the animal deaths are not that gory at all maybe just sad
<START> surprisingly <UNK> this movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes cliché script that also seems a work of a poor observation sometimes there is an isolated young boy he lives with one of his relatives but he is lonely and every night watches a woman who lives across their building it seems that he wants her he is one of the <UNK> who are not good at communication with the opposite sex however he likes that woman when the woman comes to his house with a man gets pain then we understand that <UNK> tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female to <UNK> or who falls in love with a mature woman he does not do something else because may be he knows that it is his salvation one day he stops that woman suddenly he seems a shy boy but proves that he is not so he explains her almost everything she <UNK> and refuses him everything is so realistic like the other <UNK> films no problem the problems start when visits her the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman but an <UNK> love turns into the story of a lonely young boy falls in love with a mature woman at the <UNK> the woman refuses but after a short time she starts to change her mind this u turn makes the movie cliché firstly the personality of is weird or a result of a poor observation i disappointed with this character this is my opinion and i will try to tell why when he goes to her house <UNK> treats him very friendly she asks what do you want from me to kiss me to make love with me to go out with me at this point i remember the people who say she is a femme fatale see returning to the scene rejects all the <UNK> why because he is shy i don't think so but his communication is blunt ok after the leg scene at home some events make the movie misses its aim i think that the aim of the movie is should have been according to the story to show us there are some people who suffer from lack of <UNK> and to save from this situation is not easy <UNK> to lack of communication and being <UNK> especially for men i mean that at this point what does the movie say it is <UNK> and disappointing it is seen that he is not <UNK> for love or a female or sex then what and the suicide attempt scene support this weakness so that he touches her legs he wants to kill himself by the way as i mentioned before some say <UNK> is a femme fatale totally not she <UNK> in order to make happy does she avoid having contact with him no does she insult him no does she <UNK> him no and does she <UNK> him no she has some troubles with her ex lover so she is not o k however she does not take revenge for it from she is not an angel but not a femme fatale also
<START> this is by far the most pathetic movie indian cinema or any cinema has come up with it is totally a piece of crap the story line <UNK> not hold any water it is shameful that such a <UNK> actor has <UNK> to such a low on making such a <UNK> movie the little respect he had is lost forever he should have retired longtime ago instead of making a fool of himself and <UNK> all the self respect i would not recommend this movie to any one furthermore i would suggest that amitabh should <UNK> already i wonder how imdb has given some <UNK> to this movie there are no movies so horrible that any <UNK> could be made seeing such movies as <UNK> in the same line as this movie does a grave injustice to a decent movie its overall i could say shameless
<START> a humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business it's easy watching and even offers <UNK> <UNK> stealing a scene from an old fred ginger movie walken is over the top as a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> in the <UNK> business trying to bring a new style to an old <UNK> town we see a couple of very funny examples of the new style the plot <UNK> with <UNK> having an affair with <UNK> and her suggesting that they do <UNK> in meanwhile <UNK> has his long suffering romantic feeling for <UNK> and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the south <UNK> and dance away their days together during the fake funeral <UNK> learns of her <UNK> <UNK> and plots her revenge watch it for a view of what <UNK> probably should be a celebration of life
<START> if you find the hopelessly amateurish acting the uninteresting story the fake blood and all the mindless shooting bearable then you may actually have a fairly good time watching this trashy low rent exploitation film you might also want to check out a pretty good sequence that's offered although it's not good enough to make the rest of the movie worth sitting through
<START> i was watching this movie and getting increasingly bored with the silly plot that was going nowhere when suddenly the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself oh how i <UNK> because it's <UNK> funny isn't it we know julia roberts is playing the character of tess and here they are in the film cracking the joke that the character of tess looks a bit like julia roberts so julia plays someone <UNK> julia how well she does this we'll never know because 99 <UNK> of the audience don't actually know julia roberts personally and reading about her in hello magazine doesn't count br br and then bruce willis turns up apparently he's julia <UNK> best friend well he is in the film how would i know whether or not bruce willis and julia roberts even know each other i'm not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors i just pay my money and expect them to do the job they're paid to do anyway they start cracking jokes about the plot twist in the film where willis rather <UNK> plays a psychiatrist the one with the little kid in it you know the one i don't i've forgotten what it's called willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office how modest of you mr willis br br the problem is that not only are these scenes pointless and horribly horribly self indulgent it also remind us the viewers that we're simply watching a bunch of actors <UNK> around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort you see when i see a movie i want to suspend disbelief and forget that i'm watching actors i want to believe in the story i'm watching when you start pulling the scenery down mid movie you simply ruin the illusion for me br br you know that a tv series has jumped the shark when it starts introducing celebrities playing themselves stand up and be counted the simpsons friends etc but this is the first time i've seen a movie jump the shark i usually stay away from movies like that e g scary movie the naked gun etc the trouble is i honestly never thought the <UNK> 11 films would go in this direction what a shame br br so with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window and the plot now <UNK> in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience the heist actually happened way back in the story and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless <UNK> yes that's right steven and his actor friends all get up point at us the audience and say ha you've all been had thanks for your money then they give us the single <UNK> <UNK> br br well right back at you i didn't actually pay to see this movie i <UNK> the dvd for nothing how <UNK> like them <UNK> now that's a plot twist
<START> this is a cult film for many reasons first because of the phenomenal success as a musical both in broadway and london then as a musical film the film is close to the play and some of the <UNK> of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later the <UNK> against the vietnam war is no longer a protest song against the war itself but a strong song <UNK> how the young people of these late 60s managed to bring the political establishment down <UNK> <UNK> play with some situations at the end of the 70s like the narrow minded justice the self centered <UNK> <UNK> of the rich or of the little ones who have just one rank of power more than the <UNK> he also heavily plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time the film remains pleasant and thoughtful and of course it is a tremendous thrill to remember these years when we have had the <UNK> and that was not a chance to live them november 11 1969 <UNK> <UNK> mass celebration for the <UNK> <UNK> which became the order for teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and the march supporting thus the invasion of cambodia that was in full swing and some dare give lessons in democracy to foreign countries i also remember the long campaign for the of <UNK> in 1973 1974 that will eventually lead to his <UNK> and the swearing in of <UNK> ford the first vice president and eventually president of the us who had not been elected since he was <UNK> vice president by the <UNK> after <UNK> had to <UNK> to face trial conviction and sentence for <UNK> of course that makes us think of today when in 2000 a president of the us was not elected by the people but by the supreme court or of a war that was rejected by millions world wide from the very start and even before the start and was started against the better judgment of the united nations and of three permanent members of the security <UNK> and some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others modern western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already widely and wisely changed modern western man seems to be kind of out of sync and to need special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority and the west is far from that majority and that if the soviet block had been able to understand that market economy is not capitalism but that market economy can be either <UNK> or <UNK> the berlin wall would have fallen but the other way round and that china has learned that lesson <UNK> well and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb over to learn that their <UNK> market economy has to lead to political democracy but they will just like vietnam was able to <UNK> itself after thirty years of vicious war <UNK> and damage in other words hair is a perfect food for thought br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK>
<START> one of the enduring classics from mgm came out in the closing years of world war ii it's the film that made young elizabeth taylor a star she had done a few films as a child actress before national <UNK> but when it came out her place in the movies was assured ironically enough <UNK> she'd be growing up fast enough after national <UNK> was out and her next struggle as an actress was to get substantial adult roles because casting directors only saw her as innocent little <UNK> brown who loved her jumping horse br br i'm not sure of how this would work because horses have to have confirmed and the <UNK> are a subject not dealt with in national <UNK> all we know is that he's a reckless and horse in the hands of <UNK> owen and after he breaks free and causes considerable damage owen gets rid of him for a <UNK> price to the local butcher donald crisp br br at the same time as these things are happening mickey rooney comes wandering into the lives of the brown family which consists of crisp wife anne <UNK> and daughters angela lansbury <UNK> <UNK> and elizabeth taylor and their little brother butch <UNK> rooney is a former <UNK> who's now on the open road and heading for the brown family where his father was once a horse <UNK> for anne <UNK> family it's he who sees the potential of the <UNK> short for pirate as a <UNK> and it's elizabeth who convinces crisp not to pass up this chance br br elizabeth taylor was so sweet and innocent in national <UNK> the good book says you have to have faith like a child and she has it to spare she <UNK> rooney with it to have faith in the heart and ability of the <UNK> and to leave a little over for himself br br anne <UNK> won a best supporting actress award for national <UNK> she's a very wise mother who has hidden depths to her that the audience doesn't suspect it turns out that back in her youth she had a taste of fame and glory swimming the english channel and her prize money saved all these years she gives to her daughter that scene is probably what won her the oscar national <UNK> also won one other academy award for film editing br br over 60 years after it made its debut national <UNK> as a family classic hasn't lost a thing its depiction of life between the world wars in great britain is still a standout and national <UNK> launched a movie legend can't do much better than that for high regard
<START> i would hate to have anyone watch this inspired by a true story movie and draw any conclusions about the true event few things they did get right were overshadowed by the things that were just not true ed <UNK> never dragged anyone behind a car never met up with anyone at the graveyard and killed them no proof he returned body parts to the graveyard the things he did were awful enough why try to make it worse br br this movie ranks among my 10 worst wastes of eye strain in the light of the moon is a much better film on the subject it is more factual and the acting is superior in contrast to this one
<START> my brother got me hooked on <UNK> back in the 70s i always loved his <UNK> humor that is looking at every day things and finding the humor in it like asking the question have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket you can't do it they keep bringing back to you and asking questions like why is the word kill more acceptable then the f word while making <UNK> sense with the discussion br br however during the 90s his stuff was less funny and more angry what he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror to <UNK> face and say <UNK> a look ' at this point his shows were less of a comedy show and more of a <UNK> session but in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sense he really made you think br br here was <UNK> old and new he starts out about the fun one could have by getting old and later <UNK> the the state of the world again making perfect sense br br this was his best since <UNK> in new york and as it turns out his last br br i think what 'the was to john wayne or 'a <UNK> home to robert altman <UNK> bad for <UNK> is to george <UNK> a fond farewell to a true great icon love him or hate him i think he will be remembered
<START> i just wanted to say i liked this movie a lot but i also want to ask about something does anyone know the artist song name of the song that the young boy cant remember his name now plays on his cd player when his dad and 2 men comes and takes the tv and the cd player that song is so freaking cool even though i cant understand a word what they're saying feel free to mail me the artist song name at x <UNK> com thanks a lot in advance repeating i just wanted to say i liked this movie a lot but i also want to ask about something does anyone know the artist song name of the song that the young boy cant remember his name now plays on his cd player when his dad and 2 men comes and takes the tv and the cd player that song is so freaking cool even though i cant understand a word what they're saying feel free to mail me the artist song name at x <UNK> com thanks a lot in advance
<START> overall i enjoyed the movie scarlett i am a huge fan of gone with the wind i have read the book and seen the classic movie many times i even have a small collection of scarlett o'hara <UNK> and other things i must admit that gone with the wind is my all time favourite book and movie vivian leigh and clark gable are remarkable actors and two of my favourites unfortunately i was unable to read the book scarlett but i was excited to see the movie truth be told the movie is not any where close to the <UNK> of gone with the wind and neither are the actors however joan <UNK> kilmer and timothy dalton were pleasant actors in the roles and at many times joan sounded like vivian leigh in her portrayal of scarlett dalton also portrayed <UNK> well at times it took some time getting used to the different actors but overall i really enjoyed it being the fan of gone with the wind as i am one major disappointment was that joan did not have green eyes and scarlett o'hara and vivian leigh both did i also found the lord <UNK> absolutely appalling and i did not like his character if you are a gone with the wind fan and or enjoy romantic stories see the movie scarlett however do not expect it to be remarkable like gone with the wind it is far from it although it is interesting with the new characters and so on i am happy it is not a remake and some of the events in the story was what i imagined the <UNK> to be of the scarlett o'hara and <UNK> butler love story if you haven't seen it today get it all tomorrow is another day
<START> you will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it the film opens with images of planes landing at an airport one plane after another diving into a <UNK> filled <UNK> you will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a story at first viewing it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane the initial drama is in the of your perception which is built on your <UNK> to experience the film simply as a series of images if after this opening you want to see the movie you will not be bored you may even be <UNK> the movie may be an emotional experience it may be an intellectual experience it may be both judging from the dvd commentary which is essential it was primarily an emotional experience for <UNK> and at one point he talks <UNK> about how the film is a collaboration between filmmaker and viewer there's plenty of room for the viewer to make of this film exactly what he or she wants to make of it take a <UNK>
<START> while this film might not be the next evil dead hell who knows maybe it will it has only been out for a year it is worth a look don't expect a 10 million film <UNK> you'll be disappointed do expect to be entertain to laugh and to enjoy the experience all in all this film is much better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there i have seen films that spent more than 10 or 20 times what this film cost to make and turned out times worse the effort that was put into this film far out <UNK> the set backs it faces by having a limited budget movies are meant to entertain and this movie sure does that in fact this film might even open up new doors for you in movie watching it's available on netflix if not your local video rental store so watch it then decide
<START> the characters are annoying immature and <UNK> madison being the most annoying of all <UNK> a cold spot such a dire threat any ghost in that house would have <UNK> in self defense to make a long story short this movie is boring seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy but that's about as intriguing as it gets i watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again i was tempted to take a baseball bat to the tv set rather than watch this rubbish again if you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy this isn't it the only good part of the whole thing was the roach scene and by the end of the movie you ended up feeling sorry for the roach
<START> the most <UNK> movie in the history of cinema this one is a strong <UNK> why wasting so much money for such a pointless useless work the only difference between the hitchcock classic and this poor imitation is color wide screen and <UNK> <UNK> a movie <UNK> supposed to generate thrills and fear leaves me completely indifferent br br no <UNK> re going to tell me it will urge the young generations to see the original this psycho 1998 is a giant spoiler br br they could have done something different for instance by casting an actor closer to <UNK> 's bates an <UNK> man they content themselves with an obnoxious rehash a <UNK> on it and long live alfred hitchcock
<START> my roommate and i have another friend that works at a local blockbuster video he finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them one of them was a christmas horror film starring former professional wrestler bill goldberg as a killer claus we didn't watch it immediately but we didn't think there could be anything worse apparently we were wrong we were shown this slasher film starring ken <UNK> versus a murderous scarecrow at first we thought ken would actually be the killer scarecrow and that's why we wanted to watch but he wasn't and that made the movie even worse what absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama if you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head never ever watch this movie
<START> steven <UNK> intent is to be <UNK> and his acting in this film is equal to that in many of his others if you ignore the fact that he is supposedly portraying a brilliant scientist the problem i had was with two items of the plot which stretched my suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point br br first how is it that a carefully <UNK> variation on a nasty <UNK> whose <UNK> must be just as carefully <UNK> and <UNK> by a big lab is <UNK> by drinking tea from a flower growing high in the mountains and that <UNK> family seem to be about the only people who know anything about this br br second and this one really takes the cake having gathered up enough of the cure to fix a whole town wouldn't you expect the army to land the helicopter and start <UNK> <UNK> of flowers to all the homes in this small town no they instead decide to <UNK> the flowers all over the town and force the sick people to go out and gather them up all over again just plain silly unless under native belief the power in the drug somehow depends on one's having gone out and gathered the flowers <UNK> br br add in the cardboard nature of the villains and the <UNK> of the title and you might think my vote on this movie is actually high
<START> it's times like these i truly wish i was a more avid reader of clive <UNK> literary <UNK> since very few things feel worse than not being able to fully comprehend a movie of this stunningly caliber based on the <UNK> <UNK> the story of involves a amount of lavish and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground society of demonic <UNK> a normal guy becomes linked to the strange world called through his dreams and his psychiatrist <UNK> him into believing he is responsible for a series of gruesome murders of families in recent months thinking this to be true he <UNK> to located under a rural cemetery where he is reluctantly accepted the shrink however is right on <UNK> with a diabolical scheme to whip out the community of br br wanting so much to love this movie i was very let down in the long run i have <UNK> not read the story so <UNK> fantasy world and the purpose of it and all these monsters was horribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven i understand how the final cut was <UNK> to hell and even barker show's <UNK> dislike for the overall product but i just didn't get it even if it is crucial to read the story i feel like it should at least be translated to film in a way that it is still <UNK> for those unfamiliar with the literature if <UNK> is as convoluted as this film than barker really <UNK> a dead concept couldn't help but feel a bit bored after a while especially when things started getting increasingly ridiculous somewhere around the jail scene i realized just how bored i was like a police department <UNK> going to war with like it happens every week no one seems to think the idea of immortal monsters is a tad strange i did like the visual effects and all that crazy sh t that went on in especially that <UNK> lady and that big headed <UNK> definitely an epic flick when you consider the massive <UNK> of effects and convincingly morbid <UNK> david <UNK> fills his position well as the loony shrink with his cool <UNK> head <UNK> sack mask but we all wish he had done some behind the camera work to help save this heap br br so if you have a <UNK> for clive barker material and fully grasp what exactly is why they show the creatures during the opening title sequence terrible idea and why these creatures <UNK> there and how some punk kid shares a <UNK> link to it you should probably check out i'll look for <UNK> one of these days and hopefully gain some perspective or maybe i'll just forget this travesty completely until then this is a poorly constructed and fairly tedious mess of a movie watch <UNK> instead
<START> the connection with james dean in a short plan we see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a teddy bear remember the first scene of <UNK> rebel without a cause moreover the main conflict is <UNK> versus sheen father against son as in east of <UNK> the soldier has come home and nobody has been able to communicate with him even his sister a psychology student what a <UNK> the mother a crude <UNK> a superb kathy bates gets <UNK> down in she 's not able to understand that her values religion family have become a thing of the past specially for someone like his son whose innocence was betrayed the father an <UNK> man under his wife's thumb although he tries hard to play the macho wanted to make up for the mediocrity of his life so he saved his honor by forcing his son to do his duty the scene in which hatred for his father explodes is very intense the actor director gives a restrained performance as lee students used to do and his final burst of anger is <UNK> <UNK> so
<START> i was surprised how much i enjoyed this sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from <UNK> also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous <UNK> there are also some spectacularly female dead bit more perhaps but most effective there is also a sci fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but i wouldn't bother too much with that no here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still without memory my dvd <UNK> mentions david <UNK> and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning <UNK> setting at the end
<START> valley girl launched nicolas <UNK> career and was an 80's version of romeo and juliet it is a definite example of an 80's teen classic nicolas cage deborah <UNK> and elizabeth daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie but it will never top fast times at <UNK> high as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for fast times then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head that's for sure
<START> excellent story telling and cinematography poignant biting social commentary br br superb effects well filmed and acted br br however the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures though very well done at times drags on a little too much about 3 <UNK> and over <UNK> the flow of the story br br i first read the book as a child and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the tiny people but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land of the <UNK> well although the adventure plot may sound like a children's story it's in fact a very adult story full of symbolism about the moral <UNK> in england at the time of jonathan swift the author of the novel that the film is based upon
<START> a <UNK> <UNK> in the imdb bottom 100 upon viewing this it's not hard to see exactly why for it proves to fail utterly miserably in just about every bloody department going br br take the editing for a start to call this choppy would be overly <UNK> indeed had the makers of this got drunk one night and <UNK> and <UNK> the film <UNK> with some <UNK> and children's <UNK> then the resulting mess could hardly have been any worse than what we actually have here added to this the inane story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a <UNK> <UNK> before we finally reach the decidedly <UNK> climax br br aside from the ever game michael poor performances from most of the rest of the cast don't exactly help matters any either and the actual <UNK> that is causing all the troubles is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly <UNK> <UNK> all in all this is a complete pile of crap if ever i've seen one br br <UNK> <UNK> me and to think that <UNK> <UNK> directed this to <UNK> <UNK> indeed br br note this was released in the uk under the alternative title of <UNK> waves although <UNK> of most of its gore scenes which ironically are just about the only reason that this may have been worth watching
<START> i'm sorry but this guy is not funny i swear i've heard heard 4 year olds come up with better jokes then some of his dee dee dee for instance is possibly the worst catch phrase i've ever heard it lacks any creativity at all and to be making fun of mentally challenged people when you've reached level of having your own show is incredibly dim witted on <UNK> part br br though every one <UNK> this fool to their is no contest first off they had very very different shows i think all in all show on average had only about 2 short 5 minute skits in between his 10 minute <UNK> about god knows what show came off more as sketch comedy with 2 4 skits that occupied all the show all did was a short <UNK> of each skit before and after each one this is where <UNK> fails even more what would make <UNK> think having a show which consists of the same <UNK> comedy that he talks about on his <UNK> <UNK> would be a <UNK> idea does anybody really want to listen to a bit george lopez <UNK> years before <UNK> but just dragged beyond belief to the point where its dead chance in hell br br my point is even though most people hate this guy for his <UNK> i just cant stand him for his comedy central was looking for a minority they could brand as controversial and then leave him to follow path the problem is this guy made it very clear he doesn't want to be so instead he <UNK> his crappy show like a burning <UNK> right into the ground does anybody want to watch a weekly <UNK> about the same stuff every <UNK> i know sure as hell i don't br br i cant express my <UNK> to comedy central though this show is done personally after watching his <UNK> i don't know how he got his own show in the first place there are so many more deserving comics like jim <UNK> etc in fact anyone is better than this fool
<START> many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of the man who knew too much which i have not had the opportunity to view by itself the <UNK> version is a very well done film the run of mid to late fifties hitchcock films including rear window <UNK> m for murder vertigo and to catch a thief as well as this film is one of my favorite periods in his career in the man who knew too much jimmy stewart throws himself <UNK> into his role as always doris day is very believable in the role of an <UNK> hitchcock blond i thought there was nothing fake about her performance her character may not have been written as strongly as the original but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive yes dear pretty thing on jimmy stewart's arm br br there were some really clever lines written for hank the <UNK> son who later gets kidnapped in the opening scene on the bus it's too bad christopher olsen read them so <UNK> it's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s though most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent though most notably the assassin played by <UNK> br br some little touches that make this film undeniably <UNK> the use of non english dialog especially french something <UNK> did on a much larger scale in to catch a thief the use of foreboding <UNK> music in the hotel when the assassin appears stewart and day talking to each other in the church singing their words to the tune of the <UNK> the albert hall scene specifically showing the musicians and the <UNK> <UNK> following the score building up tension as well as the <UNK> getting the ready and finally the <UNK> gun as it appears from behind the curtain it moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done <UNK> an effect <UNK> used at the end of <UNK> also br br all in all the man who knew too much is a fun film to watch it's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films vertigo strangers on a train but all the same it is one of my top five hitchcock masterpieces
<START> this was included on the <UNK> shorts volume 2 a rather dull collection of short films shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people <UNK> this second collection had a hard time finding quality content and it wasn't nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts <UNK> br br this short film feels like it's woefully <UNK> there is a story but so much in unanswered that the viewer like me feels a bit left out and <UNK> br br the film begins with a woman her boyfriend and her that's a dog by the way going to a lonely beach the lady speaks with an accent that at times is a bit difficult to follow given that i am hard of hearing i sure would have loved if it had been closed <UNK> anyway the boyfriend goes for a swim while she <UNK> when she <UNK> her dog is gone she <UNK> and makes the guy follow her all about looking for the dog they spend most of the time arguing and being <UNK> then out of the blue they stop to have sex later they find the dog end of story br br as far as the characters go both seemed rather dysfunctional and unlikable she was a <UNK> and demanding lady and he seemed to have contempt for her when you wondered why they were together their little sex break showed what bond kept them together br br some might like the characterizations i kept finding the people irritating and unreal more like caricatures than people you might meet or know also the payoff for all this just isn't worth the wait unless you want to see the guy naked
<START> the above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film as the series followed a very similar format as usual simon <UNK> the saint meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid he also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a <UNK> along the way he meets some interesting supporting characters this time paul as <UNK> gates and during his <UNK> of this not especially compelling mystery none of them really are <UNK> is extremely <UNK> and just plain cool george sanders is once again the <UNK> sophisticated british do <UNK> and he succeeds once again in making an excellent b detective series film nothing particularly special but a familiar and <UNK> product sure to please fans of the genre
<START> la <UNK> del or terror express as it was called on the version i saw starts as various passengers board a long distance train three <UNK> idiots dave phil ernie <UNK> de board it's clear that they're there to cause trouble as they <UNK> <UNK> abuse the other passengers staff as the train <UNK> along things turn nasty when a prostitute named juliette <UNK> refuses to have sex with dave he his mates decide to hold the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with juliette well not much else actually happens apart from some hero cop his prisoner who set about saving the day <UNK> that's it really br br this italian production was directed by is complete total utter crap from start to finish the script by george <UNK> as <UNK> could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horror thriller it is <UNK> slow it's 35 minutes before anything even remotely sleazy happens as a whole the film lacks the sort of exploitation elements that italian sleaze horror was delivering at that time the film can be compared to another italian production the infinitely better the house on the edge of the park 1980 made the same year it's a very broad comparison though as everything that made the house on the edge of the park the notorious film that it is is absent from la <UNK> del there's no blood no gore almost no violence there's only a couple of really tame rapes the story has no twists or turns as it's incredibly boring to watch italian sleaze horror from the late 70's early 80's isn't known for it's strong story lines or great scripts but this films really does <UNK> the bottom of the barrel on all counts the character's are awful the film spends the first 30 plus minutes building them up giving some background as to why they're on the train but this is all quickly forgotten comes to absolutely nothing i hated the lame ending as well i don't know if i missed something but was any sort of reasonable explanation given as to why these three would <UNK> a train i don't think there was was there i'm sorry but because your angry at a prostitute is not enough of a reason surely the filmmakers could have come up with something a bit more substantial interesting if not more plausible in my opinion this film stinks it's as simple straight forward as that i'm afraid br br director does an ok job to be fair he only has one <UNK> a few train <UNK> to work with so i'll cut him some slack having said that the film does become very repetitive there is no style he films the sex scenes like a bad soft core porno complete with awful romantic sounding piano music there is not one single drop of blood <UNK> in the entire film that's right not one single drop forget about any gore or violence as you'll be very disappointed if you do like i did there are a couple of rapes but they're <UNK> staged have zero impact the nasty exploitation sleaze of say i spit on your grave 1978 or the last house on the left 1972 is not here br br technically la <UNK> del is ok it's quite well made on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped keep the cost down to a minimum the acting is poor as usual although since it was dubbed the original performances have been lost fans of italian horror will <UNK> a lot of the voices here br br la <UNK> del is a terrible film it's just my opinion but i was bored to tears waiting for something to happen when it eventually never i felt cheated i want those 80 minutes of my life back this piece of crap isn't even fit to grace the <UNK> vhs bargain bin in your local blockbuster one to avoid
<START> i was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater i've thought about it frequently ever since after two dvd viewings i'm glad to say it held up perfectly like any great comedy i laughed more on each viewing both in anticipation of gags but also after catching things missed before br br mike judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense in office space the environment make the characters believable future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work i'll be waiting to see if they release a better dvd with some actual features before buying it but this movie deserves the support on dvd not offered to it at the theater
<START> this is a story of a long and awkward love the daily life of a woman of 50 years old and some people around her is depicted her daily life is so ordinary and routine that i <UNK> who was the real lead character in the beginning then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her high school class mate had very tiny connection the woman has been doing the same job a milk woman and a supermarket so long there are so many <UNK> that delivering milk <UNK> is a very hard job the man had married another woman who is now dying of cancer he works at the city hall and <UNK> cares her at home they never look straight nor talk each other but they never forget each other br br the original japanese title means at some time the days you read books but of course when the man said now i want to do what i've always wanted to do it was to hug her and make love with her she writes to a radio <UNK> <UNK> that if god gives us time to talk we need at least a whole day dreaming of that day she has been the desire in hard work and book reading i personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years even after he married another woman and died for an accident therefore the story setting is not that special rather this movie well portrays <UNK> romances in many ordinary men and women through this movie you will recall your romance that is lost long ago this is a movie with lasting effect
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is considered by many to be the greatest poker <UNK> player of all time an extraordinary self destructive force of nature tiny in stature but a huge heart for the game br br what we have here is a kind of hallmark film about the dangers of gambling sure he wins he loses he blows it all on sex drugs and more gambling we get it but where is the real play where is what made him the greatest card player of all time br br much too flat and frankly boring in places this gets a four because we get to learn something about <UNK> the man but <UNK> the card player <UNK> br br nicely shot and presented up to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a film about cards honestly coverage of the world series is more watchable than this br br a waste of a great chance
<START> terrible boring zombie sequel is only <UNK> better than <UNK> horrible first film it consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the <UNK> these soldiers are your typical <UNK> to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out or at least aren't very interesting so you don't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are <UNK> of the film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter it even has the same <UNK> on guts it just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory and the story's climax is rather anti climactic and ridiculous one wonders how two people can <UNK> in an army of zombies and not get bit for they are the main stars who seem to always manage while others seem to get bit rather easily the film sole motivation is to show people getting bit nothing else just go watch a romero film for lasting effect
<START> caper film is not as good as his most famous movie the deliciously stylish le <UNK> 1968 i don't even think this is the best example of the much loved heist <UNK> the main thing against the film is its long running time has this tendency of <UNK> on too many trivial details he could have told the same story in a relative short time but for reasons that i don't understand the film seems to go on and on still the movie is never boring <UNK> direction impressed me and the cast is very good especially <UNK> <UNK> as a very cool master thief the movie's must see color photography is a great asset and <UNK> uses sound or lack of sound in a very effective manner from a technical standpoint the movie is practically flawless at times one gets the feeling that is merely showing off but when someone is as talented as he is one has little reason to complain i still like other heist movies a little bit more jules <UNK> <UNK> 1964 just to name one but there is no denying that this film is a good piece of pulp entertainment and a good example of what people refer to as cool cinema
<START> hey its great not to have to wait for the next star trek convention to see <UNK> trek its a cheesy film by a bunch of with no budget but a good way to spend an hour they got most of the special effects right the dialog is classic trek and it just feels right for a trek <UNK>
<START> i saw this superb documentary at the santa barbara <UNK> film festival it is extremely absorbing and very well crafted drawing you into the life and career of harry <UNK> one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960's and 70's while i was familiar with his better known compositions one is the number without you i learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful singing if you love music you'll find plenty to draw you in to his world which unfortunately <UNK> out of control as his success <UNK> and his past haunted him however sad he nonetheless was completely devoted to his family and you will find yourself so glad to have met this man the profile is effectively told through own words and those of his friends and colleagues a virtual who's who of rock who loved and respected him don't miss this
<START> this is a gently amusing coming of age comedy that comes from the later more mature period of neil simon's writing although there are plenty of <UNK> to go around this is not one of those neil simon pieces where every character <UNK> out one liner jokes for 2 hours like they're guest stars on a bob hope special there are also dramatic elements some work some are <UNK> that lend some weight to the story br br the performances are good across the board especially <UNK> <UNK> as the mother although she and <UNK> were oddly <UNK> ish choices to play jewish women i've never been a fan of jonathan silverman but i will say that he hits the right notes as the obnoxious <UNK> and totally <UNK> up teen age narrator protagonist of the story br br the movie is very similar in tone to woody allen's radio days but the latter is far more imaginative and funny than this one
<START> great 1980s comic strip comedy set in the south west of england it is a tale of sex drugs cream and murder by the <UNK> adrian french and <UNK> <UNK> hilarious in drag and <UNK> <UNK> play a part dennis tries to impress girlfriend by <UNK> he is involved in a multi million pounds drug deal this leads to complications with hilarious results i am trying to find out the original picture ratio for this film but it does not appear under <UNK> of the imdb site i spotted the dvd in the shop and it appears to be in 1 33 1 full screen format was the film shot in this ratio or was it originally a widescreen film with a pan and <UNK> dvd it would be useful to know as i hate pan and <UNK> films so come on imdb could you find out for us
<START> this is possibly the most perfect film i have ever seen in acting adaptation and direction it is self contained and of a kind so there is no point in saying that it is better or worse than other great films just that it can stand by itself as a perfect work of art br br and it was fun watching confused horror fans getting up and walking out
<START> i just adore this film i love all characters and i can watch it again br br and again and i use to listen to the soundtrack again and again br br although i have seen it about two years after it was made and i br br have never been such <UNK> as <UNK> and company i can br br understand them and i love their stories and if somebody thinks this film is crap i disagree and i say it is br br full of positive energy and friendship and love and full of youth br br the weekend has landed enjoy it
<START> this might sound weird but i only got to see the first movie the <UNK> new groove a week ago and only because of one episode of the tv show i simply adore character but isn't that bad either anyway eventually i decided to watch the second film just so i would've seen it hoped it would be as good as the first one but i'm sorry to tell this but the more the humour got american the more i <UNK> i agreed with when he started crying seeing all the cheesy footage br br still younger kids and probably veterans too will love this movie to bits if they like the old school <UNK> disney that is but i just had expectations that were an <UNK> <UNK> little bit hell of a lot higher than they should've been is a lovely character being good hearted and dumb all at once but it were and in drag that woke me up at the end of the movie i'll ignore <UNK> for as far that's possible br br anyway great movie just not my style and as they say you always have to be true to your groove
<START> in 60s hong kong a man and woman move in the same day into <UNK> apartments with their respective <UNK> soon they suspect their ever absent <UNK> of having an affair with one another a strange bond emerges between the man and woman as they cope with their sadness by taking turns playing each other's <UNK> before a more complex bond emerges br br no summary can do it justice for hong kong auteur wong <UNK> <UNK> in the mood for love is nothing short of a miracle a story about sadness that manages to be touching and at times funny a romance that never feels forced or fake no doubt the director's method has a lot to do with that br br directed from an <UNK> screenplay though the concept largely flows from a japanese short story to favor <UNK> the film is immediately set apart by the <UNK> of it's performances all the film revolves around that and the rest is pure <UNK> at the core of the film are two characters that will ease into your heart and stay there long after the end credits roll maggie cheung and tony <UNK> are simply amazing and no language <UNK> <UNK> a single <UNK> of <UNK> and truth they display the additional material is also top notch the films is magnificent to behold in part <UNK> by hero 's christopher doyle and the music is heartbreaking br br this is something everybody must see if only because it is by far the most heartfelt mature and authentic love story out there <UNK>
